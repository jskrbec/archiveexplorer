1798381>Getting By on a Wing and a Parachute The small plane that crashed in Manhattan last week, killing the Yankee pitcher Cory Lidle and a flight instructor, was equipped with a parachute designed to lower the plane and its occupants safely to the ground in an emergency. No safety device would be of much use when a plane collides with a building, as Lidle&#39;s did, but in other situations, does a parachute for a plane make sense?  <p>Cirrus Aviation, the maker of Lidle&#39;s plane, thinks so: the company includes the system on all its models. It is the only manufacturer to do so, although parachutes can be installed on some other planes. Chutes have also been used with ultralights.</p> <p>Alan Klapmeier, a Cirrus founder, was involved in a midair collision in 1985 in which the pilot of the other plane was killed. The experience caused him to investigate systems that would make it easier to land a damaged or out-of-control plane.</p> <p>Some aviation experts were skeptical, saying that most emergencies are better handled by keeping the plane powered and that a chute creates other risks -- of electrocution, for example, if the plane hits a power line.</p> <p>But Cirrus says that since 1999, when the first model was introduced, parachutes have been used nine times, saving the lives of 21 people. (In that same time there have been 26 fatal crashes, killing 51.) The latest parachute landing occurred in August near Indianapolis, when a pilot apparently had a stroke. One of his three passengers deployed the parachute, and the three survived.</p> <p>While a parachute may help in some circumstances, often a plane is too low, or moving too fast, to use it safely. And deploying it may take more level-headedness than some pilots can muster in an emergency. A parachute landing may severely damage the plane, which can cost $200,000 or more. A landing can also cause injuries; a pilot may try to tough it out and hope to regain control by less drastic means.</p> <p>MATTHEW L. WALD</p> <p>The Basics</p>
1811499>World Briefing | Americas: Brazil: 2 U.S. Pilots In Fatal Collision Return Home The two American pilots of an executive jet that collided with a Brazilian airliner over the Amazon in September got their passports back and boarded a flight home, but not before the Brazilian police accused them of criminal conduct. Federal police in São Paulo said the two, Joseph Lepore of Bay Shore, N.Y., and Jan Paladino of Westhampton, N.Y., had been charged with &#39;&#39;exposing a ship or airship to danger,&#39;&#39; a crime committed &#39;&#39;in the involuntary mode,&#39;&#39; a statement said. The crash killed all 154 people aboard the airliner, a Boeing 737 operated by Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes. MATTHEW L. WALD
1751051>Regulators Consider 50-State Technology DESPITE their fuel economy advantage and a core of loyal customers, no new diesel cars can be sold in states that have adopted California&#39;s stringent emissions rules. Whether a car could one day meet those standards may depend on the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s approval for a method of treating exhaust gases that is now used at coal-fired generating plants. The technology, selective catalytic reduction, cuts nitrogen oxides, which contribute to smog and acid rain. A chemical called urea is sprayed into the exhaust ahead of a catalyst, helping to convert nitrogen oxides to nitrogen molecules (a nonreactive gas that makes up about 80 percent of the earth&#39;s atmosphere) and water.  <p>DaimlerChrysler uses the technology for trucks in Europe and would like to bring it here for the 2009 model year. But environmental regulators have not signed off on the concept: the agency requires pollution control equipment to function as a &#39;&#39;black box,&#39;&#39; with no maintenance or replenishment required for 120,000 miles, something the urea supply would need.</p> <p>The DaimlerChrysler system, known as Bluetec, includes a tank that holds five to seven gallons of urea, with refills needed at intervals of 12,000 to 15,000 miles. &#39;&#39;Most of this will get done in oil changes,&#39;&#39; said Simon N. Godwin, the company&#39;s manager of regulatory affairs in Washington.</p> <p>But Michael D. Jackson, senior director of Tiax, a consulting firm in Cupertino, Calif., said: &#39;&#39;The E.P.A. kind of looks squinty-eyed at this. This isn&#39;t like any normal piece of emissions control equipment that they put on a vehicle and forget about.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A more immediate challenge involves a simpler, 45-state form of Bluetec that Mercedes-Benz plans to introduce this fall in its E320 sedan. This system requires low-sulfur diesel fuel, which is not yet available, though federal regulations require that it be available at pumps by Oct. 15. The added cost is expected to be between a penny and 20 cents a gallon, with most estimates coming in at less than 7 cents.</p> <p>MATTHEW L. WALD</p>
585114>Green Taxis and Clean Buses; Transportation for a New-Age Inaugural A new Administration is coming to Washington, and everyone wants to join the parade -- including, quite literally, taxis and buses that run on natural gas and electricity. The taxis are local but the buses are coming by tow truck and flatbed trailer from as far away as Cleveland and Chattanooga, Tenn. During the campaign, Bill Clinton and Al Gore talked about support for alternative forms of energy, a subject that had long interested Mr. Gore as a senator. Now that they are taking office, interest in the alternative-fuel vehicles is intense, at least among purveyors of such transportation.  <p>At the Clean Air Cab Company, which operates six 1993 Chevrolet Caprice cabs in Washington that run on natural gas, James K. Doyle, the founder and dispatcher, described the jockeying for places in the inaugural parade.</p> <p>At one point, he said, his six cabs were to lead the parade, and Al Gore Sr., father of the Vice President-elect, was to ride in one, along with the nominees for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Carol M. Browner, and for Energy Secretary, Hazel R. O&#39;Leary (who, Mr. Doyle pointed out, drove a natural gas car in her last job, as an executive with the Northern States Power Company).</p> <p>Then, Mr. Doyle said, he was demoted to providing one car, &quot;positioned behind the Native American Eskimo group.&quot; More recently, he said, &quot;I&#39;m definitely one, perhaps two vehicles, with the General Motors Impact,&quot; which is an electric car. But, he added, &quot;things change by the minute.&quot;</p> <p>Yesterday, Mr. Doyle said, all six of his taxis were in use ferrying members of the inaugural committee to various functions.</p> <p>In addition, the Consolidated Natural Gas Company of Pittsburgh is supplying one of the six natural-gas-powered buses, its contribution arriving by tow truck from its East Ohio Gas Company subsidiary in Cleveland. &quot;Given what they&#39;ve said about natural gas, that makes this a wonderful showcase,&quot; said Gary Pastorius, a spokesman for Consolidated. The plan is for for Mr. Gore&#39;s family and their guests to ride in the natural gas buses, Mr. Pastorius said.</p> <p>A 22-passenger electric bus came from the Chattanooga Regional Transportation Authority, which owns 2 and plans to buy 22 more, according to Frederick Hitchcock, who is chairman of the authority and president of the Electric Transit Vehicle Institute. The bus, built by the Specialty Vehicle Manufacturing Company of Downey, Calif., spent most of yesterday on the Washington Mall, where it was seen by a few thousand people, Mr. Hitchcock said; it also took members of Congress and their staffs and officials of Federal agencies for rides, he said.</p> <p>The electric bus goes 70 miles between charges, he said, and is well suited to Washington, a city of gridlock both literally and figuratively. When electric vehicles are stopped, they do not use energy, he pointed out, so &quot;it thrives in stop-and-go traffic.&quot;  COMPANY NEWS  Correction:  January 25, 1993, Monday</p> <p>A picture caption in Business Day on Tuesday with an article about taxis and buses that run on natural gas and electricity misidentified Tyrone Cunningham in some editions. He is a driver for the Clean Air Cab Company of Washington.</p>
371447>No Charges Sought Against Nuclear Official The Justice Department has decided not to prosecute the former chief of staff at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, who was found by the commission&#39;s inspector general to have given false and contradictory information to Congress.  <p>A spokeswoman for the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia said last week that &#39;&#39;this office carefully reviewed the matter and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a criminal investigation&#39;&#39; of the former chief of staff, Victor Stello Jr. Last month the nuclear agency&#39;s inspector general told the Justice Department that Mr. Stello had improperly delayed an investigation of unsafe conditions at a nuclear reactor in upstate New York, and had given explanations in Congressional testimony that were &#39;&#39;not credible.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Stello left the Nuclear Regulatory Commission last year when President Bush nominated him to take charge of the plants that produce the nation&#39;s nuclear bombs as Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs. But in April Mr. Stello withdrew his name from consideration, saying the questions that had been raised about him made confirmation impossible.</p> <p>Since then he has been working at the Department of Energy in a lower-level job, which does not require Senate confirmation, but some lawmakers are seeking his ouster. Among them are Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.</p> <p>Word that the Justice Department declined to prosecute Mr. Stello became public after the general counsel for the Department of Energy, Stephen A. Wakefield, wrote Mr. Dingell about the decision in a letter dated July 9. Mr. Wakefield wrote that he had been told of the decision by the United States Attorney&#39;s office for the District of Columbia and that this represented a resolution of the issue.</p> <p>The testimony that was questioned involved whether high officials at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with the approval or involvement of Mr. Stello, tried to oust an autonomous safety investigator, Roger Fortuna.</p> <p>Staff officials sought information from a former instrument technician at the Nine Mile Point nuclear complex in Oswego, N.Y., in the hope it would implicate Mr. Fortuna.</p> <p>The commission&#39;s inspector general, David C. Williams, concluded in June that &#39;&#39;there was no apparent reason&#39;&#39; for a delay in investigating the allegations of falsification of tests and drug and alcohol use by workers at the plant.</p>
321030>Azerbaijani Strife Expected to Lift Oil Prices Throughout the World Western experts say the ethnic strife in Azerbaijan has begun to disrupt production of oil in the Soviet Union, the world&#39;s largest oil producer by far and a large exporter. The resulting drop, which comes on top of a decline that began in mid-1987, is expected to contribute to tighter supplies and higher prices for oil around the world at a time when production is also falling in other regions.  <p>Lower Soviet oil production is likely to mean a drop in exports, and that could be particularly troublesome for the nations of Eastern Europe as they wrest with political upheaval. These nations have relied heavily on subsidized oil from the Soviet Union.</p> <p>But because every oil-thirsty economy drinks from the same barrel, virtually all nations could be affected, market analysts say. The Soviet Union produces about 12 million barrels of oil a day, and exports almost 4 million, including about 2 million to non-Communist nations.</p> <p>While Azerbaijan, a republic bordering Iran, produces only about 3 percent of the Soviet Union&#39;s oil, it is home to two-thirds of the country&#39;s oil services industry, the factories that make the valves, pipes and more specialized equipment needed to operate wells from the Baltic to the Pacific, experts say.</p> <p>Production of that equipment has suffered as the conflict between Muslim Azerbaijani and Christian Armenian workers has increased, said Thane Gustafson, a professor of government at Georgetown University and an expert on the Soviet energy industry.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Beginning with the first strikes and demonstrations in November 1988, the Azerbaijanis would put down their tools to go off to the public square,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;The Armenians, already in fear, would either disappear or lie low. The Russians remaining would lay down tools, because they didn&#39;t want to be left holding the bag and be responsible for the target output.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Of the fighting in Azerbaijan in recent days, Professor Gustafson added, &#39;&#39;All of that is multiplied by 10 in the wake of the most recent problems,&#39;&#39; when the Soviet Army was sent into Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, and when nationalist sentiments intensified.</p> <p>James R. Schlesinger, a former Secretary of Energy, said the disruptions in Baku mean the Soviets &#39;&#39;will be short of oilfield equipment at a moment that they need more equipment if they want to sustain production.&#39;&#39; The disruption, he said, &#39;&#39;is likely to have a long, lingering effect.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Poor Drilling Results</p> <p>The insurrection in Azerbaijan comes on top of a recent history of trouble in the Soviet energy industry. Despite growing demands for investment in other fields and shortages of capital, the country has dedicated huge amounts to drilling in recent years, with smaller and smaller results.</p> <p>American officials say they expect a decline in Soviet oil production of about 2 percent to 2.5 percent a year, even without taking account of the recent violence.</p> <p>Analysts say the oil industry suffers from the inefficiencies and technological backwardness that other Soviet industries face, only on a larger scale.</p> <p>The Soviet oil export picture is also affected by trouble in the nation&#39;s coal mines, experts say. The Soviet Union has had to make up for coal production lost to strikes by burning more oil.</p> <p>The Chernobyl nuclear-reactor accident in 1986, which led to shutdowns at other reactors for safety improvements, has had a similar effect. For years, the Soviet Union has tried to use its coal and nuclear power at home and export the oil to earn hard currency.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;re reaching a confluence of factors that are probably going to send another price shock,&#39;&#39; said Nauman Barakat, first vice president of futures at Shearson Lehman Hutton. Others are predicting at least a bull market for oil.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We are very concerned,&#39;&#39; Mr. Barakut said. &#39;&#39;This might be a blessing for the OPEC cartel,&#39;&#39; he said, by weakening a competitor.</p> <p>The American benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, has been selling at $22 to $23 a barrel in recent days, up $5 from this time last year. Analysts attribute some of the recent strength to expectations of lower Soviet exports.</p> <p>Output Falling Elsewhere</p> <p>The decline in Soviet exports comes as production is falling in other non-OPEC fields, from the North Sea to Alaska, and among some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries outside the Middle East, like Nigeria and Indonesia.</p> <p>Thomas McHale, an economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert and a frequent traveler to the Soviet Union, said a variety of technical and economic problems have been threatening the level of oil production. But he added: &#39;&#39;When you get these political dimensions, all bets are off. This has generated some underlying fear in the United States that has supported our current price spike.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Strife in Azerbaijan could also disrupt the market for refined products. The republic takes in crude oil from Iran and returns it as finished products, said Mehdi Varzi, an analyst with Kleinwort Grieveson Securities in London.</p> <p>The condition of the Soviet energy industry and its prospects have long been a subject for groping estimates and speculation among Western experts and, by some accounts, among planners in Moscow.</p> <p>In 1977, the Central Intelligence Agency forecast that the Soviet Union&#39;s oil output would peak in 1980 and then decline sharply, turning the Soviet bloc into a net importer. Professor Gustafson, in a book published by the Princeton University Press last month, said the C.I.A. forecast might have alarmed even the Soviets, who began spending heavily on energy projects soon after. The book is called &#39;&#39;Crisis Amid Plenty: The Politics of Soviet Energy under Brezhnev and Gorbachev.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Further Decline Expected</p> <p>By everyone&#39;s count, Soviet oil production was down last year, falling by 100,000 to 250,000 barrels a day, and may fall by 300,000 barrels a day more this year, which would probably reduce exports to non-Communist nations to a level below the current two million barrels a day. Some experts think the level is already below that.</p> <p>That oil enters a non-Communist market of about 55 million barrels a day in which virtually all the spare capacity is in a handful of OPEC countries, a situation that makes it easier for producers to agree to reduce their pumping and raise prices.</p> <p>Part of the Soviets&#39; production problem is the natural decline of their major oilfields in western Siberia. In addition, Western experts say, the Soviets lack the technology needed to extract the harder-to-get oil, and are reluctant to spend scarce hard currency abroad to obtain it.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Exploration is about at the limit of their capacity,&#39;&#39; said one United States Government expert, who added that Moscow was talking to Western oil companies about using their expertise. But Western experts on the Soviet Union said newly ascendant environmentalists and ardent nationalists in the Soviet Union would oppose exploiting Soviet natural resources for foreign markets.</p> <p>Some Fields Damaged</p> <p>In addition to a lack of technical innovation, experts say, the Soviets have damaged some oilfields by trying to meet short-term production goals. That has reduced the amount of oil that can be easily recovered.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They worked off five-year plans, and in many cases did short-term, expedient things that in the long term are detrimental,&#39;&#39; said Herbert M. Ryan, a spokesman for Dresser Industries, a Dallas-based oil services company that sells about $100 million a year in equipment and services to the Soviets and is hoping to sell more. &#39;&#39;Well, the long term is now,&#39;&#39; he said. The condition of the Soviet industry has profound implications for the newly independent states of Eastern Europe. Mr. Varzi, the London analyst, who is a former Iranian diplomat, said that last year, exports to Eastern bloc allies totaled 1.5 million to 1.6 million barrels a day, but &#39;&#39;at the moment, they are running not much more than one million barrels a day.&#39;&#39; As a result, he said, those countries will buy from OPEC at a rate of 1.2 million to 1.3 million barrels a day this year, more than double the level of three years ago, assuming no increase in demand. That raises OPEC&#39;s power in the worldwide market.</p> <p>Hard Currency Needed</p> <p>What is more, the Soviet exports to Eastern Europe have been at subsidized prices, but Moscow has said it wants to raise prices.</p> <p>That would help the Soviet Union maintain foreign currency earnings even if the quantity exported were to decline. Nearly half of Soviet foreign exchange comes from energy exports including natural gas, by some estimates, and the need for hard currency is increasing. The country&#39;s external debt has risen in the last five years to about $25 billion from $5 billion.</p> <p>To earn that hard currency, the Soviet economy has paid a very heavy price, experts said. Mr. Gustafson calculated that of the increase in industrial investment from 1985 to 1990, 70 percent went to energy.</p> <p>He and others think the high level of investment cannot be sustained.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The oil sector has taken up an incredible amount of capital over the last 20 or 30 years,&#39;&#39; Mr. Varzi said. &#39;&#39;Some of that capital has got to be reallocated to other sectors if the needs of Soviet consumers are going to be at least partially satisfied.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;With over-allocation, production was beginning to level out,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Now, with under-allocation, what&#39;s going to happen?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>If the Soviet Union makes the ruble a convertible, or &#39;&#39;hard,&#39;&#39; currency, it will find it cheaper to buy its oil from the Persian Gulf than to spend huge numbers of rubles to drill in inhospitable places inside the country, economists say.</p> <p>But other experts say that such a goal is far off, and that no matter what happens to total production, the Soviets will struggle to keep exports high because of the driving need for foreign exchange.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s too essential for them,&#39;&#39; said Robert Mabro, director of the Institute for Energy Studies at Oxford University. &#39;&#39;They will do whatever is possible, and divert resources from other industries.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There has been a traditional pessimism about Soviet oil production, starting with the C.I.A. report, but they have always managed to struggle on,&#39;&#39; he said. The events in Azerbaijan, he added, &#39;&#39;could produce a hiccup for six months or a year, but I wouldn&#39;t rush to conclusions about the longer run.&#39;&#39;</p>
657234>E.P.A. Acts To Cut Sulfur In Gasoline The Environmental Protection Agency will issue regulations today that will sharply limit the amount of sulfur allowed in gasoline in an effort to cut emissions of nitrogen oxides, which cause smog. The regulations may also bar the importation of gasoline from refineries in Venezuela because it does not meet some pollution standards.  <p>The regulations come under the Clean Air Act of 1990, and will take effect from 1995 to 2000. They have been the subject of intense lobbying and negotiations for years between oil refiners, environmentalists and regulators.</p> <p>Richard Wilson, the director of the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s Office of Mobile Sources, said the regulations would require refiners to reduce the amount of sulfur, beginning in 2000. A Different Purpose</p> <p>Sulfur is already limited in motor fuel, especially diesel, to cut soot, but the purpose of the new regulations is different. Sulfur poisons the catalytic converters that cars use to reduce their output of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, two classes of chemicals that combine in sunlight to form smog.</p> <p>Most refiners will have to cut their sulfur content enough to reduce the output of nitrogen oxides by nearly 7 percent. Scientists and environmental regulators in Washington and the state capitals have concluded in recent years that cutting nitrogen oxides, pound per pound, may be an easier way to cut smog than cutting hydrocarbons.</p> <p>Nitrogen oxides come from burning fuels and thus can all be controlled, at least in theory, while some sources of hydrocarbons are natural and therefore uncontrollable. Venezuelan Imports</p> <p>The new regulations will also require imported gasoline to adhere to the same standards as domestic gasoline. Venezuela has argued that the fuel it delivers to much of the Eastern United States differs in composition but is just as clean when it burns.</p> <p>Venezuela is a longtime ally of the United States, and officials in Washington said last month that the State Department had asked the E.P.A. to issue rules in a way that accepted the Venezuelan position.</p> <p>The regulation that affects the Venezuelans takes effect in 1995. Mr. Wilson said that the issue would probably be debated again before then.</p>
513236>Bush Seeks Rules to Lift Sales of Gas President Bush announced his support yesterday for four regulatory changes that he said would raise demand for natural gas and help an industry that has been badly hurt by low prices. The gas industry applauded the announcement, which came shortly before the primary election in Texas, a leading gas-producing state. But environmentalists and consumer advocates said it was not clear whether the changes, all of them under discussion in Washington for months or years, would mean that more gas would be sold, at least in the near future. They also said that one proposed change could cut gas sales and increase pollution.  <p>The changes are intended to lower costs or remove regulatory barriers. They could result in greater use of natural gas in cars and power plants. 2 Problems Not Addressed</p> <p>Edwin Rothschild, an energy expert at Citizen Action, a consumer organization, said some of the proposed changes were desirable because they would promote use of natural-gas vehicles, lowering pollution and reliance on imported oil. But the natural-gas industry&#39;s real problems, he said, are two phenomena beyond White House control: warm weather and recession.</p> <p>&quot;I don&#39;t see this as stimulating a lot of demand quickly,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But the president of the American Gas Association, Michael Baly 3d, said his industry was &quot;deeply grateful.&quot;</p> <p>Possibly the least controversial proposal was the President&#39;s announcement that the Environmental Protection Agency would soon issue an emissions standard for natural-gas vehicles that would help them compete. Federal standards for gasoline vehicles set a limit on hydrocarbon emissions as a way to control smog, but proponents of natural-gas vehicles complain that natural gas itself, while a hydrocarbon, is not an ingredient of smog. So the E.P.A. will issue a standard for emissions of hydrocarbons other than natural gas.</p> <p>There are now no standards for the vehicles. Mr. Baly of the gas association said yesterday, &quot;If you want to start mass-producing these, major equipment manufacturers want a standard.&quot; A Greenhouse Gas</p> <p>But even if emissions of unburned natural gas do not contribute to smog, they are still a pollutant, environmentalists say, because natural gas is a greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming.</p> <p>David G. Hawkins, an air-pollution expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that allowing natural-gas emissions because they did not cause smog was &quot;an example of tunnel vision,&quot; adding, &quot;You could say the same thing about CFC&#39;s,&quot; which destroy the earth&#39;s protective layer of ozone.</p> <p>The White House also said that the environmental agency would change the rules on when changes to a power plant become so extensive that the plant is considered new, and therefore subject to stricter pollution standards. Named after a case involving the Wisconsin Electric Power Company, the &quot;Wepco fix&quot; -- as it is known on Capitol Hill -- would allow utilities to make major changes to dirty old plants without becoming subject to the strict regulations governing new ones. But the fix was rejected by Congress in the debate over the Clean Air Act.</p> <p>If utilities were not subject to rules on new sources of pollution, according to the gas industry, they might take inexpensive steps that would significantly reduce pollution, like &quot;co-firing&quot; coal with natural gas. In co-firing -- when the two fuels are burned together in the boiler -- chemical reactions reduce the total pollution, although the plant is still dirtier than a new one. The Opposite Case</p> <p>But environmentalists say the Wepco fix might not help gas sales at all. Without it, they say, many utilities would be forced to scrap dirty coal-fired plants and build new ones that run entirely on gas; with the fix, they can continue to rely heavily on coal.</p> <p>A third change would give gas-pipeline companies the option to be regulated under an incentive system, rather than the cost-based system that now prevails, but the details have not been established.</p> <p>A fourth would remove a regulatory wrinkle that some people have said could hurt natural-gas vehicles: the issue of interstate regulation. In theory, according to some natural-gas executives, if a car were fueled with natural gas in one state and driven to another, the sale would be interstate and thus subject to Federal regulation, although in practice the issue has not arisen, experts said.</p> <p>The proposed change would make it clear that sales of natural gas for vehicles were not subject to Federal regulation.</p>
810289>In Hearings On Jet Crash, Certification Is New Issue Investigators seeking the cause of the crash of a USAir Boeing 737 near Pittsburgh 14 months ago still have no answer, but they laid the groundwork today to question whether the plane, the world&#39;s most popular commercial aircraft, had been properly certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. The issue, in a rare second round of hearings conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board that began today, is whether a 737 can be brought down by the sudden, uncommanded movement of the rudder all the way to one side,  which appears to have been the case in the Pittsburgh crash, which killed 132 people, and the crash of a United Airlines 737 near Colorado Springs in 1991 that killed 25. Those two are the only major crashes that the safety board has not solved.  <p>Board officials, joined by the Air Line Pilots&#39; Association, closely questioned a Federal Aviation Administration engineer about whether the airplane could survive such a rudder swing and if not, how the Government could allow it  to fly. The engineer, Michael Zielinski, led the team that conducted a &quot;critical design review&quot; of the 737.</p> <p>Mr. Zielinski said today that a single failure that would prove fatal was acceptable if the chance of failure was 1 in 1 billion hours of flight time.</p> <p>But Ronald L. Schleede, deputy director of the Office of Aviation Safety at the board, asked Mr. Zielinski whether acceptance was based &quot;on assessment that  failure was improbable, or that it could be controlled by alternate means.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Zielinski replied: &quot;It&#39;s both. An analysis was made, and there may or may not have been an alternative way to fly the airplane.&quot;</p> <p>But he said that because of the &quot;remote nature&quot; of the threat of failure, officials of the aviation agency had made an &quot;engineering judgment&quot; that the design was acceptable.</p> <p>The safety board&#39;s function is to determine the causes of accidents in order  to prevent recurrences. To its frustration, the board has not found the cause of the Pittsburgh and Colorado Springs crashes, but it is looking into whether the  Government&#39;s initial decision that the plane&#39;s design was good was properly arrived at.</p> <p>No one suggested today that flying in a 737 was unsafe: in fact, staff members of the safety board have previously made the point that 737&#39;s are statistically safer than many others, despite the two unexplained crashes.</p> <p>The original 737 models were approved by the aviation administration in 1967; newer versions, including the one that crashed near Pittsburgh, were approved in 1984, but with less analysis than would be required for an entirely new design.</p> <p>The safety board is an independent agency that can make recommendations to the aviation administration, The Boeing Company, the airlines, or other parties. Its main task now is to find the cause of the Pittsburgh crash; if it does, it will issue a formal report within a few weeks on how to avoid recurrences. The board could also call for changes to planes now in service, changes to inspection procedures or changes in how the F.A.A. approves new designs.</p> <p>The safety board has no direct evidence that the rudders in the two doomed airliners swung hard to one side, because the planes&#39; flight recorders were of an old design that does not record that data. But the recorders do show the planes&#39; trajectories, and investigators have found no other explanation that fits that data.</p> <p>A Boeing spokeswoman, Elizabeth Verdier, suggested, however, that if there was no evidence of mechanical failure, perhaps there was none. But Ms. Verdier stopped short of citing pilot error.</p> <p>The Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, which is a party to the investigation along with the pilots and other groups, also questioned Mr. Zielinski today, and in answer to a question he agreed that the plane had met all applicable standards when it was approved.</p> <p>The safety board held five days of hearings in Pittsburgh in January and reopened the hearings today.</p> <p>&quot;Areas that are no longer being actively pursued,&quot; said Thomas E. Hauter, the board&#39;s chief investigator, include a bomb, inadvertent deployment of an engine  thrust reverser, loss of a door, shifting of cargo, interference from a laptop computer, failure of an engine mount or floor beam, or hitting a bird.</p>
1525062>With a Motorized Hub, the Wheel on the Bus Goes &#39;Round MOST electric vehicles work by connecting the wheels to a motor. But tomorrow a Dutch company plans to unveil a bus in which motor and wheel are one, a refinement that promises more miles per charge and a vehicle that is safer and easier to maintain. The company, e-Traction, has modified a city bus as a diesel-electric hybrid. It has a small combustion engine that charges the batteries, but propulsion comes from two electric motors with tires attached that serve as the rear wheels. E-Traction, based in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, where the bus will operate as part of the local transit service, predicts that the system will more than pay for itself because diesel fuel consumption will be reduced by 70 percent.  <p>The idea of such a wheel-motor was first advanced by the automotive pioneer Ferdinand Porsche more than a century ago. Many companies have since tried to popularize such a motor, and a few are currently producing them -- including WaveCrest Laboratories, a Virginia company that is using a similar motor to power a bicycle.</p> <p>But plenty of technological and economic hurdles must be overcome before such motors gain widespread use in transportation. &#39;&#39;It is the future,&#39;&#39; said James Worden, founder and chief executive of Solectria, a company in Woburn, Mass., that has produced drivetrains for more than 100 hybrid electric buses. &#39;&#39;Whether it is 10 years out, 20 years out or 30 years out.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Worden said he had so far not embraced wheel-motors like E-Traction&#39;s because he felt that the underlying technology was not quite ready. But he said he would stop far short of saying it would never work, for fear that in 20 years, his comment would sound like a buggy manufacturer&#39;s prediction circa 1900 that cars were just a fad and would never replace horses.</p> <p>E-Traction, which has already built a wheel-motor for a forklift truck, claims that the time is now. For one thing, it argues that in mass production, two wheel motors would cost no more than the large engine and other parts that the motors would replace on a regular diesel-powered bus. The prototype bus nonetheless cost $500,000, about two and a half times the cost of an ordinary bus, said Peter le Comte, a spokesman for the company.</p> <p>The circular shape of e-Traction&#39;s motor is not unusual, but the basic parts are reversed. Usually an electric motor consists of a ring-shaped part that does not move, called a stator, through which a current runs, developing magnetic forces that turn the shaft that runs inside it, the rotor. For years, engineers have talked about building a motor in which the shaft is fixed and the ring turns. If the shaft were to serve as an axle, and the ring were to have a tire attached, the result would be a motor that serves as a wheel.</p> <p>Such an arrangement would have only one moving part, and would eliminate the parts of the drivetrain, which transfers power from the engine to the wheels. For example, it would eliminate the differential, gears that allow a vehicle&#39;s wheels to turn at slightly different speeds when cornering. With a direct-drive motor on each wheel, speeds could be independently controlled.</p> <p>Electric wheels would also be a simple way of making a vehicle four-wheel drive. And if one wheel started to slip in acceleration or braking, a central computer could determine that far faster than existing traction control or anti-lock braking systems, advocates say, and make adjustments.</p> <p>Those benefits could be approximated by any vehicle that used one motor for each wheel. But the E-Traction wheel goes two steps further.</p> <p>First, it squeezes into the wheel an electronic part called the inverter, which changes the direct current from the battery into alternating current for the motor. Converting the current elsewhere in the bus would require running long AC cables to the motor, and such cables lose energy, said Arjan Heinen, the inventor of the motor. Running DC cables from the battery to the wheel and converting the power there to AC increases efficiency, he said.</p> <p>In addition, some electronic tricks can make the motor turn at speeds fast enough to run the bus without gears, he said. The result is to drop the gearbox, a source of weight and friction. Unlike vehicles with internal combustion engines, most electric vehicles do not need variable transmissions, but they do need a gearbox of some kind.</p> <p>If something went wrong with the motor, with the inverter or with the chips that control the motor, a mechanic could replace them all in about 25 minutes by swapping out the wheel, Mr. Heinen said. That requires unscrewing 12 to 20 bolts, depending on the wheel, and disconnecting a handful of cables, he said.</p> <p>Yet Mr. Worden of Solectria said that one drawback in the bus design was that the electronics in the motor were in direct contact with the road, not protected like the rest of the bus is by shock absorbers. If the tire hits a bump, he said, &#39;&#39;it beats the living daylights out of any motor or electronics.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>He said the loss of the gearbox was a major benefit, if it could be made to work, but questioned whether having the current inverter in the motor was much of an advantage. Electric buses with inverters nearer the batteries do not lose appreciable amounts of current through the AC cables, he said.</p> <p>Mr. le Comte said the real proof of the design&#39;s viability would be the operation of the bus in Apeldoorn. Meanwhile e-Traction is also working on a Mercedes Jeep borrowed from the Royal Netherlands Army and a Range Rover. Both will have four motors, one on each wheel.</p> <p>WHAT&#39;S NEXT</p>
1553661>Bush Wants Bigger NASA Budget, Official Says The administrator of NASA said Wednesday that the Bush administration would request a 5.6 percent budget increase for his agency for the fiscal year that begins in October, rising to $16.2 billion from $15.4 billion. The administrator, Sean O&#39;Keefe, said the space agency&#39;s budget would continue to rise -- by 4.8 percent in the 2006 fiscal year and 4.7 percent in 2007, with a total increase of $11 billion by 2008 -- to help it get started on the Moon and Mars missions laid out last week by President Bush. The numbers assume that Congress will eventually approve the $15.4 billion for the fiscal year that began in October 2003.  <p>Before the new directive, Mr. O&#39;Keefe said, the plan had been for a flat $15.4 billion budget, and the agency had been told to &#39;&#39;take that number and get fond of it.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>At a breakfast meeting with reporters, Mr. O&#39;Keefe said the agency would realize $6 billion more by scrapping the orbital space plane, a craft that was supposed to replace the space shuttle, and diverting money from other NASA programs.</p> <p>Another craft being developed, the reusable X-37 cargo vehicle, will continue at least to the test-flight phase, in which it will be dropped from an airplane, he said. The X-37, a six-ton winged vehicle that is 27.5 feet long, was to have been sent into orbit in 2003 but has faced a variety of obstacles. One of its goals is to test new heat-shielding materials.</p> <p>Mr. O&#39;Keefe would not elaborate on details of the new objectives, saying that to do so would cut off some areas of thinking. Since the loss of the shuttle Columbia last Feb. 1, he said, NASA has learned to question every assumption and not to cut off areas of discussion.</p> <p>Mr. O&#39;Keefe said the changes his agency had been forced to confront since the accident would be helpful as it turned to designing a new spaceship to carry astronauts. &#39;&#39;In many ways we&#39;re probably in a better position right now than we might have been otherwise,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Make no mistake, the accident really, really shook the foundation of this agency. It forced us to think about these absolutes, things that we take as fact.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The seven Columbia astronauts were lost because foam insulation shedding from the external tank on liftoff punched a hole in the orbiter&#39;s wing, something that NASA engineers had assumed was not possible.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Not a single day goes by when we don&#39;t remind ourselves precisely what the price is for having missed it, for having done it wrong,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s a lot more open-minded environment now.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>As part of the post-Columbia overhaul, he said, a team of mission managers from the shuttle program is in Pasadena, Calif., to observe counterparts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as NASA&#39;s second Mars rover prepares to land on Saturday.</p> <p>The laboratory&#39;s controllers have made changes in the plan for deploying the parachute, firing the retrorockets and inflating the air bags, based on lessons learned in the recent landing of the first rover, he said, and the shuttle mission managers were there to learn about making decisions based on new information acquired during missions.</p> <p>Later on Wednesday, Richard O. Covey, a co-chairman of a NASA panel that seeks to measure the agency&#39;s progress on post-Columbia changes said it was expanding its mission, to review how the International Space Station could be used as a lifeboat if a shuttle were damaged on liftoff.</p> <p>Mr. Covey, a former astronaut, said that because NASA had talked about using the station as a &#39;&#39;safe haven&#39;&#39; for astronauts if a damaged shuttle could not be repaired in orbit, his panel would evaluate NASA&#39;s preparations to do so.</p>
1500912>U.S. Predicts Cancer Deaths at Proposed Plutonium Plant The radiation doses that the Energy Department estimates for workers at a new plutonium factory that it wants to build would cause about one fatal case of cancer for each four and a half years the plant operates, according to the draft environmental impact statement. The number could be larger or smaller depending on the production level. The design is for the plant to run for 40 years, implying a total of about nine fatal cancers.  <p>The estimate is given on the fourth page of an eight-page table, in the third chapter of an 11-chapter first volume of the environmental impact statement for the plant, the Modern Pit Facility. The Energy Department is considering building the plant to make smaller nuclear bombs and bombs to replace old ones that it says may become unreliable.</p> <p>The department is about a year from deciding whether to build the plant, a spokesman said.</p> <p>The estimate was pointed out by Arjun Makhijani, president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, a group that specializes in analyzing environmental and safety problems in producing nuclear weapons. Mr. Makhijani said it was &#39;&#39;unconscionable to build such a risky and unneeded facility.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A spokesman for the Energy Department, Anson Franklin, said the calculation of nine deaths over 40 years was &#39;&#39;a statistical contortion that should not obscure the fact that that&#39;s a very conservative standard for radiation exposure.&#39;&#39; The average annual dose to an individual worker would be about 10 percent of the limit used at civilian power reactors and other radiation environments, according to the report. Mr. Franklin said the number was not that far above natural background radiation that an average person would receive.</p> <p>The department estimate states the risk several ways. It puts the annual risk of a single fatal cancer case at 22 percent, and it says the collective dose to the worker population would be 560 rem. A rem is a standard unit of radiation, and the Energy Department, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Environmental Protection Administration and other agencies use a formula that predicts one cancer death for each 2,500 rem exposure to the population.</p> <p>The narrative section of the environmental statement also predicts that a worker would have to have a 4,900-year career at the plant before developing cancer. The plant would employ 1,800 workers, of whom about 1,100 would be exposed to radiation. Hundreds would be expected to die of cancer no matter their occupations.</p> <p>The Energy Department has not announced the site. But the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C., is a leading candidate.</p> <p>The department&#39;s weapons complex, parts of which date from the Manhattan Project, the World War II effort to build the first nuclear bombs, has a legacy of pollution and disregard for workers&#39; health. Nearly all its major plants were built before the era of environmental impact statements.</p> <p>Early in 2000, the department acknowledged for the first time that workers had been made sick or died because of their occupational exposures. It said at the time that many of the worst abuses were committed in World War II and the cold war.</p> <p>Opponents argue that the Modern Pit Facility would serve no useful purpose. The department has argued that plutonium, the material at the heart of nuclear bombs, deteriorates over time, and thus the hollow plutonium spheres at the heart of the bombs, the &#39;&#39;pits,&#39;&#39; have to be replaced.</p> <p>Mr. Makhijani said, &#39;&#39;There isn&#39;t a weapon in the current arsenal that&#39;s ever had an aging reliability problem.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Other critics question developing smaller weapons. Some military strategists say they would be useful for destroying subterranean military factories or command bunkers. Other critics fear that it would make the United States more likely to cross the nuclear threshold and use weapons in war, opening the door for the wider use of nuclear bombs.</p>
638121>New York City Considers Exporting Trash For the first time, New York City is looking to ship some of its household garbage to other states. With the city&#39;s only landfill, Fresh Kills on Staten Island, filling up, and with plans to build incinerators and expand recycling moving slowly, sanitation officials are considering exporting some of the 14,000 tons of garbage produced each day by households and institutions.  <p>The city hopes to take advantage of an unexpected decline in fees at out-of-state landfills and incinerators, officials say. Emily Lloyd, the Sanitation Commissioner, said in an interview that the city has learned &quot;anecdotally&quot; of a possible surplus capacity for trash at incinerators and landfills around the country.</p> <p>But the city&#39;s search for places to send its trash will run against another trend, a growing fear of imported trash in communities around the country, and the threat of national legislation that would let states close their borders to trash. Landfill Fees Falling</p> <p>The phenomenon that the city is trying to capitalize on is that tipping fees charged by landfills per cubic yard of trash have declined recently, some industry experts say, although the reasons for and likely duration of the trend are not completely clear.</p> <p>James E. Kundell, a landfill expert and professor of environmental policy at the University of Georgia&#39;s Vinson Institute of Government, said that landfills are &quot;going through a transition period&quot; because of changes in Federal regulations. Many will be forced to close, he said, and the result has been the equivalent of a going-out-of-business sale as operators try to fill their landfills before closing them.</p> <p>Some newly established private landfills have opened bidding wars, he said. Meanwhile, the volume of trash from households and businesses has fallen because of the recession, a slowdown in industrial activity and the growth of recycling.</p> <p>An abstrusely worded two-sentence notice scheduled to appear next week in the city&#39;s official publication, the City Record, invites trash haulers and the operators of landfills and incinerators to an informational meeting on Oct. 19. Although the purpose is for the private companies to give the city information, not the other way around, Ms. Lloyd said that she hopes to solicit bids formally by the end of the year.</p> <p>&quot;We want to have a well-informed discussion of what the options are,&quot; said Ms. Lloyd in an interview on Friday. Trash could be shipped by train anywhere in the continental United States, she said.</p> <p>New York City is looking for alternatives to disposing of its waste as Fresh Kills nears capacity and officials continue to have problems building incinerators and increasing recycling. Since 1960, the city has closed 11 landfills and 7 incinerators. Would It Be Economical?</p> <p>An important issue is whether shipping garbage elsewhere would be economical. New York City pays between $15 and $20 to bury a cubic yard of trash at Fresh Kills, and until December 1988 it charged $18.50 to any business that wanted to dump there. But then it decided that beyond the cash outlay, the space itself had value, because it is irreplaceable, and it raised the fee for private haulers to $40, which drove nearly all of them to private landfills.</p> <p>If the Sanitation Department has options to ship its trash outside the five boroughs, it would have to consider whether the increased operating costs are worth it to save capacity at Fresh Kills.</p> <p>In the short term, the Sanitation Department faces a logistical problem beginning in the second half of 1995, when it plans to close a marine transfer station at Hunts Point in the Bronx for a three- to five-year rebuilding project. Each day, Bronx homes and institutions generate about 1,700 tons of trash, which is now loaded onto barges at Hunts Point and shipped to Staten Island.</p> <p>Without the transfer station, the city could send garbage trucks to transfer stations in Queens and Manhattan. But from the Bronx, the only borough on the mainland and the only one with adequate freight rail service, it could also export the waste over land. Minefield of Opposition</p> <p>In discussing a change in how trash is handled, officials are tiptoeing through a minefield laid by two sides: unionized city workers and private haulers. Both sides fear any effort that would upset the current system, in which private haulers take commercial trash and city workers take everything else. But Ms. Lloyd said that if there were any job losses at Fresh Kills or in the medium-sized navy of barges that the city maintains to move garbage around, they would be through attrition.</p> <p>A major question for the city is whether it can depend on outside landfills over the long term. As Ms. Lloyd put it, &quot;we cannot become too dependent on the kindness of strangers.&quot; The city will look for long-term contracts, she said, meaning 15 or 20 years at least, but Congress could pass a law that would allow states to annul such contracts.</p> <p>Local governments and environmentalists already have an informal veto on trash imports in many cases, said Edward W. Repa, the director of technical and research programs at the National Solid Wastes Management Association, a trade association in Washington.</p> <p>Mr. Repa said that it was not unusual for cities to export their household trash.</p> <p>&quot;Usually when you do those contracts,&quot; he said, &quot;You do them in areas where they have the backing of the local community.&quot; Community Backing Crucial</p> <p>Ms. Lloyd said the support of the community getting the trash would be a precondition of any contract. Some communities find that the taxes and jobs generated by operating landfills make importing trash desirable.</p> <p>Environmentalists in New York might also object, although Eric Goldtstein, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that &quot;it&#39;s probably a sound interim step as New York makes the transition to primarily relying on recycling and waste reduction.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;If it&#39;s done strategically, with willing recipients, it could make short-term sense,&quot; he said. &quot;But it&#39;s certainly not the ultimate answer.&quot;</p>
169216>Electricity Use Sets Records Demand for electricity at Midwest utilities set sharply higher records in the last few days. The increases were the largest since the early 1970&#39;s.  <p>Continued hot weather is also pushing demand to record levels in the Northeast, but the increases there are much more modest.</p> <p>The record demand, which has reached levels that were not expected before the 1990&#39;s, reflects both the weather and a resurgence of industrial production. Projections May Be Revised</p> <p>In Chicago, for example, Commonwealth Edison had a record demand Tuesday of 17,107 megawatts, 8.5 percent more than last year&#39;s highest level. The utility, which had not expected that much demand until 1993, has been forced to buy power from other utilities.</p> <p>As a result of the surge in demand, utility companies say, they may have to revise their annual growth projections.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;re seeing a nice little economic boomlet,&#39;&#39; said Paul Knopick, a spokesman for the Consumers Power Company, which serves much of Michigan. The company&#39;s peak load on Wednesday, 5,843 megawatts, was 8 percent higher than its highest level last year. Consumers had not expected to reach that level until the summer of 1992. As a result, the utility, along with the Detroit Edison Company, went shopping for power from neighboring utilities. Higher Costs</p> <p>One result of the surging demand is higher power costs for the utilities, at least for a few days. The effect on consumers&#39; electric bills will depend on how many days the high demand continues. &#39;&#39;Utilities don&#39;t bill on a daily basis, and we don&#39;t know what the rest of the month will be like,&#39;&#39; Mr. Knopick said. Factors ranging from the fall in the dollar&#39;s value, which has stimulated exports, to a decline in unemployment and a general improvement in economic conditions, have lifted electricity use.</p> <p>Commonwealth Edison in Chicago has contracts with some industrial companies permitting it to disconnect them on peak days in exchange for lower rates year-round. On Tuesday, it disconnected about 10 percent of its industrial load, a spokesman, Gerhard A. Wald, said. Such contract clauses are common, and industries usually curtail their operations when the clauses are put into effect.</p> <p>The utility, which successfully fought with its critics in recent years to be allowed to finish several nuclear plants that were over budget, ran full-page ads in Chicago newspapers this week saying, &#39;&#39;The 16,138,000 kilowatts you weren&#39;t supposed to need until 2005 were supplied last Tuesday with the help of two new power plants we weren&#39;t supposed to need until 2005.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Much of the power bought by Commonwealth Edison and the Michigan utilities came from the American Electric Power Company, based in Columbus, Ohio. That company said that on Tuesday peak demand from its own customers - seven million people in seven states - was 7 percent higher than last year. The utility had projected that peak demand would rise only 1.8 to 2 percent a year.</p> <p>American Electric said on Tuesday that it had helped arrange for extra power generation in Georgia to provide power to Michigan, an unusually long distance to send electricity. &#39;We&#39;re Operating Everything&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;re operating everything,&#39;&#39; said Richard E. Disbrow, American Electric&#39;s president, who said it was supplying other companies with up to 4,500 megawatts. That is equivalent to the production of four large nuclear plants and is more power than is generated by some middle-sized utilities. Yet American Electric was still unable to meet all the requests of neighboring utilities.</p> <p>Because many companies are using all their most efficient equipment and are turning to their most expensive generating sources to provide extra power, prices are going up - at least for a few days. Consumers Power, for example, can usually buy electricity in bulk for 2 cents a kilowatt-hour, but lately it has had to pay at least twice that. In addition, Consumers Power is now continuously operating some equipment that was intended to run only in peak periods and that produces electricity for 10 cents a kilowatt-hour. A kilowatt-hour is the amount of electricity required to keep 10 100-watt bulbs lit for one hour.</p> <p>In the Northeast, the growth in demand has been slower. The New York Power Pool - a consortium of seven investor-owned utilites plus the New York Power Authority - reported demand on Wednesday of 25,274 megawatts, up 2.9 percent from the peak set last August. Even that, however, was described as &#39;&#39;pretty dramatic&#39;&#39; by Bryan H. Gosling, a spokesman for the pool, which handles sales of power among utilities.</p> <p>New England, which electric company officials say has a long-term capacity shortage, reported peak use on Wednesday of 19,220 megawatts, slightly below the previous record, set Jan. 14, of 19,277. The peak last summer was 18,058 megawatts. Appeals to Conserve</p> <p>Officials in New England issued a public appeal for energy conservation on Wednesday afternoon and again yesterday morning.</p> <p>William P. Sheperdson, a spokesman for the New England Power Pool, said imports of power from Quebec have had to be curtailed slightly in recent days because of the electricity supply situation in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland.</p> <p>The reason is an electricity distribution system as complicated as a chess board in mid-game. New England must limit its imports of electricity to the maximum amount it could afford to lose suddenly without causing a blackout.</p>
168570>Texaco&#39;s Canadian Unit for Sale Texaco Inc. formally put its 78 percent share of Texaco Canada on the market yesterday. Selling it could bring in as much as $3 billion, which could put Texaco well beyond its goal of $5 billion of asset sales in its post-bankruptcy restructuring.  <p>The subsidiary is Canada&#39;s fifth-largest oil company, and potential bidders include all the major oil companies in Canada. PetroCanada and Husky Oil Ltd., both Canadian companies, and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation of Los Angeles have expressed interest. And Gulf Canada has discussed the idea of buying the company, according to court records.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It is one of Texaco&#39;s better assets,&#39;&#39; said William L. Randol, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation, who questioned whether the proposed sale would benefit Texaco stockholders. &#39;&#39;I would say that every major player in Canada would like to see what&#39;s available,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Rosario Ilacqua, a Nikko Securities analyst, said, &#39;&#39;The reserves are fantastically attractive.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>If the buyer of Texaco Canada is not Canadian, the deal will need approval by the Canadian Government. Also it is subject to an antitrust review in Ottawa.</p> <p>Some analysts suggested that the sale could provide a mechanism for helping Carl C. Icahn liquidate his 14.8 percent stake in the parent company. For example, they said, a buyer could pay Mr. Icahn for his shares and then swap those shares to Texaco for the Canadian subsidiary. When Mr. Icahn, Texaco&#39;s largest shareholder, lost a proxy fight in June, he said he was inclined to sell his stake. It is so large, however, that he could not do so in the open market without depressing the price. Possible Sale Often a Topic</p> <p>Alfred C. DeCrane, Texaco&#39;s chairman, said in a telephone interview that such a liquidation was not part of the company&#39;s plan.</p> <p>Texaco Canada has been frequently mentioned as a candidate for sale. When Mr. Icahn tried to gain control of Texaco this year, he proposed to finance his acquisition largely by selling the Canadian subsidiary.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;What we really realize as shareholders in that company are its dividends,&#39;&#39; Mr. DeCrane said yesterday, &#39;&#39;and on a dividend basis the rate of return is not as high as if it were a 100-percent-owned operation and you had control of the assets, the cash flows, etc.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Texaco should know within weeks whether a sale can be made at an acceptable price, Mr. DeCrane said. With 121 million Texaco Canada shares outstanding and with yesterday&#39;s closing price of $30.75 on the American Stock Exchange, up $1.75, Texaco Canada&#39;s value is about $3.72 billion. Texaco&#39;s share of that is worth about $2.8 billion.</p> <p>Analysts said a buyer would pay a premium for a controlling interest. Sales Beginning to Add Up</p> <p>Texaco, Mr. DeCrane noted, has already sold its West German subsidiary for $1.2 billion and has signed a joint venture agreement with Saudi Arabia that it expects to be worth $2 billion. Selling Texaco Canada, therefore, could far exceed the goal that Texaco set for itself earlier this year of selling at least $5 billion in assets.</p> <p>Texaco also has oil and gas reserves for sale, and their total could be more than $6 billion, said Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc.</p> <p>Texaco Canada has 3,300 employees, 1,800 branded retail outlets and 10.4 percent of the Canadian petroleum products market. It had 1987 sales of $2.65 billion (Canadian), or $2 billion (U.S.), making it the 37th-largest company in Canada, according to the Financial Post 500, a Canadian version of the Fortune 500 list of big companies. On the basis of its net income of $320 million (Canadian), or $241 million (U.S.), Texaco Canada was the ninth-largest company.</p> <p>Texaco said the subsidiary&#39;s assets totaled $3.87 billion (Canadian), or $2.92 billion (U.S.), at year-end.</p>
1579335>Saving Lives In the Skies MEDICAL emergencies may not be the first worry on an airline passenger&#39;s mind, but illness is a bigger risk than a crash; each year, more than 100 people are stricken for some health reason while flying on major American carriers, and die in flight or soon after, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. In most years that dwarfs the number killed in commercial airline crashes; in 2003, 19 passengers and 2 pilots died in an airliner crash, and the year before there were no passenger fatalities. Since last month, all planes operated by United States airlines that have a flight attendant have been required to carry a defibrillator, a device that shocks a human heart back into normal rhythm during a heart attack. Most American carriers operating big planes have been equipped with them for years.  <p>The defibrillator rule should also reduce the chance that a planeload of people will have to make an unplanned stop unless it is absolutely necessary. Before the devices produce a shock for a heart that has gone into a dangerous rhythm, they also provide a diagnosis, determining whether the patient has a heart problem that needs emergency attention, for example. Thus they may help determine that a passenger in distress simply has indigestion that does not warrant an emergency landing.</p> <p>The airlines say they are not sure how often the defibrillators have saved them from having to divert flights, but acknowledge that it is one reason that they are happy to carry them, along with the more obvious one of saving lives.</p> <p>Better Equipment</p> <p>The new rule, which also requires that on-board medical kits be upgraded to include saline solution, intravenous injection equipment and additional drugs, applies to planes weighing at least 7,500 pounds, which generally means those carrying 30 or more passengers. Such planes generally have at least one flight attendant, and flight attendants are trained in first aid. Especially on larger planes, physicians or nurses are often on board as passengers.</p> <p>The defibrillators are designed so that people with no training can use them; they have instructions attached and give audible prompts. However, health experts recommend that a flight attendant be called to use the device if possible.</p> <p>When it issued the final rule in April 2001, the F.A.A. pointed out that it had only a general idea of what medical emergencies occur in flight. For example, the agency may know that a passenger was taken off a plane by paramedics, but sometimes does not know whether the passenger lived or died. &#39;&#39;It is typically difficult to assess why or even what medical event occurred,&#39;&#39; the agency said.</p> <p>The early evidence is that people with little nor no medical training want to defibrillate first and ask questions later. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine, based on two years of experience at American Airlines, the first major American carrier to equip its fleet with defibrillators, found that flight attendants or medical personnel had used the on-board defibrillators 200 times, including nine times when they were carried into the airport terminal. But the machine detected the condition that the shock corrects in only 14 of the patients.</p> <p>The machine will not administer a shock unless it determines, by measuring the patient&#39;s heart rhythms and comparing those to a database, that it is needed.</p> <p>At first, flight attendants started using the devices &#39;&#39;every time somebody complained of chest pain, indigestion, shortness of breath,&#39;&#39; said Joan Sullivan Garrett, a critical-care nurse who is the president and chief executive of MedAire, a company hired by about 70 airlines to train flight attendants and to provide doctors on the ground who are available by radio around the clock, within 60 seconds, for consultation.</p> <p>Ms. Garrett said that medical emergencies represented a growing fraction of in-flight problems. &#39;&#39;Ten years ago, the reasons planes diverted were because of mechanical issues; today it&#39;s because of medical reasons,&#39;&#39; she said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;And the airlines are recognizing that the demographics of our population are changing, and the types of problems we&#39;re seeing are changing,&#39;&#39; Ms. Garrett added, referring to the higher proportion of older people.</p> <p>Defibrillator Prices Fall</p> <p>The government reached the same conclusion, and falling costs have lessened the burden on the airlines. When President Clinton gave a speech announcing the proposed defibrillator rule in May 2002, he said that the devices should cost no more than $3,500, but today the price is closer to $2,000.</p> <p>The first life saved by a defibrillator in flight was that of Michael J. Tighe, who suffered a heart attack, his first, on a flight from his home in Boston to San Diego, in November 1998, on American Airlines.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It was a lucky flight for me,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Tighe, who was then 62 years old. He now has an internally implanted defibrillator.</p> <p>He said he was probably better off on the plane than he would have been at home. In fact, many travelers can attest that airplanes are better equipped for medical emergencies than many homes and offices.</p> <p>Tim Cameron, the lead first-aid instructor at United Airlines, said that the airline first used a defibrillator to save a life in Tampa, when a woman collapsed while waiting on the Jetway to board and another waiting passenger screamed, drawing the attention of a flight attendant already on the plane. A second flight attendant fetched the defibrillator from the airplane. Mr. Cameron said that that was in July 2000, and that he still speaks regularly to the woman who was revived.</p> <p>Another victim, Virginia Monahan, 59 years old, was flying home to California last October and changed planes at Denver International Airport. &#39;&#39;On my way for a cold beer and a sandwich,&#39;&#39; she said, she collapsed in the terminal building. A United flight attendant came to Ms. Monahan&#39;s aid. The flight attendant called a United customer service agent, who grabbed a defibrillator that the airport had stored nearby and used it to revive Ms. Monahan.</p> <p>Rapid Treatment Vital</p> <p>Experts say the chance that a heart-attack victim will survive declines by about 10 percentage points for each minute before the heart is shocked. With defibrillation, survival rates run about 40 percent, experts say; without, they are near zero. Survival rates are best among patients with an abnormal rhythm; that kind of heart problem often kills young people without warning. But when part of the heart muscle dies from blocked blood flow, treatment with a defibrillator may help restart the heart, but the patient often dies from heart damage.</p> <p>Mr. Tighe said that he now asks about defibrillators wherever he goes. He said that the Rotterdam, a cruise ship he recently traveled on, has three, but Burlington International Airport, in Vermont, near where he now lives, has none.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Defibrillators have to be like fire extinguishers,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s so apparent that they save lives.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>PRACTICAL TRAVELER MATTHEW L.

296749>Further Delay Urged for New Mexico Nuclear Waste Dump An already delayed underground nuclear-waste dump in New Mexico, which the Energy Department now hopes to open by 1992 to end a crisis in plutonium disposal, should be delayed two or three more years to insure proper safety testing, a panel of advisers has told the department.  <p>A spokesman for the department says Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is reviewing the advice and has no other comment.</p> <p>The plutonium waste is generated at the Rocky Flats Plant, near Denver, which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs. The plant will run out of storage space for the waste by March, and experts have suggested that it may therefore have to shut down.</p> <p>The $800 million repository, the Waste Isolation Pilot Project, is buried in a salt cavern near Carlsbad, N.M., and is designed to store the waste for thousands of years. It was originally to have opened a year ago, but engineering difficulties have repeatedly delayed its operation. The problem has become critical in recent weeks, ever since Gov. Cecil D. Andrus of Idaho, where the Rocky Flats waste had long been shipped for temporary disposal, became alarmed at the Government&#39;s inability to create permanent storage and barred further shipments. Too Optimistic, Adviser Says</p> <p>The Energy Department confirmed Friday that in the latest development, four of the five advisers who looked into the project told Secretary Watkins on Tuesday that more time was needed to insure that the repository could contain the wastes as specified by regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency. The department, Mr. Watkins was told, has not yet even completed the planning for the tests.</p> <p>The department has said that by 1992, it wants to move 15,000 barrels of waste to the site to check on its own ability to transport and unload the material safely. Full-scale operation of the repositoty would quickly follow.</p> <p>But one of the advisers, Leonard C. Slosky, an environmental consultant in Denver, said in an interview Friday that the department was being too optimistic in setting a 1992 target for completion of its analysis of the dump&#39;s containment ability.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Moving large quantities for demonstration should be delayed until you have greater confidence that the E.P.A. standards can be met,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re saying we think that&#39;s not going to be met until &#39;94 or &#39;95 at the earliest.&#39;&#39; Testing of the Cavern</p> <p>A spokesman for the Energy Department said Friday that he was unable to provide details of the testing needed for such analysis.</p> <p>But Melinda Kassen, a senior lawyer in Denver with the watchdog Environmental Defense Fund, who has followed the project&#39;s progress closely for years, said two tests were involved.</p> <p>One, she said, entails placing the barrels of wastes in a sample of the cavern&#39;s salt, putting both in a sealed container and adding water. The purpose is to simulate water intrusion that could occur in the cavern over the years. This test would be completed after two years, when the barrels would be checked for corrosion and when inspectors would also see whether any gases had been generated that could help radioactive material escape from the cavern.</p> <p>The other test, Ms. Kassen said, entails digging a small alcove in the salt, putting the barrels of waste inside, sealing the alcove and seeing how well both the salt and the barrels perform in containing the waste.</p> <p>But the department has not said how it will seal the alcove, she said, and has not said how it will use the resulting data in operating the repository.</p>
476101>New Setbacks for Nuclear Arms Complex The Department of Energy&#39;s drive to control its broken-down bomb production factories and to get a handle on its monumental waste problems both suffered setbacks yesterday. The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said in a report that the department and its contractor, Westinghouse, knew for months about a huge leak in a waste tank in Washington State but kept it secret, apparently in violation of Federal law.  <p>In another blow, an internal Department of Energy report heavily criticized the work done so far to improve safety at Rocky Flats, a plutonium processing plant near Denver that is at the top of the Government&#39;s list for reopening. The House and Senate are now negotiating over a provision that would take the decision to reopen the plant out of the department&#39;s hands.</p> <p>The waste tank at the Hanford nuclear reservation, has been known for years to be leaking highly radioactive wastes. The Government had estimated that the total amount was 5,000 gallons. But the report issued yesterday by the Congressional agency said Westinghouse and the department knew for months that the tank had leaked far larger amounts of contaminated water, perhaps 800,000 gallons, into the soil, but had kept it secret.  Energy Department&#39;s Defense</p> <p>The larger leak was of cooling water that had been pumped in to keep the contents of the tank from boiling, and Westinghouse told Federal investigators it was following a long-standing practice at Hanford of not considering the water to be a pollutant after it came out of the tank, because at the time it went into the tank it was clean.</p> <p>But the Congressional agency said the water was legally a hazardous waste and had probably helped to spread the high-level radioactive wastes through the soil at the site.</p> <p>Commenting on the two reports, the department&#39;s chief spokeswoman, M. J. Jameson, said, &quot;There&#39;s less of a pattern of negative events than there has been in the past.&quot; She added, &quot;We are wading through the problems, and there are less problems now.&quot;</p> <p>Concerning the internal report on Rocky Flats, she said: &quot;We deserve a pat on the back for that. The Office of Nuclear Safety is up and running, and hence the report.&quot; She added that not all of its findings were new and that this was another encouraging sign, because flaws in the system were being caught at several different levels.</p> <p>Concerning the tank problem at the Hanford site, Westinghouse said yesterday that it had just received the report and was preparing a response.</p> <p>At the Washington Department of Ecology, the state agency responsible for enforcing Federal antipollution laws, Roger Stanley, the deputy director, said in a telephone interview that the auditors&#39; report &quot;shakes our confidence&quot; in Westinghouse and in the department, with which Washington State signed a clean-up agreement in May 1990. That was the most recent of several occasions on which the Energy Department has pledged to obey Federal antipollution laws. The Federal agency has already announced that many of the deadlines in the agreement will be missed.</p> <p>Mr. Stanley said his office would seek legal action against the Energy Department and its contractor under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which requires prompt reporting of all leaks of hazardous waste.</p> <p>The accounting office took up the matter when a staff member at the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee found a discrepancy in waste volumes. Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of that committee, said yesterday, &quot;This report shows a continuing pattern of behavior by the Department of Energy and its contractors to downplay the seriousness of its contamination problems at Hanford.&quot;</p> <p>The larger leak was first disclosed to the state in a footnote to a monthly report in 1989. Senator Glenn pointed out that the leak was not detailed by the Department of Energy until last fall, when internal documents about the tank were surreptitiously released.</p> <p>A spokesman for the department, Kenneth L. Morgan, said: &quot;We report lots of stuff. It&#39;s a big operation.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;We have a process going on here at Hanford to gradually uncover everything that occurred,&quot; he said. &quot;We do not claim to know everything that is reportable.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Morgan said future violations would probably occur. When a new problem that requires reporting is found, he said, &quot;The first person that will see it is some person within the organization, and there are 14,000 people here.&quot; The problem, he said, was that when important information is uncovered, &quot;there will be a lag before it reaches institutional awareness.&quot;</p> <p>At the Sierra Club, Shira Flax, a lobbyist and expert on the weapons production system, said, &quot;Regulation of those tanks is the most serous problem in the whole complex.&quot; Despite promises by the department to comply with Federal laws, she said, &quot;as late as 1989, we&#39;re seeing the Department of Energy saying, &#39;We&#39;re going to decide when we&#39;re going to be regulated and when we&#39;re not.&#39; &quot;</p> <p>In the internal report on Rocky Flats, produced by two of the department&#39;s offices, Nuclear Safety and Environmental Safety and Health, grave faults were found with preparations to reopen part of the plant.</p> <p>An investigative team found &quot;numerous problems in the criticality safety program,&quot; a program meant to insure that plutonium bomb fuel is never accidentally assembled into a critical mass, which sets off a chain reaction. Interviews with workers who handle bomb fuel &quot;identified gaps in knowledge regarding criticality safety and the underlying rationale for criticality safety limits,&quot; the report said. Flaws in Safety Procedures</p> <p>The report, dated Sept. 9, also found flaws with worker safety protections. &quot;The plant respirator program has not met requirements of applicable D.O.E. orders or national standards,&quot; said the report. Further, while the civilian nuclear industry operates on a principle of radiation exposure called &quot;as low as reasonably achievable,&quot; and the Department of Energy has promised to do the same, the plant management at Rocky Flats &quot;diverged significantly&quot; from that philosophy,&quot; the report said.</p> <p>The department badly wants to restart the Rocky Flats plant to manufacture plutonium triggers for bombs on a new class of submarine-launched warheads for Trident 2 missiles.</p> <p>The House and Senate are now negotiating over the 1992 Defense Appropriations bill, in which Rocky Flats is a major issue. The Senate version contains an amendment that would bar the department from reopening Rocky Flats until a report is written on whether the warheads could be made by recycling triggers from older weapons.</p>
587915>Pondering an Energy Tax That Can&#39;t Please All the People THE energy tax being considered by the Clinton Administration could reduce the budget deficit, cut oil imports and meet environmental goals. But before the Administration asks Congress to approve one, it will have to decide which problems it wants cured the most, and whom it is willing to offend in the process. Last weekend the Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, said the Administration was considering a &quot;broad-based energy tax.&quot; Experts say that there are three practical ways to levy such a tax. First is the &quot;B.T.U.&quot; tax, in which each unit of energy, no matter what the source, would be taxed at the same rate; second is a sales tax on the fuel used by utilities, industries and individuals ; third is a &quot;carbon tax&quot; based on how much carbon dioxide the fuel&#39;s use creates. Other possibilities -- not so broad-based -- are taxes on oil imports and on gasoline.  <p>Each produces a different set of winners and losers, allies and enemies. The carbon tax, for example, would hit residents of the Midwest very hard, and the oil import tax would hurt the Northeast; both would be felt much more mildly in the Pacific Northwest.</p> <p>If any energy tax is enacted, consumers would pay more not just for the energy they buy directly, like gasoline or electricity. Everything has an energy component, from maple syrup, which is produced with prodigious amounts of oil, to a dentist&#39;s filling a cavity, which requires electricity for the drill. Indeed, most people pay more for energy through the goods and services they buy than they pay directly in utility or fuel bills. In that sense, a &quot;broad-based energy tax&quot; could resemble a national sales tax or a value-added tax.</p> <p>Picking which tax will emerge, if any, is difficult. A spokesman for the Treasury Department, Scott Dykema, said on Friday that &quot;nothing has been ruled in and nothing has been ruled out.&quot;</p> <p>But Roger Altman, deputy Treasury Secretary, said in an interview with John McLaughlin, host of the television program &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot;, on Friday that &quot;there are good arguments for a B.T.U. tax, and there are good arguments for an ad valorem tax.&quot; An ad valorem tax is a sales tax on energy.</p> <p>&quot;I think those two are the primary options in this area,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#39;t think that a gasoline tax is as attractive, I don&#39;t think that a carbon tax is as attractive, but whether the President will ultimately decide on an energy tax at all, and how he&#39;ll come down as between these two or some of the other options, I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p> <p>On Capitol Hill, key players have yet to take a position. Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, reiterated last week that he favors a gasoline tax, 25 cents a gallon or more, and has also said he would support other tax increases if the President wants them. But he has not been more detailed on the subject of energy taxes.</p> <p>Likewise, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has supported an energy tax but not expressed any preference thus far.</p> <p>Whatever tax is chosen, implementation would probably be complicated. And the tax would create a drag on the economy -- perhaps even a sudden burst of inflation. But such taxes are also extremely attractive as a way to raise money. The national energy bill is about $475 billion a year, nearly 10 percent of the gross domestic product. &quot;There&#39;s real money here,&quot; said Phillip K. Verleger Jr., an energy and commodity economist. If the Administration holds to its goal of cutting the deficit by $145 billion in four years, that implies major revenue growth even if there are also spending cuts.</p> <p>Some people in the energy industry say that energy should not be singled out for taxation. &quot;Good economics tells you you should raise revenue from the broadest source possible,&quot; said Bruce G. Humphrey, the chief economist at the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of investor-owned utilities. &quot;An energy tax literally excludes 90 percent of the rest of the economy.&quot; The result, he said, is distortions in the economy.</p> <p>But that is the idea, say proponents who want to change the way energy is used. However, such considerations may be secondary, especially in Mr. Bentsen&#39;s mind. The trial balloon for this tax was floated by the Treasury Secretary, not the Energy Secretary, Hazel Rollins O&#39;Leary, who told the Senate Energy Committee in her confirmation hearings a few days earlier that she did not favor energy taxes.</p> <p>Following is a description of the options: The &#39;B.T.U.&#39; Tax</p> <p>Fuel comes in many forms and when engineers compare them -- to decide, say, whether to run a factory on oil or natural gas -- they refer to the heat content as measured by B.T.U.&#39;s, or British thermal units.  Trivia buffs will recall that a B.T.U. is the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit at or near 39.2 degrees.</p> <p>Some people, including Mr. Altman, say that rather than taxing coal by the ton or oil by the barrel, which effectively means different taxes for different kinds of fuels, they should be taxed according to a common standard. Each B.T.U., no matter what fuel it came from, would be taxed at the same rate.</p> <p>Under this tax, the hardest hit would be coal, because its price per million B.T.U.&#39;s is the lowest, around $1.50, so on a percentage basis, any fixed tax would add to coal&#39;s cost the most. The price of a million B.T.U.&#39;s of natural gas varies by season but is generally around $2. The price of heavy oil, the kind most often in competition with gas and coal, varies sharply but recently has been around $2.50 per million B.T.U.&#39;s.</p> <p>By contrast, a B.T.U. tax would fall only lightly on the uranium used in nuclear power plants. Uranium, which is not priced by the B.T.U., in any case costs far less than fossil fuels. (Most of nuclear energy&#39;s costs come from capital and labor.)</p> <p>A B.T.U. tax could also be applied to energy from windmills and hydroelectric plants. Currently the Energy Department measures the electric output of those plants and calculates how many B.T.U.&#39;s would have been required to make that electricity from the average plant running on fossil fuels.</p> <p>&quot;A B.T.U. tax might be viewed as being regionally fairer&quot; than a carbon tax, which would hit some fuels more than others, said Roger Dower, an energy expert at the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington that advocates the use of taxes to achieve environmental goals. But Mr. Dower added that such a tax, while more politically palatable, is not aimed at the fuels that cause the most damage.</p> <p>Some analysts say the tax would drive some users to oil from coal, therefore increasing reliance on oil imports. Also, a B.T.U. tax would discourage the use of not just fossil fuels but all energy, including environmentally benign &quot;renewable&quot; sources like wind, geothermal energy or wood from tree farms.</p> <p>As measured in B.T.U.&#39;s, about 40 percent of the energy consumed in this country comes from oil, 24 percent from natural gas, 23 percent from coal, 8 percent from nuclear power and 4 percent from hydroelectricity. If the tax were levied by energy content, those fuels would bear it in those proportions.</p> <p>A variant of a B.T.U. tax would be a fixed tax on the price of all fuels -- say 5 percent. It would be just like a sales tax. This would exempt windmills, hydroelectric dams and geothermal energy, whose operators do not pay for fuel. Nuclear power would benefit, too, because uranium is very cheap, even if reactors are expensive.  The Carbon Tax</p> <p>Most environmentalists favor something more targeted: a tax on fuels in proportion to the amount of carbon dioxide their use creates. Carbon dioxide is implicated by scientists as the single most important gas in global warming. Among fossil fuels, natural gas produces the least carbon dioxide, oil is in the middle and coal produces the most. Hydroelectricity and nuclear power produce none; windmills, which are on the threshold of commercial success, and solar electric systems, which are a step behind wind, are also free of carbon dioxide. Vice President Gore, when he was a Senator, expressed support for a carbon tax.</p> <p>&quot;I think a carbon tax makes sense,&quot; said Dr. Harold M. Hubbard, now a fellow at the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, who wrote an article in Scientific American two years ago that environmentalists hail as a landmark in explaining why energy should be taxed. &quot;A carbon tax is probably the most politically acceptable and even-handed way,&quot; he said, pointing to the goals of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, moving to &quot;sustainable&quot; energy sources, and &quot;spreading the misery over a broader base.&quot;</p> <p>But some regions would suffer much more than others from a carbon tax. Almost 90 percent of the electricity in Ohio comes from coal. By contrast, about 90 percent of the electricity in Washington state is from hydroelectricity or nuclear power. That means the energy-intensive aluminum mills of the Pacific Northwest could continue almost unaffected by a carbon tax, while the farms and factories of the Midwest would face huge new costs.</p> <p>Mr. Humphrey of the Edison Electric Institute said hypothetically that a tax of $100 per ton of carbon emitted by burning fuel would raise the price of a ton of coal by 230 percent, of oil by 65 percent, and of natural gas by 90 percent.</p> <p>At most utility power plants a million B.T.U.&#39;s turns into about 105 kilowatt-hours of electricity. This implies an increase of about 2.4 cents per kilowatt-hour from coal-burning plants on a national average price of electricity of about 7.5 cents -- a big blow to customers.</p> <p>The tax would favor renewable energy sources and nuclear power over other sources. But John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said the main effect would be to make coal less competitive against gas. &quot;Most inter-fuels competition is in the electric sector, with coal and gas,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Proposing a carbon tax would also create an instant nexus of opposition, from the coal industry and coal-state members of Congress. Environmentalists and tax experts refer to Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who is the President Pro Tem of the Senate, as if he were a force of nature when they describe how difficult it would be to enact a tax over his opposition. The Oil-Import Fee</p> <p>Both a carbon tax and a B.T.U. tax would dampen demand for oil, but neither would do anything for domestic oil producers, which have lost nearly half a million jobs in 10 years and are now producing less oil than at any time since the early 1960&#39;s. The independent producers -- that is, those whose companies only produce oil, as opposed to refining or marketing it -- recently called for a fee of some kind on oil imports. Backed by some oil-patch members of Congress, this would amount to a more narrowly based energy tax.</p> <p>On Thursday, J. Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, said he would propose a floor price of $25 a barrel on oil imports. If the world price were lower, the Government would impose a tariff to effectively raise the price to $25.</p> <p>But the United States has ratified a free trade agreement with Canada, one of this country&#39;s largest sources of oil, and has signed, if not ratified, a similar agreement with Mexico, another major producer. Washington would also like to avoid destabilizing Venezuela, a big source of imports, or offending an ally, Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>An oil-import tax also has problems. For example, of the roughly 94 million housing units in this country, more than half, about 48 million, use natural gas, and only about 13 million use heating oil. Nearly all of those 13 million are in the Northeast.</p> <p>Alternatively, Washington could propose a tax only on gasoline, said Jeffrey C. Genzer, the lawyer for the National Association of State Energy Officials. That would raise the ire of people in the West, who typically drive longer distances, but it would also upset state officials, who would see that increase as pre-empting future increases in state gasoline taxes.</p> <p>In budget maneuvering last year, Congress shied away from a gasoline-tax increase of even 5 cents. Such a tax produces severe differences in impact by region and income. But in its favor, the price of gasoline is low now, which might make it more politically palatable.</p>
285793>Environment Dominates 91-Nation Energy Talks In a striking shift of focus, the 3,400 delegates gathered here from 91 countries to discuss the world energy picture have one dominant concern: the environment. Price and supply, the traditional focus of energy suppliers, have almost been squeezed off the agenda.  <p>The delegates represent some of the world&#39;s most prominent experts on oil, coal, natural gas, shale oil, hydroelectricity, nuclear power, photovoltaic power, solar thermal power and even peat moss. But in most of the 160 technical papers presented here, the dozens of panel discussions and the major addresses, the worry at this triennial event has shifted from oil embargoes and declining reserves of fossil fuels to urban smog, acid rain and, above all, global warming.</p> <p>The question, clearly, is no longer where the fuel will come from - one study released here noted a 30 percent increase in estimated oil reserves in the last three years - but how to use it safely.</p> <p>The producers have cause for worry. Industrial emissions of carbon dioxide, which scientists believe must be limited to slow global warming, could be 70 percent higher than current levels by 2020, assuming moderate economic growth, according to a major study released today by the World Energy Conference. Changes in the Atmosphere</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It is unambiguous and beyond doubt that we are changing the composition of the atmosphere by a measurable and important amount,&#39;&#39; said Lord Marshall of Goring, chairman of Britain&#39;s Central Electric Generating Board,&#39;&#39; in a keynote address. The program includes an outline for a panel discussion on global warming, listing topics for discussion, but begins by saying, &#39;&#39;The existence of a greenhouse effect is not to be debated.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>For such a huge group of energy suppliers to put price, supply and production technology in second place is surprising, many of those present said. John Wakeham, Britain&#39;s Secretary of State for Energy, contrasted the concern now with the belief by Western nations in the 1970&#39;s that oil and other fuels were dwindling. That, he said, &#39;&#39;has been revealed as a gloomy fantasy and one of the most spectacularly mistaken forecasts of recent history.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But even after the oil glut of 1986 drowned the talk of shortage, the talk did not shift to the environment. &#39;&#39;You would never have heard this three years ago,&#39;&#39; said Elihu Bergman, executive director of Americans for Energy Independence, a conservation organization based in Washington. &#39;&#39;This conference is symbolically legitimizing what we have known in the States: environmental policy is driving energy policy.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A speech by Lee M. Thomas, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, reinforced the point. Mr. Thomas detailed decisions ranging from handling of the wastes from oil drilling to requiring anti-pollution equipment on power plants that cast his agency in the role of making energy policy. In another speech, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made a similar point. &#39;&#39;Environmental sensitivity and economic growth, fueled by energy, go hand in hand,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We no longer have the luxury of trying to have one without the other.&#39;&#39; Growth in Energy Use</p> <p>The carbon dioxide study, assembled by 30 experts from 18 countries and 9 international organizations, assumed only a small increase in each person&#39;s energy use over the period, but a near-doubling of the population in the third world, from 3.6 billion in 1985 to 6.3 billion in 2020.</p> <p>The conference also released a separate study hinting that the reserves of fossil fuels are plentiful. A triennial study of resources found that global recoverable reserves of hard coal are up 80 percent since 1986, oil reserves are up 30 percent and natural gas is up 14 percent.</p> <p>What was less clear than supply was where energy policy was being driven. Lord Marshall&#39;s prescription was nuclear power, a view that did not create a clear consensus here. Another conflict was between delegates from the third world and the developed countries over who would have to improve energy efficiency to minimize releases of carbon dioxide and other gases.</p> <p>Chauncey Starr, the founder and former president of the Electric Power Research Institute of Palo Alto, Calif., pointed out that each North American uses, on average, seven times as much energy as people of the third world. For &#39;&#39;a huge portion of the world population,&#39;&#39; he said, the primary concerns are &#39;&#39;food supply and enough fuel for cooking and warmth.&#39;&#39; If that population increases its energy consumption only modestly - 2.3 percent a year, Mr. Starr said - the combination of population growth and higher consumption would quadruple world energy demand in 75 years.</p> <p>Mr. Starr and others suggested investing in efficiency, especially in the third world; for example, Mr. Starr said, the efficiency of cooking over an open stove is 3 percent, versus 20 percent in a clay oven, a percentage increase far greater than that available in the industrial world.</p> <p>But that focus may be wrong, said another delegate, Jassim al-Gumer, director of the economics department at the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Counties, in Kuwait. &#39;&#39;They have such little to spend on pollution, or energy,&#39;&#39; he said of the nonindustrial countries. India, he said, uses a barrel of oil a year for each person, Brazil 3 and the United States 45. &#39;&#39;How much pollution is coming from the 45 barrels versus the one barrel?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>For the developing countries that aspire to use more energy, limits on use to slow global warming seem unfair. &#39;&#39;Industrialized countries should recognize that they are to carry the lion&#39;s share of the total burden because they consume 80 percent of world energy resources,&#39;&#39; said Bong Suh Lee, the South Korean Minister of Energy Resources.</p> <p>More than unfair, it may be impossible, said the British Secretary of State for Energy, John Wakeham. In any international agreement to cut emissions from burning fossil fuels, he said, &#39;&#39;We have to recognize that some backs are broader than others; that costs that are an inconvenience in the developed countries may make the difference between life and death in the third world.&#39;&#39; Allocating the Burden</p> <p>But allocating the burden, experts said here, would be difficult. Speaking for the United States, W. Henson Moore, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, sounded distinctly unwilling to take too large a role, or to take substantial action before everyone else agreed. &#39;&#39;The good done by one country is offset by the increased damage done by another,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>But the United States and the rest of the world would feel a substantial effect from third-world energy growth, according to the study on energy growth, &#39;&#39;Global Energy Perspectives 2000-2020.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Whether the level of carbon dioxide output represents an unrealistic constraint on the scenario painted by the study was not clear to the participants. Klaus Brendow, the director of the energy commission of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, noted that the scenario assumed that fossil fuels would provide about 80 percent of energy in 2020, down from 88 percent in 1985. &#39;&#39;The risks of a global warming resulting from such a bias are obvious,&#39;&#39; he said, calling for more research into renewable energy.</p> <p>The scenario established in the study predicted that with moderate economic growth, third world use of coal would triple between 1985 and 2020; use of oil would double, and use of natural gas would more than triple. Worldwide, the study said, coal use would be up by 51 percent, oil by 66 percent and natural gas by 58 percent.</p> <p>It also assumed that the use of nuclear power would more than triple, to account for 7 or 8 percent of energy supplies, compared with 4 now. An estimate by the organization in 1983 had put nuclear at 12 percent by 2020, but it was scaled back because construction has dropped off.</p>
796659>It&#39;s Amtrak Against Everyone on the Road DECLINING budgets make for shifting alliances. But would you believe the Highway Users Federation siding with the American Public Transit Association? Against Amtrak?  <p>Amtrak needs money, which is setting off a philosophical debate over subsidies by one mode of transportation to another, and by people of one economic class to another. And the rail line&#39;s quest for money has made the highway lobby -- oil companies, car manufacturers, construction interests and others -- a little nervous.</p> <p>Since it was created in 1971, Amtrak has received over $13 billion, including nearly $1 billion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. The railroad now covers 81 percent of its operating costs from revenues, up from 48 percent in 1981. But Congress wants to eliminate subsidies soon.</p> <p>Amtrak believes it could run without operating subsidies, if it had the capital for newer trains and better tracks. So it set its sights on a permanent source, a half cent of the 18-cent-a-gallon Federal gasoline tax.  Congress&#39;s Nickel</p> <p>The half penny is part of a five-cent increase that Congress put into effect in 1990. Beginning this fiscal year, 2 1/2 cents was supposed to go to the Highway Trust Fund, with half a cent going to the fund&#39;s mass-transit account.</p> <p>It is a scrap, as taxes go, bringing about $2.50 a year from the average car. But the total comes to about $600 million.</p> <p>The Senate Commerce Committee approved the idea of earmarking the money for Amtrak. But in the House, the chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Bud Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania, is not warm to the idea.</p> <p>&quot;Taking money out of the highway trust fund for Amtrak violates a basic commitment that we made, the first contract with America,&quot; he said. &quot;It was between Dwight Eisenhower and the Congress, and it was, you pay your gasoline tax and we&#39;ll use that money to improve the nation&#39;s highways and bridges.&quot;</p> <p>Amtrak&#39;s proposal also set off the public-transit lobby, its former ally, which is determined to keep what it has managed to siphon from the fund. &quot;The half penny belongs to mass transit,&quot; said Jack R. Gilstrap, executive vice president of the American Public Transit Association. &quot;Both Amtrak and the nation&#39;s transit providers are woefully short. Does weakening Peter to strengthen Paul help the traveling public?&quot;</p> <p>The road lobby is siding with the transit systems. Healthy bus and rail systems around cities reduce congestion far more than Amtrak does, says William D. Fay, president of the Highway Users Federation.</p> <p>But what really worries Mr. Fay more than the half cent is that the Senate bill would let the states use highway money from Washington to help finance Amtrak.</p> <p>And the states like Amtrak. When its board voted in April to cut about 22 percent of the system&#39;s miles, eight states stepped up with money to avert cuts. In all, states pay Amtrak about $70 million a year.</p> <p>The road lobby also says this results in poor people with cars helping pay for richer people who ride trains. &quot;It&#39;s a middle-class subsidy,&quot; said Charles J. DiBona, the president of the American Petroleum Institute.</p> <p>But rail riders have subsidized others before, according to Philip M. Martin, an aviation consultant with Gellman Research Associates, of Jenkintown, Pa., and a former operations analyst at Conrail. The railroads had a trust fund, like the airlines and the highways, he said, but it was folded into the general fund in 1962. At that time, he said, &quot;neither the air trust fund nor the highway trust funds were self-sufficient; they were still taking money from the general fund to pay for projects.&quot;</p> <p>At a news conference where Amtrak made its pitch for the half cent, the Mayor of Meridian, Miss., John Robert Smith, extolled the city&#39;s new center where buses, taxis, airport limousines and trains all come together. &quot;These modes should feed each other, not feed on each other,&quot; he said.</p> <p>In principle, all parties agree.  THE NATION</p>
1483858>Inquiry Focuses on Skeletons of Space Shuttles When the space shuttle Columbia first flew, 22 years ago this month, much attention was paid to its skin, which was made of a new type of heat-resistant tile. Few people focused on its skeleton, made of a much more familiar material -- lightweight, inexpensive aluminum. Now, in hindsight, investigators are postulating whether the aluminum played a central role in Columbia&#39;s destruction. When the shuttle&#39;s thermal protection system began to fail, the aluminum skeleton was unforgiving. It not only melted, but burned.  <p>Harold W. Gehman Jr., the retired admiral who is chairman of the independent commission investigating the disaster, points out that aluminum is also used as an ingredient of explosives.</p> <p>Admiral Gehman has said repeatedly that his panel&#39;s report should form the basis for discussions about future space travel. The panel has questioned witnesses carefully about materials available for NASA&#39;s use, and while it is unlikely to make specific suggestions, it could recommend considering new materials.</p> <p>In the late 1970&#39;s, designers of the shuttle fleet chose aluminum because it was strong, light, cheap and easy to work with. Its flammability was known, but designers believed the thermal protection system would do its job.</p> <p>It would not be possible to replace the aluminum in existing shuttles, but if engineers were starting work on a new vehicle, what could replace aluminum? A likely candidate is titanium, which is used in supersonic fighter planes and is familiar to consumers as a component of golf clubs and laptop cases. Titanium will burn, but it is very difficult to ignite large pieces.</p> <p>Titanium is about 70 percent heavier than aluminum. But it is also stronger, so thinner pieces can do the same work. Over all, a titanium frame would weigh less, said Dr. Thomas Vasilos, a professor at the University of Massachusetts, who helped develop the heat protection systems in Peacekeeper and Minuteman missiles.</p> <p>Titanium is also more expensive -- at least $4 a pound, compared with 40 cents for aluminum. But shuttles are not mass-produced, and some engineers say the cost difference is of small consequence. &#39;&#39;If you&#39;re only building four of them, in hindsight, it makes sense,&#39;&#39; said William D. Waldock, a professor of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.</p> <p>Mr. Waldock pointed to a different problem: titanium is physically so hard that it is difficult to work with. It is harder to cut, mill or drill through.</p> <p>But with all of that said, experts are still divided on whether a shift to titanium makes sense. Paul A. Czysz, a professor emeritus at Parks College of Engineering and Aviation at St. Louis University and a veteran of 39 years at McDonnell-Douglas, where he specialized in the design of high-temperature components for aircraft and space vehicles, said he doubted it.</p> <p>The fundamental problem, he said, is the shuttle&#39;s thermal protection system, which relies on those heat-shedding tiles. The shuttle, he said, has 20,000 tiles with hardly any two alike, and a complicated procedure for replacing them. If that system fails, titanium may in fact perform better than aluminum, he said, but added, &#39;&#39;What you&#39;re talking about is the difference between 5 seconds to destruction and 10 seconds to destruction.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Engineers&#39; efforts would be better spent, he said, on developing a thermal protection system that was less fragile and had mass-produced, interchangeable parts that could be replaced by an astronaut.</p> <p>Aerospace engineers cannot always compensate for parts failure simply by using stronger materials, he argued. &#39;&#39;Tires blow out if they are made improperly,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We don&#39;t say, &#39;Let&#39;s replace them with steel tires.&#39; &#39;&#39;</p> <p>Nor is there much prospect of building a new shuttle fleet from radically different materials that may perform far better than aluminum or titanium. That is not an option, experts say, because those materials do not exist.</p> <p>NASA once spurred the creation of many new materials, including Teflon and Velcro, but federal spending on research to make such materials has slowed considerably in the years since the shuttle was designed. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s so much competition for that research dollar,&#39;&#39; said Professor Vasilos, &#39;&#39;from biomaterials, nanotechnology, electronics and communications material rather than real aerospace science.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>At a hearing conducted on April 8 by the independent commission investigating the disaster, Richard D. Blomberg, the former chairman of NASA&#39;s outside panel of safety advisers, said there was no reason to start work now on a next-generation space vehicle because better materials were not at hand. Surveying what is available today, he said, &#39;&#39;We didn&#39;t see anything out there that was notably better than what was in the shuttle.&#39;&#39;</p>
2310>HEART PUMP TO RECEIVE WIDER USE Surgeons at Beth Israel Hospital here will soon begin implanting partial artificial hearts in heart attack victims as a temporary device to help them withstand shock.  <p>The experimental program will use left ventricular assist devices, which have already been employed here and elsewhere as stop-gaps to help patients who have undergone heart surgery or who need heart transplants.</p> <p>Their use is highly unusual in heart attack victims, who are more numerous, and generally healthier, than those who are awaiting transplant or have undergone surgery. As a result, the device may have wide applications.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s for the patient who comes into the emergency ward, one hour into a heart attack,&#39;&#39; said Dr. William Grossman, chief of the cardiovascular division at Beth Israel and a professor of medicine at Harvard. &#39;&#39;His blood pressure has rapidly fallen, and he&#39;s had cardiac arrest. The patient has had a lot of heart muscle that&#39;s not irreversibly damaged, and if we can get the patient supported for a week to 10 days, he will survive.&#39;&#39; Avoiding Clots</p> <p>The pump can take over virtually all of the pumping effort, according to Dr. William F. Bernhard, a consultant in cardiovascular surgery who has been working on its development for more than a decade. Dr. Berhnard said that it overcomes the clotting problem that often accomanies use of artificial hearts. The device uses textured titanium, which becomes coated with blood cells and forms a natural surface, he said. As a result, he said, patients do not need anti-coagulants that can cause excessive bleeding.</p> <p>The Food and Drug Administration gave him permission to implant seven such pumps. Each will be used on an emergency basis.</p> <p>The pump, about 4 inches in diameter, is made by Thermedics, Inc., of Woburn, Mass., a subsidiary of Thermo Electron Corporation.</p> <p>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, paid some of the development costs.</p>
556896>California&#39;s Pied Piper of Clean Air The Clean Air Act may have been written in Washington, but the nation&#39;s most influential regulatory body is here. Anything in this country with a tailpipe, smokestack or vent is likely to be regulated eventually with rules first worked out by the California Air Resources Board. The board lays down the toughest regulations, forces the biggest changes and generally blazes the path for everyone else, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency. That is particularly true when it comes to cars and trucks and the fuel to run them. Now the board and its determined chairwoman of the last seven years, Jananne Sharpless, are pushing hard for the biggest change of all, the Low-Emission Vehicle Program, which prescribes successive generations of ever-cleaner cars, ending with vehicles that emit no pollution. But success is catching up with the agency, which is known by its acronym, CARB.  <p>Imitation by other states is, of course, a form of flattery. But since the Low-Emission Vehicle Program was approved here two years ago -- with implementation set to start with the 1994 model year -- it has made CARB a bigger target. The program leaves the auto and oil industries facing unprecedented challenges that they say will cost billions of dollars in California alone -- and many billions more in other states that plan to follow CARB&#39;s lead. So they are now moving to stop the program, in a way that threatens a pattern of regulation established more than 20 years ago.</p> <p>That pattern began in 1970, when Congress passed the first Clean Air Act. The act blocked the other 49 states from acting independently in areas regulated by the Federal Government, including cars. But CARB, formed two years earlier by the merger of several predecessor agencies, was given an out. To deal with California&#39;s air, the nation&#39;s dirtiest, the state was told it could continue to write its own rules. The one caveat: it had to apply to the E.P.A. for waivers before it could enforce them. To date, approval has been close to perfunctory, permitting programs that led to the introduction of such now-common features of life as catalytic converters and no-lead gasoline, requirements later applied nationally by the E.P.A.</p> <p>Now, for the first time, Detroit is engaged in a serious effort to block a waiver. And several big energy companies, including Texaco and Mobil, have joined in with advertising and lobbying. Half the Market in Tow</p> <p>California represents about a tenth of the nation&#39;s car market. But New York and Massachusetts have already adopted the Low-Emission Vehicle Program, and all the other states from Virginia to Maine have promised to do the same. Some may fall by the wayside, but Texas, Illinois and Colorado could join in.</p> <p>At stake, in theory, is the whole program. Under the most recent set of amendments to the Clean Air Act, other states can &quot;opt in&quot; to California&#39;s program, but if California does not get its waiver there would be nothing to opt into. Another possibility is that Washington would approve a watered-down version. In either case, CARB&#39;s role as an accidental Pied Piper to an area stretching from Boston to Buffalo and Bangor to Baltimore, with close to half the nation&#39;s car market in tow, is coming back to haunt it, Ms. Sharpless thinks.</p> <p>&quot;As a result of other states&#39; deciding to opt in, it&#39;s becoming more politically problematic for California to get its waivers,&quot; said Ms. Sharpless. &quot;Not because California hasn&#39;t designed its program well, not because we don&#39;t have a very strong case to have such an air quality program, not because we&#39;ve designed a program that is technically not feasible.&quot; Instead, she said, &quot;It&#39;s because of the implications that it has for the car companies by going to other states.&quot;</p> <p>But the oil and auto industries, represented most prominently by Texaco and General Motors, deny such a complicated motive. They say that the stringent new rules are not suited to conditions outside California and are far from the most effective use of anti-pollution dollars. Indeed, they say, the program which could require cars running on such unfamiliar fuels as methanol, natural gas and electricity, may not be feasible at any price.  Samuel A. Leonard, director of automotive emissions control at G.M., acknowledged that more than California is now at stake, and &quot;anything that&#39;s going to increase my risk by an order of magnitude is going to have an impact on how hard I fight.&quot; &#39;I Won&#39;t Survive&#39;</p> <p>&quot;As a company I might survive having to recall every car I build in California, for failing to meet emission requirements,&quot; Mr. Leonard said. But if cars throughout the nation have to meet the California standard, and they cannot be built to meet the program&#39;s specifications, &quot;I won&#39;t survive that, period,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Texaco is a relatively small player in the California gasoline market but a bigger factor in the Eastern states that want to follow California&#39;s lead.  Texaco denies that it is fighting the rules in the West to keep them out of the East. William K. Tell Jr., who is in charge of governmental relations at the company, said that the rules will hurt California, and the state is promoting their export because of their high cost. &quot;They have been quite active in proselytizing, sending the staff around to other states,&quot; he said. But if everyone picks up the burden, which Texaco maintains will be staggering, California will not be at a relative disadvantage, he said.</p> <p>Not all companies dislike CARB. ARCO, the biggest gasoline marketer in California and the owner of an advanced refinery, favors stricter gasoline standards. And some manufacturers see new markets for their products as CARB continues to order companies to invent solutions to the pollution problem, something that Washington regulators seldom do. Tomorrow, for example, CARB plans to announce that it has certified a natural-gas engine produced by the Cummins Engine Company for use in California, a step that will help Cummins build a new market.</p> <p>But most oil and auto companies hope the program is derailed. David Hawkins, who was the assistant administrator for air, noise and radiation at the E.P.A. in the Carter Administration and is now a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, has another explanation for the opposition. It is &quot;a time-buying operation,&quot; he said, because it delays the program everywhere. But in the long term, he said, &quot;They have the hope of turning California into an ally&quot; in trying to repeal the right of other states to opt in.</p> <p>&quot;In effect, it holds the breathers in California hostage,&quot; he said.  A Tradition of Power</p> <p>For whatever reason, the frustration is a change for CARB, which has pretty much had its own way and has been what the E.P.A. would probably like to be: tough, wellfunded and backed by a strong political consensus for cleaner air. It has tackled everything from gasoline to hair spray, and is preparing to take on lawnmowers and bulldozers. It regularly exercises a level of authority that Federal regulators have largely been without since the beginning of the Reagan years.</p> <p>&quot;CARB&#39;s mobile source program is more competently staffed than E.P.A.&#39;s,&quot; said Thomas Jorling, the environmental commissioner in New York, referring to the program to control emissions from tailpipes in cars, trucks and other vehicles. Mr. Jorling played a key role in forging the agreement among the Northeast states, in October 1991, to adopt the California program.</p> <p>For industry this can be a nightmare. &quot;There&#39;s no question they have been much more aggressive,&quot; said Mr. Tell of Texaco. &quot;They have much more in the way of staff resources and budget than other agencies.&quot; And, he added, &quot;they have obviously been operating in a political environment where there is a strong support for environmental programs.&quot;</p> <p>CARB is even the envy of some other California governmental agencies, because its $103 million budget comes not from the state&#39;s general fund but from &quot;user fees,&quot; everything from permits paid by polluters to the $6 each car owner pays for a smog-check certificate. So when the rest of the state&#39;s workers were paid with i.o.u.&#39;s for two months earlier this summer, CARB&#39;s staff of 873 got their checks as usual. The arrangement also insulates the agency from legislative pressure.</p> <p>The board has a newly remodeled building here, complete with bicycle lockers in the parking lot. It also has a laboratory in El Monte, Calif., that works like the one operated by the E.P.A., only to tougher standards, evaluating emissions on new engines before they can be used in cars sold in California. It sends inspectors to Tokyo and Stuttgart to monitor the testing of foreign-built cars. And it oversees a system of air quality management districts that issue and enforce their own regulations.</p> <p>&quot;We have borrowed from E.P.A. where their methods work,&quot; said Michael W. Poore, chief of the laboratory here, &quot;but in some cases, their methods don&#39;t work.&quot;</p> <p>Not that CARB walks on water; officials at the E.P.A. say that its program for inspecting cars already on the road lags other states. But Washington clearly values California&#39;s role as a laboratory for technology and policy.  Eclipsed by Sacramento</p> <p>Even considering that history, the move by the Northeast states represents an extraordinary shift of power from Washington, where regulators are often paralyzed by conflicting commercial interests. Under the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, any state that does not meet Federal clean air standards -- which is to say, any urban state -- can hand its proxy to CARB and take whatever medicine the board prescribes for California, as if switching its allegiance to a new government. There is a catch: the states that &quot;opt in&quot; to the California program and adopt it as their own must take it lock, stock and barrel, a provision added to the amendments by the lobbying of the auto companies, who feared 50 different standards. The object was not to make CARB more powerful, but that may have been the effect.</p> <p>The Low-Emission Vehicle Program prescribes successively cleaner generations of cars, filling larger and larger fractions of each manufacturer&#39;s sales. Some of those cars will probably run on new fuels; all will carry equipment that has yet to be perfected, and some will run on gasoline that has never been mass-produced.</p> <p>The feasibility of the program is a matter of dispute, with CARB pointing out that some small cars have already been modified to meet the first stage, called &quot;transitional low-emission vehicles,&quot; at hardly any cost. At the other extreme is the &quot;zero emission vehicle,&quot; presumably an electric car that the auto makers must invent, perfect and then persuade consumers to buy. In between are the cars that will probably run on unfamiliar fuels.</p> <p>The E.P.A. held a hearing on the proposed waiver this spring, accepted public comments and moved toward a decision. But in late July it re-opened the record for more comments; backers of the CARB program say Vice President Dan Quayle&#39;s competitiveness council was responsible for that decision. But Richard D. Wilson, director of the E.P.A.&#39;s office of mobile sources, said the E.P.A. itself had been responsible.</p> <p>The issue at hand is the technical feasibility of the standards, but some supporters of the program are derisive on that point. The E.P.A., saidMr. Jorling, no longer has the technical capability to do the analysis.</p> <p>But the E.P.A. says that so far there has been no special delay on issuing a waiver. Mr. Wilson said that in the past, unless California has &quot;made a decision that is so strange that it doesn&#39;t pass the laugh test, we&#39;ve tended to approve it.&quot; But many waiver requests never reach the stage of public hearing, he said, while this one has attracted a record number of comments, which the staff is still wading through.</p> <p>Opponents say that a program designed for California is not right for anywhere else. In July, Mobil placed advertisements in national newspapers headlined &quot;California Dreaming?&quot; It quoted James D. Boyd, CARB&#39;s staff chief, as saying, &quot;problems can arise . . . when other states adopt our programs. Our regulations are designed to protect air quality under conditions that occur in California, and may not always be suitable for other areas.&quot; CARB maintains that Mr. Boyd was quoted out of context, and that its regulations may indeed be suitable for other states.</p> <p>California&#39;s problems are, in fact, different. For one thing, its highways teem with car species that are now nearly extinct in the East: Cadillacs with fins, DeSotos and even old Fords with the bumper sticker: &quot;Caution, Unexploded Pinto.&quot; Nearly one-third of the cars pre-date 1979, which means they are filthy by modern standards. The old cars account for only about a fifth of the miles driven in the state but nearly 60 percent of the hydrocarbons and about half the carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, according to CARB.</p> <p>But the environmental chiefs of the Eastern states say that meeting the requirements of the Clean Air Act will require every tool available.</p> <p>As it awaits Washington&#39;s verdict in the next few months, CARB, apparently unbowed, is continuing to invent the future. Among other things, it is adopting specifications for new fuels, like methanol and compressed natural gas, and is moving rapidly toward controlling such off-road pollution sources as lawnmowers and construction equipment.</p> <p>And the agency is still acting like a Pied Piper, not only to the nation but to the world: Ms. Sharpless leaves this week to chair a panel discussion on air pollution in Madrid.</p> <p>THE NORTHEAST SCORECARD</p> <p>The fight in the East over the Low-Emission Vehicle Program is a little like a battle to approve a constitutional amendment -- a state-by-state campaign in which the two sides disagree about the prospects. But if enough states in a region approve the plan, experts predict that pressure will grow, especially from car dealers, for others to follow. Dealers commonly swap inventory to satisfy customer demand, but they would be unable to swap across state lines if state standards differed.</p> <p>In the region running from Virginia through Maine, cabinet-level environmental officials have all endorsed the program. New York and Massachusetts have already adopted it, but a legislative committee voted down adoptionin Maryland last year, and a proposal in the Virginia legislature to adopt was amended into a study bill instead. Those states will face the issue again in the coming year.</p> <p>Not every state needs legislative action. In Maine and New Jersey, officials have formally proposed the regulations and have held hearings and accepted public comments. Acceptance is likely in coming weeks in both states, according to Michael Bradley, the executive director of the Northeast States Coalition for Air Use Management, an association of state environmental agencies.</p> <p>Connecticut passed legislation last year authorizing the state to adopt the program any time after 1995, Mr. Bradley said; he said the state would probably come on board in the 1998 model year. Legislation was unsuccessful last year in Vermont, but backers will try again this year, as they will in New Hampshire and Rhode Island.</p> <p>Delaware, Virginia and Pennsylvania have the matter under study, Mr. Bradley said, and the question is &quot;on hold&quot; in the District of Columbia. THE BOSS AT CARB</p> <p>The California Air Resources Board has nine members, but only one is full-time, its chairwoman, Jananne Sharpless. Appointed in 1985 by Gov. George Deukmejian, she also served as Secretary of Environmental Affairs in that administration. Gov. Pete Wilson reappointed her as chairwoman last February.</p> <p>A former consultant to the California Assembly&#39;s Ways and Means Committee, Ms. Sharpless received a political science degree from the University of California, Davis, in 1967.</p> <p>Allies and opponents say that she shows an unusually strong grasp of the details of proposals before the board. She can also be biting. At a hearing this spring on the Low-Emission Vehicle Program, auto industry representatives complained about meeting emission standards on the board&#39;s schedule. &quot;Car companies ought to hire fewer lawyers and more engineers,&quot; she responded.</p> <p>But there are some arguments she stays away from. Asked in an interview about sharp opposition from Texaco, she said, &quot;Every oil company has its own unique personality, and each of them are deserving of note.&quot;</p> <p>She is sensitive, however, to the suggestion that the board, in expanding its regulations to cover more and more areas of life, is overreaching.</p> <p>&quot;I think it is the outgrowth of our civilization, that we have come to a place in life where everything we do has an impact on our environment,&quot; she said. &quot;It is not regulation that is growing, but our awareness that the things we have taken for granted do have an impact on our well-being.&quot;</p> <p>She practices what she preaches, driving a Ford LTD that runs on methanol. &quot;It&#39;s been through several fuel pumps and spark plugs, but it&#39;s never stranded me by the side of the road, unlike some conventional cars I&#39;ve had,&quot; she said.</p>
687933>First Conviction Under Ozone-Protection Law The owner of a car-repair shop in St. Louis who admitted letting the refrigerant from a car&#39;s air-conditioner leak into the air has become the first person prosecuted under a Federal law intended to protect the atmosphere&#39;s ozone layer by tightly regulating such chemicals. The United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, Edward L. Dowd Jr., described it as a landmark air-pollution case.  <p>The shop owner, George Hofele of Chesterfield, Mo., faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, but Mr. Dowd agreed to recommend smaller penalties in exchange for Mr. Hofele&#39;s guilty plea.</p> <p>Mr. Hofele, 52, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to draining an automotive air-conditioner without the proper training or equipment. The authorities were tipped that Mr. Hofele engaged in the practice by a former employee of the shop, G&amp; H Tire and Auto of Marlborough, in St. Louis County. They sent a state highway patrol officer to investigate. Unmarked Police Car</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the United States Attorney&#39;s Office, Christy Marshall, said that the car was unmarked and that Mr. Hofele &quot;went ahead and serviced it in an improper manner.&quot;</p> <p>Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, shops that service automotive air-conditioners were supposed to install equipment by January 1992 that sucks the refrigerant, a chlorofluorocarbon, from the air-conditioners and purifies it for re-use. But the equipment costs $2,000 to $3,000, and technicians must be trained to use it. Some gas stations have given up servicing automotive air-conditioners as a result. Mr. Hofele did not have the equipment or the certified workers.</p> <p>Equipment designed for C.F.C.&#39;s will only be useful for a few years, because production of that type of refrigerant, often referred to by its Du Pont Company trade name Freon, is being phased out; new cars use a different material. Still, many gas stations have tooled up for the work.</p> <p>&quot;Hundreds of other businesses in the St. Louis area that work on vehicle air-conditioners have invested in the proper equipment,&quot; Missouri&#39;s Attorney General, Jay Nixon, said in a statement. &quot;They complied with a law Mr. Hofele apparently felt did not apply to him, and so he tried to cut corners.&quot; Up to 60 Cars Serviced</p> <p>An examination the shop&#39;s records showed that between January 1992, when the regulations took effect, and July 1993, when he was caught, Mr. Hofele may have serviced 60 car air-conditioners.</p> <p>Automotive air-conditioning systems routinely leak their refrigerant, but until the Federal Government heeded scientists&#39; warnings that chlorofluorocarbons were destroying the earth&#39;s ozone layer, refilling a system cost only a few dollars. If a system stopped working, the standard procedure was to drain the chemical, which is a liquid or a gas, depending on temperature and pressure, fix the problem and refill the air-conditioner. The new procedure is more costly to motorists because of the shop equipment involved.</p> <p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, until the new regulations were put in place, about 30 percent of chlorofluorocarbon emissions were from repair shops. Now, said a spokeswoman for the agency in Washington, Wendy Butler, &quot;the compliance rate is really quite high.&quot;  Asking Public&#39;s Help</p> <p>Neither the E.P.A. nor the law-enforcement agencies involved in the St. Louis case have a regular program of looking for violators.</p> <p>&quot;I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re having a crackdown on gas stations,&quot; said Ms. Marshall. But Mr. Dowd, the United States Attorney, and others involved in the case appealed to the public to alert them to cases of improper air-conditioner servicing.</p>
1374044>Deadline for Bomb Screening Will Not Be Met The Transportation Department said today that it would not meet the Dec. 31 deadline Congress had set for screening all baggage checked at the nation&#39;s airports with costly explosive detection systems. Instead, Norman Y. Mineta, the secretary of transportation, said the agency would use the machines in combination with trace detection systems, which are already familiar to travelers who carry hand luggage, and manually operated scanners.  <p>The decision may set off a struggle with Congress, where some leaders are eager to preserve the original requirements of the security bill.</p> <p>Mr. Mineta said that meeting Congress&#39;s preference was not practical. Only two companies now produce the explosives detection system machines and, he said, they lacked &#39;&#39;the capacity to be able to provide all the machines we need.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Experts say that about 2,200 machines, known as E.D.S. machines, are required. The machines are as big as a minivan and considerably heavier; they sometimes require rebuilding sections of airports to install, and some cost more than $1 million each.</p> <p>Mr. Mineta said that department officials were meeting with companies that could produce components or entire machines under license. Another possibility, he said, was to build machines that would scan bags and display the results to a human operator.</p> <p>The E.D.S. machines use a computer to scan the bag, because of concerns that a human operator might miss signs of a bomb. But Mr. Mineta said that  the agency would hire and train better screeners and will supervise them better.</p> <p>The department is supposed to report to Congress on its &#39;&#39;deployment plan&#39;&#39; on May 18, and may find part of its plan a hard sell.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We want them to meet this deadline,&#39;&#39; said a senior Senate staff member. The law gives the department an alternative to the 100 percent E.D.S. plan, but is intended only as an interim alternative.</p> <p>The trace detection systems are in common use now at checkpoints where guards inspect hand-carried items. A screener runs a cloth pad over the exterior of the item and puts it in an analyzer, which looks for signs of explosives.</p> <p>The two E.D.S. machine manufacturers are InVision Technologies of Newark, Calif., and L-3 Communications of New York. When the airlines ran security, they did not like either machine, especially the L-3 model because, they said, it often broke down. The company said the problem was fixed.</p> <p>A NATION CHALLENGED: AIRPORT SECURITY</p>
263063>Energy Chief Says Top Aides Lack Skills to Run U.S. Bomb Complex Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said today that managers and supervisors in his department lacked technical skills needed to run the bomb production system and were presenting him with unreliable information on problems at the plants. Some, he said, lacked the discipline needed for safe operation of nuclear reactors.  <p>Announcing a 10-point plan to improve operations in the department, Mr. Watkins said what he called &#39;&#39;tiger teams&#39;&#39; of auditors would look at two other bomb production plants for violations of environmental laws like those said to have occurred at the Rocky Flats plant near Denver. Scores of Federal agents are investigating whether the workers in Colorado secretly dumped and burned radioactive and chemical wastes.</p> <p>He also said that awards to the contractors who run the plants would be based primarily on environmental performance, not production quotas. The plan includes a public hot line for people to alert the department to problems. Unusually Blunt Language</p> <p>In his most comprehensive comments yet on the nation&#39;s nuclear weapons industry, Mr. Watkins acknowledged, as his predecessor had, that the plants were in disrepair. But he dwelled heavily on the disarray within his department in language that was unusually blunt for a Cabinet secretary.</p> <p>Alternating frustration with contrition, Mr. Watkins said, &#39;&#39;I am certainly not proud or pleased with what I have seen over my first few months in office.&#39;&#39; Referring to a production system whose major parts are at least 25 years old, some dating from the development of the atomic bomb, Mr. Watkins said, &#39;&#39;The chickens have finally come home to roost, and years of inattention to changing standards and demands regarding to the environment, safety and health are vividly exposed to public examination, in fact, almost daily.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Watkins, a retired admiral, said he would like to bring credibility to the department so that when it sought to open a new plant or operate an old one, the public would not feel the department was &#39;&#39;jamming something down somebody&#39;s throat out there.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But he said his efforts had been slowed because of an insufficient number of technically qualified people on the department&#39;s staff. And he said he was involving himself in every major decision because of unreliably optimistic information he was receiving.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;When I get the briefing, I only get one side, so I have to dig in myself,&#39;&#39; Mr. Watkins said. &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t have the data base coming to me that I need. I have omissions in the data base. So I am making decisions today on a crisis basis, and I don&#39;t like that. That&#39;s not my way of doing business.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>As he spoke, an influential environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, released a study showing an even grimmer picture of environmental problems in the bomb plants, with 14 of the 17 major plants found to be in violation of hazardous waste laws.</p> <p>The council and 20 other environmental groups filed suit today against the Department of Energy, seeking to foster a public debate about the cleanup and rebuilding of the bomb production system, by compelling the Government to prepare an environmental impact statement. &#39;We Are Not in Compliance&#39;</p> <p>A spokesman for the department, Christina Sankey, said she could not confirm the number of plants with serious pollution problems but agreed, saying &#39;&#39;We are not in compliance.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Watkins said he was ordering a review to see whether the department was complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, the law that calls for environmental impact statements, and that he was personally reviewing each decision on whether to order such a statement, which can entail substantial delay in a project.</p> <p>But he refused to say whether he would order an environmental statement for the overhaul of the whole system of bomb production, a project that would take decades and may cost more than $100 billion. Rise in Cleanup Budget</p> <p>He also said his department would get an additional $300 million in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 for cleanup. The Reagan Administration&#39;s budget called for $1.8 billion, which was increased by President Bush to $2.1 billion, and now to $2.4 billion.</p> <p>Mr. Watkins said he was surprised to learn last week that his department had ignored recommendations made by the National Academy of Sciences from 1983 to 1987 on the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M. The opening of the plant, which is meant for disposal of plutonium-contaminated wastes, has been delayed for months because of questions about its quality. Now, he said, the department will ask the academy for its endorsement of a plan to open the repository. &#39;&#39;They&#39;re going to tell us, I&#39;m sure, &#39;You didn&#39;t listen to us from &#39;83 to &#39;87.&#39; &#39;&#39; Mr. Watkins said.</p> <p>He said the plant would not open until next year, a delay that create a crisis as wastes continue to pile up at temporary storage sites in Rocky Flats. &#39;A Nightmare for Me&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Watkins said another waste disposal project, the plan to store highly radioactive wastes from military reactors and civilian ones at Yucca Mountain near Las Vegas, Nev., had been hamstrung by shortcomings of the Energy Department staff. &#39;&#39;It has been a nightmare for me to try to unravel the background sufficient to make some decision,&#39;&#39; Mr. Watkins said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s been very confusing, and each day is revealed some new technical data.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>He said he had found &#39;&#39;serious flaws&#39;&#39; in the procedures needed to assure that the department&#39;s reactors were safe to operate.</p> <p>The department will have &#39;&#39;an entirely new management team,&#39;&#39; he said, under Victor Stello Jr., now executive director for operations at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Mr. Stello will assure that conformance to environmental laws and attention to these requirements are developed through a safety-conscious culture that will assure production objectives are met without violation of environmental, safety or health standards,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The White House has announced that it plans to nominate Mr. Stello as Assistant Secretary for defense programs, but opposition is expected in the Senate because of unorthodox procedures he used at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in approving cash payments to obtain information. The money was paid to a former utility employee who said he had information implicating a commission official in connection with allegations that have not been disclosed.</p> <p>Mr. Watkins also said he had asked the academy to establish a committee on epidemiologic research to advise the department on ways to study worker health issues. The department plans to create a data base on the health histories of its workers who have been exposed to radiation for use by outside researchers.</p>
637468>U.S. IS UNEQUIPPED TO DISARM A-BOMBS The Federal Government is facing enormous technical challenges in disassembling the nation&#39;s nuclear arsenal and is ill prepared for the job, according to a report released yesterday by the Office of Technology Assessment. The costs of the effort may already have reached $1 billion a year, the study found, but the job has been slowed because there is no more storage space for plutonium. The office, an arm of Congress, also said the delays were caused by a lack of national policy on what should be done with nuclear fuels -- plutonium and highly enriched uranium -- and by a lack of attention to the problem on the part of the White House.  <p>Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who asked for the study last year, said yesterday that the report showed that the current management team, consisting of the Departments of Energy and Defense and the National Security Council, &quot;is designed to supervise the nuclear arms race and not to end it.&quot;</p> <p>Dismantling the arsenal, the Senator said at a news conference in Washington, will require environmental sensitivity and safeguards against material going astray, rather than expertise in the military use of weapons. &quot;Unfortunately, the ability of our cold-war-created bureaucracies to respond to these changes is proving slow and disjointed,&quot; he said. Ending Much Secrecy</p> <p>Senator Glenn, who is chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, said the report &quot;raises serious questions&quot; about meeting the weapons-disassembly schedules laid out in agreements with the former Soviet Union.</p> <p>Energy Secretary Hazel O&#39;Leary said in a phone interview yesterday that the study portrayed the department as it operated in the Bush Administration, and that new personnel, including two from the Office of Technology Assessment, would prove more able than their predecessors.</p> <p>Mrs. O&#39;Leary noted that the report criticized the department for continuing to keep secret many of the details about its nuclear bomb fuel. But she said that since May her department had been working to declassify material and that in the next month, &quot;substantial information will be available.&quot;</p> <p>The report comes as the Energy Department is trying to decide what parts of its weapons production complex to close and what parts to preserve. Those decisions, which have attracted far more attention than the problems of weapons disposal, are sure to be heavily affected by the need to store tons of bomb materials that will remain highly radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. Turnabout in Agency&#39;s Mission</p> <p>The report hinted strongly that it was time to bring other agencies and public oversight into the process. While not making explicit recommendations, the report said the Department of Energy&#39;s Office of Defense programs &quot;may not be well suited to carry out the new nonmilitary mission.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Historically, its activities have been subject to minimal regulation,&quot; the report stated. &quot;Its operations have been conducted in secret, and it has not sought or welcomed public involvement or been concerned about the international implications of its actions. Its priorities continue to be maintaining the warhead stockpile.&quot;</p> <p>But Mrs. O&#39;Leary said that &quot;handing off&quot; the problem to another agency would delay the process by years.</p> <p>The report says Government efforts so far have not been adequate because of weak management at the Department of Energy and a lack of public trust in the agency. Mrs. O&#39;Leary said she was working to build trust by increasing outside input.</p> <p>The report also noted that the technologies available for dismantling warheads and storing nuclear materials are quite limited. Russia, which faces a similar task, has even fewer resources and faces problems its government considers more pressing, the report said. Dangers for Pantex Workers</p> <p>Among the problems cited by the report was the shortage of storage space for plutonium at Pantex, the Energy Department&#39;s plant near Amarillo, Tex., where nuclear bombs have been assembled for decades. Pantex has already sustained environmental damage from the intentional burning of high explosives from old bombs that have been disassembled, and report warned that the exposure of workers to radiation could soar if they handle more weapons.</p> <p>Pantex disassembled nearly 1,300 bombs last year and more than 13,000 since 1980. If all goes according to plan, at least 10,000 more will be dismantled in the next decade, the report said. The office also warned that decommissioning weapons could be delayed by environmentalists who fear that without long-term planning Pantex will become a de-facto permanent repository for plutonium.</p> <p>There is currently no plan for long-term disposal of plutonium or highly enriched uranium, the two primary bomb fuels, the study noted, although the uranium can be diluted for use in commercial power reactors. Plutonium can also be used in reactors, but the study predicted that would be unlikely, because of unfavorable economics and public opposition.</p> <p>The Government might be able to build a fission reactor to destroy the plutonium, perhaps producing electricity in the process, but the research to build it could require decades, the report said.</p>
660603>For Cities in Middle Age, Growing Pains Are Real NEW YORK CITY assumed its current shape 96 years ago in a joyous consolidation of Manhattan and the Bronx with the City of Brooklyn, Staten Island and the area now called Queens. Around much of the country, cities still routinely annex neighboring areas. But for New York, such expansion is now unthinkable, and in fact city government may go the way of Yugoslavia. In November, Staten Island residents voted to secede, and Queens has a small secessionist movement too. Why are some voices in the nation&#39;s biggest city saying, &quot;Smaller is better&quot;? And why is this happening even as younger places, particularly in the Sunbelt, are successfully using the grow-your-own-city technique that New York employed at the last turn of the century?  <p>The short answer: New York is old and aging. For a city still growing into virgin territory, there are advantages, for the psyche and the tax rolls, in expanding its borders. But if growth stops and the municipal budget turns sour, some residents try to bail out.</p> <p>Cities, it appears, can have life cycles no less dramatic than those of caterpillars or frogs, changing form as they age. If Marx had focused on the economies and politics of municipal governments rather than national ones, he might have discerned a pattern of money and politics driving each other at the local level, from expansion to stasis to, in extreme cases, breakup.</p> <p>In the same month as the Staten Island referendum, Houston annexed three areas and Manchester, a small suburb west of St. Louis, moved toward doubling its size through annexation. And Everett, near Seattle, said it wanted to annex an area called Murphy&#39;s Corner. Outside the Northeast, annexations around the country are scarcely news.</p> <p>But not only New York is showing strains. New Haven has a separatist movement, and Toronto&#39;s 30-year-old metropolitan government, long held up as a model of rational consolidation, is under fire.</p> <p>When it was young, New York pursued growth, a popular trend around the turn of the century, in parallel with a growing economy. It worked until the city butted up against municipalities that did not want to be absorbed.</p> <p>&quot;Back when New York was doing it, some other places like Philadelphia and New Orleans and San Francisco were doing it; it was sort of the popular thing to do in the late 1800&#39;s,&quot; said Bruce D. McDowell, head of government policy research at the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.  &#39;A Tower of Strength&#39;</p> <p>In those days, size itself was valued. &quot;The name of a great city is a tower of strength,&quot; said a report on municipal consolidation prepared as a lobbying tool for Manhattan in the mid-1890&#39;s. &quot;There is no good reason why this community and the country should not have the benefit of such prestige,&quot; the report went on. &quot;Magnitude is not a thing of vapory dimensions, but a solid, substantial and determining factor, of which it would be folly to deny ourselves the advantage in important issues.&quot;</p> <p>Annexation captured the increase in value that came to property where there had been improvements -- in those days, bridges. A larger city could collect taxes on both sides of the river, raising revenues from newly-valuable land. &quot;The tax benefits of building those bridges were mostly enjoyed by the governments of Brooklyn and Queens, because land values would go up immensely once those bridges were built,&quot; said Roger Starr of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.</p> <p>Those days are long gone. Since the early 1900&#39;s, according to Mr. McDowell, there have been fewer than 20 consolidations. And when cities lost the ability to expand, they lost the ability to rope in all the growth in their regions.</p> <p>Now the older cities are in a different phase. Growth stops, and municipal budget pressures intensify, and residents look around to see if they would do better in a smaller unit, perhaps with fewer of the poor. In New Haven, residents of the prosperous East Shore section have organized under the slogan, &quot;Secede to Survive.&quot;  When Needs Change</p> <p>&quot;When economies are great, every municipality wants to build itself up, and there is very little competition because everyone is happy,&quot; said Robert M. Wright, a professor at the School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at the University of Toronto. When money is tight, he said, &quot;there is a notion of the need to fragment.&quot;</p> <p>That is the case in Toronto, where the metropolitan government handles roads, transit and other region-wide issues, but suburbanites say they carry too much of the tax load.</p> <p>Sunbelt cities still use public works to add value. New subdivisions tie into central water and sewer systems, making development feasible -- and making sure that development happens inside the city, not outside.</p> <p>David P. Rusk, an author and former mayor of Albuquerque, said New Mexico had given his city a veto over construction of water and sewer systems within five miles of its borders, preventing development without the city&#39;s acquiescence. Albuquerque, founded early in the 18th century, had a long infancy. Mr. Rush said it has grown to 150 square miles today from three square miles in 1940. Ah, to be young again, municipally speaking.  IDEAS &amp; TRENDS</p>
829343>Millions of Secrets Burden Energy Agency American makers of nuclear weapons have been classifying virtually everything for so long that the Energy Department now has more secrets than it can cope with, and the department and its contractors may have released information they  should have kept secret, officials said today. The department has 100 million pages of documents that it wants to review for possible release but does not have the resources to do the reviewing. It is spending $3 million to develop a computer program to scan the documents and make an initial assessment. The goal is to reduce the secrets to a manageable quantity.  <p>I want to see a moat, if you will, filled with alligators, that separates what really impacts national security from all the chaff,&quot; said Albert Narath, the chairman of a committee that drafted a new classification policy.</p> <p>The management and winnowing of the classified material came up in the context of a news conference today at which, as expected, the department released a comprehensive history of plutonium production and use in the last 50  years.</p> <p>In the department&#39;s current scheme, ideas are &quot;classified at birth,&quot; or presumed secret until proved otherwise, and some department officials and employees of contractors have lost track of what needs to be kept quiet.</p> <p>Hazel R. O&#39;Leary, the Energy Secretary, said today that most of what was still secret had &quot;occasional mention of something that was perhaps born classified.&quot; She said much of that could probably be declassified.</p> <p>Some material that is still classified is guarding useless secrets but would  be useful in defining the environmental and health damage associated with the production and testing of nuclear weapons, Energy Department officials said.</p> <p>For example, Arlie Bryan Siebert, director of the office of declassification, said that data on fallout were kept secret because they would reveal aspects of  weaponry design, like how much of the blast was from fission and how much from fusion, a factor that &quot;no one cares about&quot; anymore. In contrast, data on releases of radiation from production plants would help an adversary calculate just how much bomb fuel the United States has produced, but today Mrs. O&#39;Leary laid all that out on the table.</p> <p>Other Energy Department documents are classified because they reveal the yield, or destructive power, of certain weapons, but those yields are generally  known anyway, said Stanley Norris, an expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p> <p>Still, Mr. Narath said that some categories of information would always be secret, like weapon design, no matter how old. &quot;In the nuclear weapons business, there is no such thing as an obsolete design,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Mr. Narath twice raised the possibility that some information had been released improperly, but he declined to say how or give examples. But Charles R. Hansen, an author and specialist on nuclear weapons, said he had recently been surprised when a Freedom of Information Act request brought him information on the materials used in a hydrogen bomb.</p> <p>&quot;The people doing some of the reviewing really don&#39;t know what they&#39;re looking at,&quot; said Mr. Hansen, the author of an eight-volume CD-ROM history of nuclear weapons, &quot;The Swords of Armageddon&quot; (Chukelea Publications).</p> <p>&quot;They need to unleash a lot of this low-grade stuff, to try to pull back and  protect what really needs protecting,&quot; he said.</p>
103018>Nevada Is Expected As Congress Choice For Atom Waste Site Congress is on the verge of choosing Nevada as the leading candidate for disposal of the nation&#39;s most dangerous nuclear waste, thus abandoning a carefully fashioned procedure it approved five years ago for scientifically evaluating several locations.  <p>The decision would apparently resolve a politically sensitive issue that has been debated for decades. It would substitute criteria stacked against Nevada in place of a 1982 law that required the Government to choose, after extensive scientific study of up to 10 locations, two storage sites, one in the East and another in the West.</p> <p>The Senate attached the measure to the deficit-reducing package passed Friday and the catchall appropriations bill passed Saturday. The measures have gone to separate conference committees, where lawmakers are seeking to reconcile Senate and House versions. Members of the committee considering the deficit-reducing package are debating the storage site measure.</p> <p>Although no site was identified by name in the Senate version, House members of that conference committee proposed a compromise yesterday that would specifically name Nevada as the location of the storage site.</p> <p>If the proposal stays attached to either bill, passage is considered likely this week. The current policy calls for evaluating three sites simultaneously: Yucca Mountain, Nev., Hanford, Wash., and Deaf Smith County, Tex. The change likely to be adopted would direct the Energy Department to conduct a five- to seven-year review of the Yucca Mountain site first. Only if the Nevada site proved to be technically unsuitable for a nuclear storage site would the others be considered.</p> <p>The criteria listed in the proposal, such as cost and factors that rely on existing knowledge of the sites, appear to best fit Yucca Mountain, on the edge of an area where the Energy Department tests nuclear bombs. Initial studies indicate that Yucca Mountain would be less expensive than the two other sites, and more is known about Yucca Mountain than Deaf Smith County.</p> <p>Gov. Richard H. Bryan of Nevada assailed the proposal, saying it &#39;&#39;serves to fan the flames of regionalism and relegates the technical aspects of site selection to a secondary status far behind political and ease-of-siting considerations.&#39;&#39; The Governor has argued that the Energy Department previously placed Yucca Mountain low on the list of potential sites.</p> <p>Thinly populated Western states have long resented the efforts of Eastern states to place the waste repository in the West. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s like they just decided to go with Nevada out of social Darwinism,&#39;&#39; said Robert Alvarez, director of the Nuclear Project at the Environmental Policy Institute, a non-profit advocacy group based in Washington. &#39;&#39;Nevada could least defend itself. It doesn&#39;t have the kind of votes in the Congress, and they have a site there that the Department of Energy already owns.&#39;&#39; Thousands of Years</p> <p>Wastes from nuclear power plants is now stored at those facilities, but some are running out of space and will have to close in a few years if no alternative storage is found. The material will be radioactive for thousands of years, and major questions remain about how the material will be packaged and buried.</p> <p>Officials in Nevada have complained that the Yucca Mountain site is vulnerable to earthquakes and volcanic activity and that geological considerations make it incompatible with wastes stored in glass, the form that the Federal Department of Energy plans to use for military nuclear wastes.</p> <p>Seeking to fend off the proposed storage facility, the Nevada legislature earlier this year created a new county, called Bullfrog, with what they hoped was a prohibitively high tax rate.</p> <p>The proposal now attached to the budget and appropriations bills was approved as a separate measure by the Senate earlier this month by a vote of 63 to 30. The bill, submitted by Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, and James A. McClure, Republican of Idaho, also provides for payments of $50 million a year to the host state while the facility is being built, and $100 million a year while it accepts waste.The measure was attached to the financial bills in an effort to assure its passage.</p> <p>Critics of the Congressional move say that all proposed sites carry potential problems, but that the new procedure will not allow them to be weighed against each other.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There&#39;s been no systematic assessment of suitable sites,&#39;&#39; Mr. Alvarez said. &#39;It Makes Sense&#39;</p> <p>But a spokesman for the Department of Energy&#39;s Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, Ginger King, said &#39;&#39;from a business point of view, it makes sense&#39;&#39; to thorougly evaluate the sites in sequence rather than at the same time.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You do run the risk, if you pick one and characterize it, of finding out that it is not suitable,&#39;&#39; she said, at which point the department would move on to a second.</p> <p>Representative Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat whose district is down the Columbia River from the Hanford site, criticized the compensation to be paid to the host state. &#39;&#39;This country&#39;s in trouble as long as political buy-offs are relied on rather than good science,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Late yesterday afternoon, House members of the conference committee proposed a measure that would have the Department of Energy cease work on all sites except Yucca Mountain and to drop the compensation payments. A negotiator would work with Nevada, however, on the level of Federal support that would be offered. More negotiation is expected today. Deadlines Began to Slip</p> <p>Under the current law, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the Department of Energy was to study five potential sites and by Jan. 1, 1985, recommend three to the President for thorough evaluation, at a cost of more than $1 billion each. In addition, by July 1, 1989, the department was to find five more potential sites and recommend three of them for a second repository.</p> <p>But the deadlines began to slip almost immediately and the Department has slowed the search for a second site, which would probably be in the East.</p> <p>Nevada officials and environmentalists believe that the Johnston proposal would result in momentum that would be difficult to stop no matter what the technical considerations.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If they begin in putting all of their financial and time resources in one site, and they&#39;re under a time gun as well as a financial gun, they&#39;re going to do anything they can to mask the deficiencies of the site,&#39;&#39; said Steven A.

407788>Energy Chief Says War Would Not Disrupt Oil Fresh from a trip to the oilfields of Saudi Arabia, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said yesterday that war in the Persian Gulf, if it came, would not significantly disrupt the flow of oil. &quot;My gut feeling is that it isn&#39;t going to be our problem,&quot; said Mr. Watkins, a retired admiral, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Wednesday evening. &quot;We&#39;re going to be able to see a flow of oil coming out of the gulf, despite the so-called war that people are saying will automatically raise prices to $60 to $100 a barrel,&quot; he said in remarks to reporters in New York yesterday afternoon. He called that price forecast &quot;a very unfortunate prophecy,&quot; and added: &quot;I don&#39;t accept it. I don&#39;t think it has to go that way. It certainly won&#39;t be a function of shortage; it will be for some other reason.&quot;  <p>In a luncheon speech to members of the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. Watkins said, &quot;Were hostilities to break out, I believe I would still feel safer in Dhahran under General Schwarzkopf&#39;s watchful eye than jaywalking on Fifth Avenue.&quot; Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf is the commander of American forces in Saudi Arabia; Dhahran is in northeastern Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Other experts have previously made some of the points made by Mr. Watkins: that the area has extra pipelines, pumping stations and other equipment, and that oil installations are hard to damage in a way that cannot be quickly fixed; also that Iraq failed to cripple Iran&#39;s exports in their eight-year war, even though Iran lacked the benefit of American troops. But the Energy Department had not previously made the points so forcefully.  Could Add to Reserve</p> <p>Mr. Watkins also said that to reassure the market, the American embassy in Saudi Arabia -- with the cooperation of the national oil company and the petroleum ministry -- was planning to set up a system to collect and transmit data on oil shipments.</p> <p>Despite his assessment, Mr. Watkins added that if war came, he would recommend to the President that the United States open the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a way to dampen price reaction.</p> <p>Mr. Watkins also said that when the crisis was over, the United States could add quickly to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to provide a cushion for future crises, and to soak up the extra oil that is likely to be around. Oil experts say that now that production has exceeded pre-crisis levels, a peaceful end to the standoff would create a huge surplus in production capacity after Iraq and Kuwait resume exports.</p> <p>The reserve is now at 590 million barrels, and the current goal is 750 million. In the face of a rising pattern of imports, however, many experts have called for a billion-barrel reserve. The key constraint in the past has been finding the money to buy the oil.</p> <p>Mr. Watkins said that the United States was discussing with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and three other producers the possibility of leasing, not buying, oil for the reserve. That idea, which was under discussion before Iraq&#39;s invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, has never been fully detailed, but in broad terms the plan would be to store oil in the salt domes of Louisiana and Texas, under the control of the Federal Government, with ownership retained by the producing country.  Oil Companies Called Fair</p> <p>In his remarks, Mr. Watkins also said that &quot;the free market has done a pretty good job&quot; in setting prices, but that the public was upset about rising prices because &quot;we don&#39;t have the patience to allow the free market to do its thing over time.&quot; He added, however, that oil prices had undergone some &quot;oscillations which are not justified.&quot;</p> <p>The oil companies have been &quot;fair and responsible&quot; in marketing their products, he said. Gasoline prices have not been manipulated, he said, and added, &quot;My guess is that the free market will let those prices continue to decline now.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Watkins said he could not comment on a charge by one of his deputies on Thursday that Japan was inappropriately building oil stocks.</p> <p>The Associated Press reported from Tokyo yesterday that senior Government officials there said that they were not stockpiling, but importing the same amount of oil as in the previous year.</p>
264100>The ABC&#39;s of Burying a Nuclear Plant IF a big question about the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station was answered last week, with the vote by the shareholders of the Long Island Lighting Company to sell it for $1 in exchange for rate increases, a thousand smaller questions remain.  <p>The first reactor likely to close before it opens, Shoreham will now apparently be the first full-sized plant to be decommissioned. Technically, that means taking the plant apart, burying the radioactive parts in a suitable spot and freeing the site for re-use. In practice, no one is sure how - or when - that will be done.</p> <p>A day after Lilco shareholders accepted the deal offered by New York State to sell Shoreham to the Long Island Power Authority, which would scrap it, the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington voted to try to keep the plant intact, by prohibiting the sale to the authority. But even supporters of Shoreham said it will be difficult to save the $5.5 billion plant from eventual dismantlement.</p> <p>The Department of Energy argues that if the plant can be kept in operable condition for a few years, public opinion against Shoreham could be swayed by the rising cost and limited availability of electricity, or Gov. Mario M. Cuomo may be replaced by someone more sympathetic. Taking Out the Fuel</p> <p>Regardless of the opposition, Lilco plans to consult this week with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on taking the fuel out of the reactor, starting in the next few days.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s permission we&#39;re seeking,&#39;&#39; said Joseph W. McDonnell, a Lilco spokesman. &#39;&#39;We&#39;ll just sort of lay out to them how we would go about doing it, and work cooperatively with them. We don&#39;t view this in any way as controversial.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>De-fueling, performed every year or so in regular operations, begins with using a 30-foot-tall crane built into the cylindrical containment building to lift concrete blocks out of the way, lift the huge steel lid off the reactor vessel and flood the area with water. Then, a smaller crane will gently pluck out the 100 tons of uranium fuel in 560 fuel rods, one at a time, and carry them under water to a transfer canal, and then to a spent fuel pool. It will take about 45 days.</p> <p>Except for testing the fuel at 5 percent power, accumulating the equivalent of less than three weeks of full-power use, the reactor has gone unused since loading was finished in January 1985. When the fuel was loaded, it was barely radioactive, and could be handled by workers wearing cotton gloves and ordinary overalls. At a nuclear plant, nearly all the radioactivity is created in the process of making power. When a chain reaction is induced, the uranium atoms are split to give off energy, and the atoms that result are internally unstable, emitting subatomic particles and energy waves called radiation.</p> <p>The fuel can be easily removed, but it is now waste. There is as yet no repository in this country for spent fuel. The Department of Energy is investigating a site in Nevada, near where it explodes nuclear bombs, but even if the area proves suitable, it would not open until the next century. Also, it is not clear whether the Lilco fuel would be eligible; other utilities are assured of space because they pay a tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour that their reactors produce, but Lilco has never paid. More Contamination</p> <p>Even after the fuel is removed, other parts of the plant will be contaminated. The reason is that the chain reaction throws off subatomic particles called neutrons, and those that do not split other atoms can be absorbed by structural materials or minerals in the water, which then adhere to pipes. With the addition of a neutron, those atoms emit radiation.</p> <p>How much steel and concrete is radioactive will not be clear until it can be measured. Whether some can be cleaned by washing, or whether it will have to be chopped up, depends on the degree of contamination.</p> <p>As a result of the accident at Three Mile Island and other problems at nuclear plants, the industry has developed remote-controlled torches, hoses and other devices that can enter highly radioactive areas. Decommissioning a full-size reactor, however, is more ambitious than the work done thus far.</p> <p>The magnitude of the job will be clearer after the New York Power Authority, which will do the dismantling, submits a plan to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. But the authority says it will not develop the plan until the financing is in place, after the deal goes through. The money is to come from the Long Island Power Authority, which will get its money from Lilco. In addition no one is sure what will happen to other radioactive parts of the plant. New York State does not have a repository for low-level waste.</p> <p>Thus a prologue of 22 years of construction, testing and preparation is moving straight to an epilogue of dismantling. Of the 30 plants ordered in 1967, Shoreham was not the first to meet its end, however; several were abandoned, and Three Mile Island 2 melted down after a year of operation. Some of the 30, like Millstone 2 just across Long Island Sound, and Maine Yankee, in Wiscassett, have had time to log more than 10 years of operation while Shoreham was being built and waiting. Now, Shoreham&#39;s experience may help them prepare for the end of their lives.</p> <p>IDEAS &amp; TRENDS</p>
714587>How to Keep a Warm House From Turning Dangerous VITAS GERULAITIS was not the first person to die from carbon monoxide from a faulty heater, but his celebrity has focused attention on the problem. At least 250 people are fatally poisoned this way every year, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and 5,000 or so more suffer injuries, some of them permanent. Propane equipment, the apparent villain in the death of the former tennis star whose body was found Sunday afternoon in a cottage in Southampton, L.I., is a common cause, along with natural gas heating systems, but oil furnaces and even wood stoves can be deadly.  <p>&quot;Anything that has a combustion process is capable of providing carbon monoxide,&quot; said B. W. Ward, the manager of technical services at the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, known as Ashrae. The key, Mr. Ward and others said, is proper installation and maintenance.</p> <p>Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is produced whenever a fuel is burned without enough oxygen on hand. Carbon atoms in the fuel that normally join up with two oxygen atoms to form carbon dioxide, which is harmless, end up instead with only one oxygen atom. Absorbed through the lungs, carbon monoxide latches onto hemoglobin, the molecule in blood that normally shuttles oxygen to the cells, and refuses to let go.</p> <p>When 25 percent of the hemoglobin has absorbed carbon monoxide, serious headache and nausea set in; at 50 percent, many victims are dead.  People who die from smoke inhalation from fires in buildings die primarily because of carbon monoxide, said Arthur E. Cote, the chief engineer at the National Fire Protection Association in Quincy, Mass.</p> <p>In every winter cold snap, there are nearly always a few people who die from carbon monoxide poisoning, most often from faulty space heaters. Sometimes there are spectacular cases: a Burlington, Vt., couple and their older daughter were killed as they slept in December 1988; the younger daughter survived because her bedroom window was open. The former owner of the house, who had known something was wrong with the heater, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.</p> <p>In another case, a type of gas furnace manufactured in the Chicago area from 1984 to 1988 was linked to 10 deaths in separate incidents. The Consumer Product Safety Commission arranged a recall but has had difficulty finding all the furnaces sold.</p> <p>The commission has been moving toward requiring carbon monoxide detectors in newly built homes, an idea that divides experts in the field. But the commission and others who have studied the problem agree that the toll is far too high. &quot;The tragedy for all victims of carbon monoxide poisoning is that their deaths are entirely preventable,&quot; said Ann Brown, the chairman of the commission, in a statement after Mr. Gerulaitis&#39;s death.</p> <p>The best defense, experts say, is annual inspection by a heating contractor or a technician from the local gas utility. Inspectors can spot flaws by sight and use hand-held sniffers to detect carbon monoxide, said Joseph F. Hilyard, a spokesman for the Gas Research Institute in Chicago.</p> <p>Any heating unit can go bad, but when that happens, systems that use forced hot air are the most dangerous, because the air ducts distribute the carbon monoxide.</p> <p>Some engineers say that gas units are in general somewhat more prone to kill without warning, because oil smoke is more visible and acrid and the residents of a house are more likely to smell a problem in time to take action. Still, even an oil furnace can kill a sleeping family.</p> <p>The presence of carbon monoxide in the living area means that exhaust gas from the heater is leaking in. In a forced-air system, it may be because of a leak in the plenum, essentially a metal box that is heated by the flames. Clean air is pumped through the plenum to be warmed and then through ducts around the house, but if there is a hole, the air can be contaminated.</p> <p>Systems that circulate hot water through radiators are also vulnerable, because holes can develop in the flue, the path for exhaust gas inside the chimney.</p> <p>Even without a hole, smoke can get in. Most systems have an opening where some room air is drawn out of the house to run up the flue, increasing the draft and carrying away smoke. If animals get into the flue, they can block it and the smoke will come back out of that hole.</p> <p>&quot;Natural gas burns the cleanest, so you don&#39;t have a soot buildup, but you can have a squirrel&#39;s nest or a bird&#39;s nest or a dead bird,&quot; said William V. Federici, a spokesman for Brooklyn Union Gas. The company sends out notices with its bills, urging its customers to have annual inspections. Brooklyn Union also suggests that chimneys have wire mesh or a cage over the opening.</p> <p>Flues can also stop working effectively if the house has powerful exhaust fans, say in the kitchen or bathroom, that create a negative pressure when operated.</p> <p>Flues can also be subject to damage from sulfuric acid, formed in the furnace or boiler from sulfur in the fuel. Experts caution that this may be a special problem for homeowners who have replaced old systems with new, high-efficiency models.</p> <p>&quot;High efficiency&quot; means that the system is designed to get as much heat value as possible out of each gallon of oil or cubic foot of gas, by extracting more heat from the combustion gases and sending cooler exhaust up the stack. That is fine, but if the exhaust is cool enough, sulfur that would otherwise be in gaseous form, flowing up the stack harmlessly (if you don&#39;t count acid rain), will instead condense back into a liquid and attack the flue walls.</p> <p>Electronic carbon monoxide detectors, which are about the size of smoke detectors and generally cost from $50 to $80. Trade associations like the Gas Research Institute and the American Gas Association have taken no position on them, and some utilities oppose them; Mr. Federici said they could be set off by things like hair spray. They can also be set off by a whiff of exhaust from a car as it is being parked in a garage under the house.</p> <p>Mr. Cote of the National Fire Protection Association, on the other hand, said carbon monoxide detectors are &quot;relatively inexpensive protection.&quot;</p> <p>They are not foolproof, Mr. Ward of Ashrae said. &quot;A carbon monoxide detector would be an excellent investment,&quot; he added. &quot;However, you&#39;ve got to know where to put it.&quot;</p> <p>A detector in the basement will do little good if the flue develops a hole near the roof line, he said; the concentrations of carbon monoxide around the house would also differ according to the speed and direction of wind outside, he continued, so a detector on the wrong side would fail to recognize a problem.</p> <p>Consumer Reports recommends placing the detector near the sleeping area and installing any additional units in living areas.</p> <p>Several manufacturers make chemical carbon monoxide detector cards, which sell for a few dollars each and are supposed to change color when exposed. Consumer Reports tried three and found that only one worked. Even if the color change occurs, the magazine pointed out, the resident still has to look at the card to know if there&#39;s a problem. It advised against them.</p>
718762>Federal Caller-ID Rule Sparks Privacy Debate IT&#39;S already routine for people who have caller identification: The phone rings and before you pick it up, you can glance at a screen that tells you the telephone number of the person calling.  But if the party placing the call does not want to be identified in advance, he or she can enter a special code before dialing your number, three extra strokes that mask the caller&#39;s identity. If you are annoyed by not being able to tell who is calling before you say &quot;hello,&quot; you can retaliate. You can tell the phone company that you refuse all such calls; then, the anonymous caller will hear a recording stating that your phone won&#39;t ring for unidentifiable callers.  <p>Caller ID is now available only for calls that originate and end in the same state, but beginning in April, if the Federal Communications Commission has its way, it will work with calls placed between states.</p> <p>There is a glitch, though. Utility regulators in about two dozen states, including New York, say the F.C.C.&#39;s plan to expand caller ID infringes on the privacy of callers, and they have asked the commission to rewrite its rule. They propose to allow people to mask their identities automatically on all calls, rather than call by call, a system adopted by many states. Privacy experts and advocates for victims of domestic violence are backing this position.</p> <p>The F.C.C., however, says that allowing businesses to identify callers will help commerce and economic development. It also says the nation needs uniform rules from state to state.</p> <p>The result is a debate that would have been unimaginable a few years ago, when finding out who was calling meant saying into the receiver, &quot;Who is this?&quot; If the Federal Government does not reconsider its position soon, California is promising to argue against it in Federal court, and New York has said it may join the suit.</p> <p>Caller ID is already available in most states. What the F.C.C. rule does is to order the three big long-distance carriers, AT&amp;T, Sprint and MCI, to make their caller information available to local phone companies beginning in April, so they can tell their caller ID customers who the caller is, even if the call is long distance.</p> <p>&quot;We felt caller ID basically was in the public interest,&quot; Rosemary Kimball, a spokeswoman for the commission, said last week. With caller ID, for instance, a bank could let its customers handle more business over the phone, because it would have greater assurance of the identity of the caller. A manufacturer of, say, vacuum cleaners that placed an advertisement in a national newspaper would be able to direct callers to the nearest dealership without the shopper ever having to say where home was. A catalogue merchant could quickly call up data from its computer that would indicate the status of a caller&#39;s account even before the sales representative answered.</p> <p>Caller ID, combined with computer software that provides addresses, would allow a pizzeria to check that the call for 16 large anchovy pies to be delivered to a certain address wasn&#39;t coming from a prankster across town.</p> <p>State utility commissions, which regulate local phone companies, have generally agreed that caller ID can be useful, but they have also declared that privacy is in the public interest. Mark Fogelman, a lawyer at the California Public Utility Commission, said caller ID now exists in 48 states and the District of Columbia -- only Alaska and Hawaii don&#39;t have it -- and some form of the service that blocks caller ID is available in 41 states.</p> <p>In 25 states, Mr. Fogelman said, consumers who choose can block caller ID on all calls from their line, whether they subscribe to caller ID or not.</p> <p>&quot;It seems ridiculous and unnecessarily costly to require that those states unroll the existing options,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Regulators say that just because a telephone subscriber wants to dial another person or a business, it does not necessarily follow that that subscriber wants to let the person or business have his phone number.  A person with an unlisted number, for example, might see a television advertisment for a miracle vegetable slicer and call the 800 number promptly to get the Ginsu knife free, but might not want to give the marketing firm his phone number. (Caveat emptor: caller ID has been standard equipment on 800 and 900 numbers for some years.)</p> <p>In most states, callers can mask themselves and block caller ID by dialing &quot;* 67&quot; before each call, often for no charge. But if they forget to use this code each time, they lose their anonymity.</p> <p>To a victim of domestic violence, or even a person arguing with a merchant from his home telephone, masking a call may be important. But Peter A. Bradford, the chairman of the New York Public Service Commission, said in June: &quot;Per-call blocking represents the worst of all worlds. The harassing caller is unlikely to forget to use per-call blocking.&quot;</p> <p>In a letter to Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Bradford wrote: &quot;For every consumer who believes that this technology will allow them to let unwanted calls go unanswered, another (perhaps a family violence center, a probation officer or a psychiatrist) fears inadvertently disclosing a home telephone number to someone threatening.&quot;</p> <p>Advocates for victims of domestic violence are particularly worried. Sigrid Hammond, a volunteer at Family Matters, a group in Saratoga, N.Y., that assists victims of domestic violence, said the caller might be a battered wife calling her husband from a shelter but not wanting him to be able to find her, or a child in such a family calling his father without realizing he was giving away his location.</p> <p>Worse, Ms. Hammond said, is that the &quot;* 67&quot; command has different functions on different telephones. In New York and many other states, if the telephone subscriber chooses per-call masking, then &quot;* 67&quot; blocks a single call. But if the subscriber has chosen to have all calls masked, the &quot;* 67&quot; turns the masking off for a single call.</p> <p>A telephone customer in her own home may find it easy to keep straight, Ms. Hammond said, but what about a battered woman who flees with her children to a friend&#39;s house, and then maybe a parent&#39;s house, and then a shelter, in the space of a few days?</p> <p>Ms. Hammond said she was disappointed by the F.C.C.&#39;s decision. &quot;There&#39;s obviously a lot of financial interest in this,&quot; Ms. Hammond continued. &quot;But it&#39;s not an interest that represents Mr. and Mrs. Simple Citizen who just want to have a telephone, and don&#39;t want the world to have some new access to their home that they didn&#39;t have before.&quot;</p> <p>Of course, advocates point out, Mr. and Mrs. Simple Citizen can get in the game relatively inexpensively themselves; a caller ID device that works with existing phones can be bought for as little as $30 and is included on some newer phones. The monthly service fee is fairly low; in New York it is $6.50 a month, unless it is bought as a package with other telephone services, in which case it is even less.</p> <p>The F.C.C. believes it is protecting privacy adequately. Its rule bars companies that have gathered data through caller ID from reselling that data without the caller&#39;s permission. So for example, the company that advertises the vacuum cleaners cannot sell its list of customers&#39; phone numbers to a life-insurance company. And long-distance carriers must tell their customers that their phone numbers can be learned by people they call, the F.C.C. has ruled.</p> <p>In theory, the F.C.C.&#39;s jurisdiction is over interstate calls only. But many state officials say that Federal policy will prevail over all calls, because the phone companies are not equipped to give per-line masking on intrastate calls at the same time that they give only per-call masking on the interstate ones. California, however, is exploring whether it can require per-line masking in the state even if the Federal Government forbids it interstate.</p> <p>What the states really want, though, is a Federal policy that defers to the rules of the state from which the call is placed.</p> <p>And the states are not giving up. Mr. Bradford, of the New York Public Service Commission, has an approach that has won him some allies. Caller ID reduces the value of an unlisted phone number, he argues, because it often results in the customer inadvertently disclosing his number. Therefore, he argues, telephone companies should not be allowed to continue to charge for unlisted numbers.</p> <p>In New York State, about 34 percent of phone numbers are unlisted, and the company Nynex charges $1.95 a month for this service. Costs are small, and revenues come to millions of dollars a month. For several reasons, probably including that one, Nynex is backing New York State&#39;s position against the F.C.C.</p>
1521185>Amtrak Workers Plan Strike To Protest Lack of Financing Six Amtrak unions are to announce on Wednesday that they will stop work on Oct. 3, shutting the railroad for the day, to protest Congress&#39;s failure to pass a $1.8 billion appropriation for the railroad for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. If carried out, it would be the first time Amtrak workers have walked off the job to protest Congressional policy. In the past, workers have struck over wages or other workplace issues.  <p>A railroad official said Amtrak would probably seek an injunction to stop them, but union officials said they believed that they were justified under the law and cited a 1982 Supreme Court ruling involving longshoremen who protested the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by refusing to load fertilizer on ships going to the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Charles F. Moneypenny, the director of the Railroad Division of the Transport Workers Union, which represents 2,000 Amtrak car cleaners and on-board service personnel, said the object was to demonstrate Amtrak&#39;s importance.</p> <p>Mr. Moneypenny, who was also a member of the Amtrak Reform Council, a group created by Congress to look for long-term solutions for the beleaguered railroad, said, &#39;&#39;If Amtrak seeks to enjoin us from walking, and if there are other public figures who criticize such a move, what they&#39;re saying is, &#39;Amtrak must be pretty important because we can&#39;t let these guys shut the system down.&#39; &#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Moneypenny said such a complaint would prove the union&#39;s point.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Amtrak is important,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Fund it to the level at least that the president of Amtrak says he needs to operate.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Amtrak&#39;s president, David L. Gunn, asked Congress for $1.8 billion for the next fiscal year. The House passed an appropriations bill including exactly half that sum for Amtrak. The full Senate has not acted, but the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $1.346 billion.</p>
456005>Environmental Negotiators Flesh Out Bare-Bones Law About 200 lawyers, engineers and chemists have been meeting intermittently in the ballrooms of unfashionable hotels around Washington for several months, wrestling with the landmark Clean Air Act. Although Congress finished work on the law last year, these representatives of oil companies, auto makers, Federal agencies, state governments, environmental groups, and everyone from the National Corn Growers Association to the National Association of Convenience Stores have been engaged in writing the details.  <p>These include how gasoline will have to be reformulated to make it burn more cleanly, what parts of the country will have to have the cleaner gasoline, and how the new fuel will be tested.</p> <p>The forum is a proceeding called regulatory negotiation or, to those in the know, &quot;reg-neg,&quot; under which regulations are negotiated by interested parties rather than by the Government department that will administer them -- in this case, the Environmental Protection Agency.</p> <p>The law itself lays out a bare-bones framework, said David Doniger, an air pollution specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, and is ambiguous or contradictory on important details. &quot;Many of the main issues were left in play by the Congress,&quot; he said. &quot;Many are technical and others are policy decisions.&quot;</p> <p>Environmentalists and oil industry executives agree on the scope of the task, but they accuse each other of trying to undo compromises made in Congress, and reopen battles that had supposedly been settled. Whether they can reach agreement is uncertain, but environmentalists predict catastrophe for the oil companies if no agreement is reached, and to some extent, the oil companies agree.</p> <p>Almost every significant law that Congress passes requires regulations to enforce it, and when the issue is complicated, the appropriate agency publishes a proposed rule and then holds hearings and collects testimony from affected parties or interest groups. Then it publishes a final regulation. In many cases, however, there is an additional step: some aggrieved party, either a company or an interest group, sues to overturn the regulation.</p> <p>The Clean Air group is at the heart of an alternate procedure, in which the affected parties, rather than testifying, sit around a table and argue and circulate drafts of regulations. (Because Government officials participate, the group has to meet in hotels that accept the standard Government rate: Holiday Inns, Quality Inns and other places slightly off the lobbyists&#39; beaten track.)</p> <p>The process has been in use for several years on an experimental basis, but Congress passed a law last year formalizing it. Participants say it is especially useful in environmental laws, and it has already been employed to develop regulations for laws on truck engines that do not conform to new anti-pollution rules, pollutants that leak from valves and pipes at factories and refineries, and pollutants from wood stoves. Incentives and Punishments</p> <p>The regulations produced by negotiation tend to be more stringent than those issued by agencies under the old system, said Philip J. Harter, a Washington lawyer who is a &quot;facilitator&quot; in the clean air negotiations and is credited by several participants as being the father of the process. But industry gets something in exchange, he said. In many cases industry gets a set of regulations with incentives as well as punishments, promising, for example, less regulation for companies that clean up by more than the minimum amount.</p> <p>The result, he said, was more effective laws.</p> <p>Some people complain that &quot;reg-neg&quot; usurps power that belongs elsewhere. William Berman, an environment specialist with the Washington office of the American Automobile Association, said the proceeding, of which he is a part, was &quot;like a big chess game,&quot; in which the participants maneuver for position in a series of political compromises, refereed by the Environmental Protection Agency. He said the E.P.A. should write the regulations itself, as was done for 30 years under the Administrative Procedures Act.  A Rein on Challenges</p> <p>&quot;We didn&#39;t create the agencies to be the appeasers,&quot; he complained, arguing that substantive decisions about what a law says should be made by lawmakers as the law is drafted, not lawyers after the law is enacted.</p> <p>But others involved in negotiations on these and other regulations say the process tends to produce rules that environmentalists consider effective and that industry accepts as not unduly burdensome. An additional advantage is that the important parties usually promise that if an agreement results, they will be bound by it. The groups also promise to try to restrain their members from challenging the agreement.</p> <p>State governments, which are also in the negotiations, are constitutionally prohibited from making such agreements. But they are arguing informally that if the regulations create a strong law for improving air quality, they will refrain from passing their own individual regulations on fuel, auto inspection and maintenance and other areas. If the regulations are weak, the states say, they will act on their own, perpetuating a patchwork of regulations that will be difficult for interstate oil companies.</p> <p>Charles DiBona, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry&#39;s main trade association, said the oil companies would have to make billions of dollars in new investments to meet the clean fuel requirements, and would have to start work soon to meet the deadlines. But, he added, the industry would not accept unfavorable regulations simply to speed the process or to avoid the risk that a court challenge by environmentalists might eventually produce unfavorable regulations.  Partial Success a Possibility</p> <p>The E.P.A. is supposed to issue regulations this fall and has set a deadline of the end of this month for the negotiations to produce results; if they do not, the agency will issue regulations on its own. Partial success is also a possibility, with consensus regulations on some questions and E.P.A. rulings on others.</p> <p>A late complication in the negotiations has been a decision by the Bush Administration that the E.P.A. cannot be bound by the results, because it is constitutionally required to consider any comments it receives on the draft rules from non-members of the committee. Negotiators for other participants say, however, that in practice, anyone with any interest is already represented, and they believe that an agreement, if they can reach one, will carry great weight.</p> <p>Mr. Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council said, &quot;Really, what&#39;s going on is that the Office of Management and Budget hates reg-neg, because it denies their power to come in with late hits and jerk the E.P.A. around.&quot; Proposed regulations are often changed late in the game, he added, after industries lobby the White House.  31-Member Committee</p> <p>Technically the group holding the negotiations is an advisory committee to the E.P.A., although the agency is itself a member. In all there are 31 members, mostly oil companies, chemical companies, environmental groups like Mr. Doniger&#39;s, and state officials. In addition, two professional mediators are on the committee. Most members bring a small entourage of technical experts.</p> <p>Problems in the negotiations include resolving an apparent ambiguity on how much volatility -- a measure of how easily a liquid evaporates -- gasoline may have, and specifying the way minimum levels of oxygen-carrying molecules, called oxygenates, in gasoline are calculated. Another issue is the setting of parameters for certain tests that resemble statistical estimates more than precise measurements.</p>
534974>Carbon Tax: Green Twist on Oil Price Preparing for the Earth Summit that opened in Rio de Janeiro this week, representatives of the European Community&#39;s 12 nations proposed a carbon tax -- a tax tied to the amount of carbon dioxide that burning the fuel creates. That step reopened an old dispute over the pricing of oil: When the importing nations talk of raising prices to hold down consumption, exporting nations threaten to do the job for them and keep the revenue for themselves.  <p>After the commissioners of the European Community conditionally approved a carbon tax that would amount to $3 a barrel on oil, and would rise to $10 a barrel by 2000, Saudi Arabia, the world&#39;s largest oil exporter, quickly responded that it would simply freeze its level of production, which would force up the price of oil. And sure enough, as soon as the Saudis spoke, the price rose $1 a barrel.  As it happens, the European tax is contingent upon the United States and Japan going along -- such a huge &quot;if&quot; that it will probably be a stopper. The tax would be based in part on carbon-dioxide creation and in part on fuel costs, covering coal, oil, natural gas and, oddly, nuclear energy, which produces no carbon dioxide.</p> <p>From the Saudis&#39; point of view, these latest events must be exasperating. For years the governments of countries that import oil pleaded with Riyadh to invest in new pumping capacity, to permit price stability and allow the importers&#39; economies to grow. That request became urgent after Iraq invaded Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia quickly obliged by raising its production to 8.5 million barrels a day, from 5.5 million.</p> <p>Now, suddenly, at least in the European Community, governments want to increase the price of oil, to cut consumption.</p> <p>There is not much new in the struggle over who will grow rich on oil. Daniel Yergin, an energy historian, pointed out that oil producers sought higher prices in the 1960&#39;s and 1970&#39;s after European countries raised taxes on oil as a means of raising revenue. &quot;It&#39;s deja vu, but seen through green-tinted sunglasses,&quot; he said, noting that consumers might feel good about a &quot;green tax&quot; meant to help the environment.</p> <p>But even if the industrial world eventually agrees on a carbon tax, its effects are not so clear. It might not hurt exporters, at least not as badly as it looks at first glance. And the weapon chosen by Saudi Arabia, a pre-emptive price rise, may not be useful to the kingdom.</p> <p>For one thing, Saudi Arabia&#39;s thinking for a decade has been to assure a future demand for oil, because it has a supply in the ground that would last for decades. Thus in every price move it tries to engineer, it will want to avoid making oil so costly that the alternatives are economically attractive. Oil May Do Well</p> <p>Even if a carbon tax emerges from the Rio meeting, oil may not do so badly. If drafted the way scientists want, such a tax would hit hardest not at oil but at coal.</p> <p>Roger Dower, a climate change expert at the World Resources Institute, suggested that the European Community might soon move to reorganize its taxes, keeping total revenue constant but gathering more from high-carbon fuels like coal and less from low-carbon ones like natural gas. If fuels are taxed on the basis of their carbon content, oil is in a strong position relative to coal. &quot;Oil could hardly lose,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The proposal the European Community has on the table in Rio is essentially hypothetical, given the unlikelihood that the United States and Japan will go along. Even some members of the community may balk.</p> <p>Peter Beutel, an analyst at Pegasus Econometric Associates, described the sudden price run-up in the oil markets as &quot;a series of emotional reactions to emotional reactions.&quot;</p> <p>Even if the developed world eventually imposes such a tax, this alone does not imply lower oil sales, at least not for long, although it might mean a loss of income to oil-exporting nations.</p> <p>Anthony E. Reinsch, vice president of the Canadian Energy Research Institute, in Calgary, Alberta, ran a computer simulation that assumed a tax of 10 percent on light-oil products, like gasoline and diesel oil, in the major industrial countries. The result, he said, was to depress demand and therefore the world price of oil, which stimulated demand in countries that did not impose a tax. Undercutting the Logic</p> <p>&quot;The net impact from a volume standpoint was zero,&quot; he said. &quot;There was a dip and then a recovery.&quot;</p> <p>If the world economy behaved like the model, that would undercut the logic of a carbon tax, because it would put the countries that imposed the tax at a competitive disadvantage.</p> <p>Mr. Reinsch described Saudi Arabia&#39;s recent move as &quot;a little bit of soap-boxing,&quot; and Mr. Beutel suggested that if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries actually raised the price $2 or $3 a barrel, the higher price would coax forth new supplies that would bring the price back down anyway.</p> <p>But all this gives more credence to the carbon tax proposal than it may deserve. Agreeing on the details of such a tax will always be difficult for the world, and even for Europe alone.</p> <p>&quot;Because of the difference in the fuel mix, different countries have quite distinct and different perceptions of where the balance should be set,&quot; said Irving Mintzer, the coordinator of the Stockholm Environmental Institute&#39;s Climate Change and Sustainable Development Program.</p> <p>A tax based strictly on carbon content would be seen by some members of the European Community as too favorable to France and its policy of nuclear power, he said. Other countries, including the United States, have politically powerful coal interests. No country relishes seeing its energy prices rise higher than its neighbor&#39;s, handicapping its industries. Fear of Saudi Action</p> <p>At present, the logic that prevails in the market is the Saudi threat, with about $1 of the current price of oil representing anticipation of constricted supply. &quot;This has very definitely affected the psychology of the market,&quot; Mr. Yergin said.</p> <p>The factors that contribute to the price increase, he pointed out, include expectations for a global economic recovery and rising demand, along with anticipation of the normal increase in demand in the third quarter of every year.</p> <p>Separating the other factors from the fear of Saudi action is difficult. By the time the Earth Summit ends, the possibility of a carbon tax may have faded.</p>
764067>At Clarkson U., Students Are Racing With the Sun Some schools win at football. In April, Clarkson University won at hazardous waste disposal, and next month it will try cross-country racing with a car less powerful than a hair dryer. Clarkson, in Potsdam, N.Y., about 100 miles southwest of Montreal, has some traditional sports too; its hockey team made the National Collegiate Athletic Association final round last season. But the hot sport on this small campus of 2,600 undergraduate and graduate students is solar racing. A Clarkson team is building a car about the size of a Cadillac, but with only three wheels and a single seat. It costs as much as three Rolls-Royces.  <p>The solar-powered car is scheduled to compete with 39 others next month in the Sunrayce, a 1,150-mile drive that starts in Indianapolis and ends in Boulder, Colo. And all the entries in the race will draw stares. Clarkson&#39;s car, according to the faculty adviser, Dr. Eric F. Thacher, &quot;looks like a squashed shark.&quot;</p> <p>That is unusual for a car, but not for an entry in an engineering competition, which now includes such oddities as canoes made of concrete.</p> <p>&quot;This is the new way to educate engineers -- to try to build projects like this into the core of your program,&quot; said Dr. Thacher, a mechanical engineer and associate professor in the aeronautical engineering program. &quot;What you basically have is a small engineering company embedded in an academic institution.&quot;</p> <p>The trend has caught on in the last few years. Dr. Susan E. Powers, a faculty adviser for the team that won the competition to design a hazardous waste disposal system, said that when she received her bachelor&#39;s degree from Clarkson in 1983, &quot;there was nothing.&quot; Now, she said, &quot;engineering educators are learning we don&#39;t operate in a vacuum; any exposure to real-life problems is great.&quot;</p> <p>Competition motivates the students, she said, adding, &quot;They put more into it than if they are doing it just for a grade.&quot;</p> <p>To build their solar-powered car, Clarkson students first made a life-size wood-and-plexiglass model of the car and covered that with fiberglass. Then they cut the fiberglass in half, pulled it off the model, sanded the fiberglass down and used the halves as a mold for a composite body, which was made out of carbon fibers and a foam of recycled polyvinyl-chloride.</p> <p>The race, whose sponsors include the Department of Energy and the General Motors Corporation, is run during daylight hours only. It starts on June 20 and is scheduled to end on June 29, weather permitting.</p> <p>The drivers will have to look like overweight jockeys: no more than 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighing at least 170 pounds, or carry ballast to make up the difference. And the job has its drawbacks. The driver will be practically lying flat four hours at a time in a foam box on a sunny day. The discomfort is the price for low wind resistance.</p> <p>The Sunrayce is not exactly drag racing. The cars have a maximum horsepower of less than 3 -- or, put in more modern terms, about eight-tenths that of a hair dryer.</p> <p>The team had 40 members until the school year ended earlier this month, and about two dozen are still at work, almost round the clock. A lot of testing remains to be done.</p> <p>This will be the third running of the Sunrayce; the first was held in 1990, and the second in 1993. Both were won by teams from the University of Michigan.</p> <p>The competition is strict. The maximum allowable area of solar cells, which make electricity from sunlight, is 8 square meters, and only American-made crystalline silicon cells can be used. Batteries must be lead acid. The batteries and the cells that the rules specify are not state-of-the-art, but they are relatively inexpensive.</p> <p>But money is still a factor. The team includes business students, who have brought in about $250,000 in cash and donations in kind from Xerox, Rochester Gas &amp; Electric and Wheelabrator Environmental Systems.</p> <p>Advances in electrical, mechanical and aeronautical engineering are making the technology better, said Leslie Anne Hummel, the team administrator. The Michigan car won the 1993 race at an average speed of 28.7 miles an hour, including stop lights, breakdowns and pit stops.</p> <p>In the 1993 race, Clarkson&#39;s teamwork did not go perfectly. An electrical component called a power point tracker, which varies the voltage in the wiring to make the solar cells work better, was not completed in time to be installed. The Clarkson car finished in 28th place.</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s one of those things that happens when you&#39;re working with students, who are doing five courses, plus this for love,&quot; said Dr. Thacher, the team&#39;s faculty adviser.</p> <p>Win or lose, the Sunrayce is only one of a number of other competitions that Clarkson has entered this year. Another team recently won a competition for all-terrain vehicles. And in April Clarkson took first place for a small-scale process to package chemical poisons contained in the sludge at the bottom of ponds at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver. The team put the sludge in recycled plastic.</p> <p>&quot;Hazardous waste disposal doesn&#39;t get the same press as solar racing,&quot; said Dr. Powers, the adviser to the hazardous waste team. &quot;We&#39;re trying to figure out why.&quot;</p>
619871>New York&#39;s Natural Gas-Powered Fleet to Grow by 240 Hoping to tempt other fleet operators to follow suit, Mayor David N. Dinkins announced yesterday that 30 percent of the non-emergency cars, vans and small trucks that the city buys in the next year will be built to run on natural gas. Lucius J. Riccio, the commissioner of transportation, said the reason was that New York was choking on automobile emissions.  <p>&quot;Not only do we have this addiction to the automobile but we have this addiction to such a polluting fuel,&quot; said Mr. Riccio. He spoke at a conference of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, a nationwide organization that is holding its annual meeting at the New York Hilton this week.  More Than 800</p> <p>&quot;We hope to prime the pump, jump start the idea,&quot; said Mr. Riccio, with the aim of demonstrating to the owners of private fleets of cars and trucks that natural gas, which emits far less pollution, is &quot;a viable fuel.&quot; But the city&#39;s own fleet is significant; as of June 1 it had 24,021 vehicles, of which about 13,000 are light-duty vehicles: cars, vans and light trucks.</p> <p>The 240 vehicles the city will buy, combined with almost 600 others that have been or will be converted from gasoline use, will give the city more than 800 natural gas-powered vehicles by the end of next year. The city is already the largest municipal operator of natural gas vehicles in the nation, according to city officials, and may eventually use natural gas to fuel all its vehicles, including police cars and ambulances.</p> <p>Natural gas-powered vehicles can be refueled at a network of stations quietly forming around New York and Westchester, built by two local gas distribution companies, Brooklyn Union Gas and Consolidated Edison. The cost of the fuel varies but is generally lower than gasoline. For instance, Brooklyn Union prices its natural gas to be at least 15 percent less than gasoline.</p> <p>Con Ed has two stations in Westchester and one each in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Manhattan, and is building a new one on Gansevoort Street, in the West Village in Manhattan, exclusively for city vehicles; Brooklyn Union has 10 and will finish 5 more by the end of the year.</p> <p>The city is also hoping to stimulate demand for factory-built natural gas vehicles. The city did not say precisely what it would buy, but the selection from major manufacturers is now limited to a natural gas version of the Ford Crown Victoria, a Dodge van and a General Motors pickup. Mr. Riccio himself has had a natural gas-powered Crown Victoria, a full-size sedan, for three years. But he said he takes the subway most of the time.</p> <p>According to the city, the Dodge van emits 90 percent less carbon monoxide, 74 percent less nitrogen oxide and 96 percent less volatile organic compounds than the gasoline version. Carbon monoxide is a poison; the other two pollutants, together with bright sunlight, are the ingredients of smog.</p> <p>Converted vehicles also emit less pollution, but the drop is not as dramatic, the city&#39;s Transportation Department says.</p> <p>The vehicles that are built for natural gas will carry warantees from the big three auto makers. Even better would be a vehicle designed for natural gas from the ground up, which would mean redesigning the engine to get the most out of a fuel with an octane of 130, and building a chassis designed for the fuel cannisters, but no company has done that yet. Buses, Too</p> <p>The city is also buying 53 natural gas-powered buses, a quarter of the buses it will buy this year, for use by seven bus companies that it subsidizes in the city. The Transportation Department plans to buy 400 buses between 1997 and 2001 and is leaning toward making them all natural gas-powered, according to Mr. Riccio.</p> <p>Buying natural-gas buses costs an extra $30,000, or 15 percent more, while cars, vans and pickup trucks built for natural gas cost an extra $3,000. In both cases, officials believe the cost differential will decline as more vehicles are produced. And they say that maintenance costs for natural gas-powered vehicles are lower.</p>
681472>L.I. INQUIRY FINDS ERRORS, NOT SNOW, STOPPED RAILROAD The Long Island Rail Road&#39;s collapse of Feb. 11, which stranded tens of thousands of riders at their jobs in New York or on cold railroad platforms in Queens, was not caused by the 12-inch snowfall, but by shabby management, the Inspector General of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said in an unusually blunt report released yesterday. The report lists a cascading series of errors by management, dereliction of duty by low-level workers and a generally lackadaisical response by the railroad&#39;s two top executives.  <p>It also charges that the railroad&#39;s president, Charles W. Hoppe, did not tell the truth when he said the weather had prevented his return to New York from his home in Virginia, an allegation Mr. Hoppe vehemently denied yesterday.</p> <p>With better management, Inspector General Henry B. Flinter said, &quot;I believe the railroad would have been able to cope with this storm, and people would have gotten home.&quot;</p> <p>In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Flinter suggested that Mr. Hoppe and perhaps some subordinates should be dismissed. But the M.T.A. chairman, Peter E. Stangl, issued a statement standing by Mr. Hoppe and calling the breakdown &quot;an isolated incident.&quot; And Mr. Hoppe said that several steps recommended in the report had already been adopted.</p> <p>State Senator Norman J. Levy, a Long Island Republican and chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, called the report &quot;a devastating indictment of the total failure of leadership by the railroad&#39;s top executives,&quot; and he asked Mr. Stangl to meet with him on Monday to describe what actions he planned.</p> <p>Sheldon J. Schacter, chairman of the railroad&#39;s commuter council, said: &quot;It&#39;s clear that there have to be big-time changes at the railroad. I said privately weeks ago that people have to be fired, demoted and transferred.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Flinter&#39;s account of the events of Feb. 10 and 11 reads like a script for a disaster movie.</p> <p>Managers at the railroad ignored their computer links to a private weather forecasting service, for which the railroad pays $6,000 a year, and missed a 4 A.M. prediction that the snow would be a foot deep instead of 3 to 6 inches, the report said. Early that morning, a Friday, they were working from forecasts that were almost four hours old, the report said.</p> <p>Realizing the snow was getting deep and that they did not have trains running frequently enough to keep the tracks and the third rail clear, railroad managers decided to rely primarily on diesels, which could have plowed through snow too deep for electric trains. But the diesels were trapped in the yards because the switches there had not been cleared of snow, Mr. Flinter found.</p> <p>Workers were supposed to begin clearing the switches at 4 A.M. in Long Island City by lighting smudge pots and using other methods. But they apparently did not show up for work until 8 A.M., the report said. Their foreman claims they came at 5 and they found -- contrary to all evidence -- that it wasn&#39;t snowing yet. So, the foreman told investigators, &quot;he and his men stayed in the office and watched television for three hours.&quot;  No One Ordered Buses</p> <p>As conditions worsened, railroad executives decided at 9 A.M. to rely primarily on diesel service. But the first diesel train did not make its way out of the yard until 10:30.</p> <p>Things were hardly run better elsewhere, the report said. At Pennsylvania Station, the railroad failed to notice that thousands of commuters were getting off their trains and deciding to look for a train home immediately. Later the railroad advised riders to take the subway to Jamaica, where buses would be waiting, but no one at the railroad thought to order the buses.</p> <p>Mr. Hoppe, in a telephone interview, said, &quot;In modern times we have not experienced a storm in which we had people reversing themselves at 10:30 or 11 o&#39;clock in the morning when we&#39;re still bringing people in from the Island.&quot;</p> <p>The report said that Metro-North, a sibling agency under the M.T.A. that serves the northern suburbs, monitored the shift and thus was able to react quickly. Mr. Hoppe said that was because Metro-North has storage space in Grand Central Terminal, while his own railroad has hardly any at Pennsylvania Station. Accused of Being Untruthful</p> <p>As the storm progressed, the railroad, which carries 100,000 commuters in each direction on a typical day, simply stopped running.</p> <p>The report accuses Mr. Hoppe of being untruthful about why he did not return to the railroad&#39;s Jamaica headquarters from his home in Arlington, Va., on Thursday night or Friday morning. Mr. Hoppe spends most weeknights at his apartment on Long Island, the railroad said.</p> <p>Mr. Hoppe said that his Virginia street was impassable and that he was more useful staying at home and remaining in constant phone contact. But Mr. Flinter said that interviews with the police, taxi companies, a letter carrier and neighbors of Mr. Flinter showed that less than half an inch of precipitation had fallen in the storm and that the street was passable. Investigators also found that the Washington-area subway was running and that between Thursday and Saturday, 36 Amtrak trains ran from Washington to New York.</p> <p>Also, Mr. Flinter said, Mr. Hoppe could have stayed in contact during the trip with his cellular telephone.</p> <p>&quot;The public has a right to expect that a public official, certainly one at Mr. Hoppe&#39;s level, will not only make a contribution during a time of crisis, but, most importantly, will give an accurate and honest account of his actions,&quot; the report said.  Dispute About Home Street</p> <p>But Mr. Hoppe was adamant that an ice storm had made his street impassable; from his window he could see an unbroken crust of snow and ice, he said, and none of his neighbors had moved their cars. Mr. Hoppe had gone to Washington to consult with Federal officials about a threatened strike. Of Mr. Flinter and the investigators, he said, &quot;I was there; they weren&#39;t.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;What you don&#39;t do in this business is make some heroic, symbolic movement and get out of position where you can communicate with people,&quot; he said. Amtrak, he said, was vulnerable to breakdown in an ice storm.</p> <p>He added that he resented having his honesty impugned.</p> <p>Jack Rousseau, the head of the train engineers&#39; union at the railroad, said Mr. Hoppe should take much of the blame for the way the railroad performed in the storm, but he added, &quot;I&#39;ve dealt with this guy many times, and we&#39;re not at all on same side of many issues, but there&#39;s no way that he&#39;s a liar.&quot; Groundwork for Disaster</p> <p>Mr. Hoppe laid the groundwork for the catastrophe months earlier, Mr. Flinter said, by separating responsibility for engineering activities from the other operating departments. Mr. Hoppe was using &quot;a unique theory of management,&quot; Mr. Flinter said in a telephone interview.</p> <p>Mr. Hoppe defended the decision as a way to improve service by consolidating all customer service activities under one department, and infrastructure and capital improvement areas under another. And, he said, the structure was working.</p> <p>Mr. Flinter, who was previously the inspector general at the Javits Convention Center, added that managers were not focused on the problem. A vice president who could have taken charge early and prevented catastrophe, John Bennett, instead continued with meetings that were unrelated to the storm, he said. But Mr. Hoppe, in a statement, praised both Mr. Bennett and the other vice president who shares operating responsibility.</p> <p>Mr. Stangl, the chairman of the M.T.A., who hired Mr. Hoppe, appears ready to stand by him. Mr. Stangl said in a statement that the disruption was &quot;an isolated incident and should not overshadow the record of steady progress the railroad has made in improving service over the last several years under Chuck Hoppe.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Hoppe, 58, a longtime railroad consultant in Virginia, became president of the railroad in 1990.</p>
201337>Reports Back Alternative for Bomb Fuel Seizing a nuclear reactor from a utility company and converting it to make tritium for use in bombs, as envisioned in an executive order signed Friday by President Reagan, presents no serious technical obstacles and appears to be substantially faster than building a new military tritium producer, according to two studies done last year by the Department of  <p>Seizing a nuclear reactor from a utility company and converting it to make tritium for use in bombs, as envisioned in an executive order signed Friday by President Reagan, presents no serious technical obstacles and appears to be substantially faster than building a new military tritium producer, according to two studies done last year by the Department of Energy.</p> <p>The studies explored buying an unfinished civilian reactor on the Government&#39;s nuclear reservation at Hanford, Wash., and modifying it to make tritium or plutonium. But the research can also be viewed as a blueprint for taking over an existing reactor of the same design as the one at Hanford and loading it with new fuel that would be turned to tritium when irradiated inside the reactor.</p> <p>The nation&#39;s only plant for making tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen that is the fuel for thermonuclear bombs, was shut down in August because of safety and management problems. Inefficient But Still Useful</p> <p>The studies contemplated a period of nearly five years to make the necessary special fuel and target elements, material like a special lithium that becomes tritium when struck by neutrons, but that period was timed to coincide with the slowest process, completing construction on the plant. In an emergency, making the fuel and target elements could probably be accelerated, experts say, and some existing Government facilities could be converted for that purpose.</p> <p>Engineers at the Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, two manufacturers of commercial nuclear reactors, said yesterday that a reactor could be converted into an inefficient but still useful tritium producer in a matter of months.</p> <p>The two studies of Washington Public Power Supply System plant 1, a 1,250-megawatt reactor, were completed last year. The plant, designed by Babcock &amp; Wilcox, was brought to 63 percent of completion at a cost of $2.5 billion, which is still being paid by electric consumers in the Pacific Northwest.</p> <p>According to a study released in February 1987, conversion of the plant &#39;&#39;is feasible and attractive,&#39;&#39; and production of tritium could begin in five years, as against the 10 to 12 years needed to build a new plant, and would cost billions of dollars less. The studies were undertaken as concern was rising about the poor condition of the three reactors that the Government now uses to make tritium at its Savannah River Plant, near Aiken, S.C., but before those plants were shut. Choice of Company</p> <p>The plan is still under consideration, but the Department of Energy has said that it would prefer to build a new reactor. The study does not address taking over an operating civilian plant in a national emergency, as the executive order on Friday appears to authorize. Nor does it suggest that Babcock &amp; Wilcox reactors, of which there are eight, are better suited than the 107 reactors of different designs now licensed to operate. Babcock &amp; Wilcox, which designed the Three Mile Island plant at Middletown, Pa., appears to have been chosen because of the existence of the mothballed construction project near the military complex at Hanford.</p> <p>Using a reactor initially designed for civilian use could represent a safety improvement over existing reactors, the February study said. It pointed out that the Washington reactor has a containment building designed to hold in the radioactive material in case of an accident. The Department of Energy&#39;s existing production reactors do not.</p> <p>A conversion also creates the hazard that after a fuel melting accident of the kind that occured at Three Mile Island, an uncontrollable nuclear reaction could spontaneously resume in the reactor vessel as a molten pool of enriched uranium formed.</p> <p>But an August 1988 study said that such a hazard exists at other military plants. &#39;&#39;Recent studies have indicated that there are viable solutions,&#39;&#39; the report said.</p> <p>The physics of producing tritium would be similar in a civilian or a military plant. In both cases, a special type of lithium would be exposed to neutrons, the sub-atomic particles that are released when radioactive atoms are split and which carry on the nuclear reaction by going on to split additional atoms. The neutrons would break apart the litium atoms into one atom of helium and one of tritium, a form of hydrogen with two extra neutrons.</p> <p>But the process would not be as efficient in a civilian reactor as it is in a military one.</p>
697616>Buying Air-Conditioners: An Environmental Guide A SHOPPER went to a discount store, Tops Appliance City, in East Hanover, N.J., earlier this month to look for a window air-conditioner. He made a tentative selection, a $700 model, and then asked if the machine used Freon, the Du Pont trade name that is commonly used to refer to chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC&#39;s, the chemicals blamed for eating a hole in the ozone layer. Yes, the salesman said, and the machines are notorious for leaking, he added, so buy our service contract, too, for $149.  <p>Well, said the shopper, do you have any that don&#39;t use Freon?</p> <p>Oh, sir, said the salesman, you wouldn&#39;t want one of those, because the replacement refrigerant corrodes the machine&#39;s innards. Buy the service contract instead, he said again.</p> <p>What&#39;s an environmentally conscious shopper to do?</p> <p>First, stop listening to the salesman.</p> <p>&quot;The salesman is flat-out wrong&quot; about the refrigerant used in air-conditioners, said T. R. Reid, a spokesman for the Whirlpool Corporation in Benton Harbor, Mich., which produces window units under the Whirlpool, Kitchenaid, Roper and Kenmore brand names.</p> <p>(On Monday, the Tops store manager said someone from company headquarters would respond. No one did.)</p> <p>No window units use CFC&#39;s like Freon. Instead, they use a compound called R-22, part of a class of chemicals called HCFC&#39;s. HCFC&#39;s do some ozone damage, but at the moment, no one markets a completely ozone-friendly window air-conditioner, so the only alternative is to swelter.</p> <p>With a warm spring and a reasonably strong economy, the industry expects to sell more than three million window air-conditioners this year, all using R-22, and nearly all of that refrigerant will eventually be vented into the atmosphere, either because the machines leak or because they break down and are dumped in landfills.</p> <p>For now, buy whatever you can find in the stores, because window air-conditioners are not prone to leak, at least not in the first decade or so.</p> <p>Window air-conditioners are not as big a problem as cars. The 1994 cars and many of the 1993&#39;s use a new refrigerant called R-134a, which does not hurt the ozone layer; older models use R-12, which persists in the atmosphere for decades and breaks down stratospheric ozone molecules that protect life on the earth&#39;s surface from the sun&#39;s ultraviolet rays.</p> <p>Car air-conditioners are prone to leak: they are powered by a belt from the engine, which spins a shaft, and the seal around the shaft gradually breaks down. In addition, car air-conditioners must be free to bounce and vibrate, so they use hoses instead of pipes, and the hoses leak, too. But production of R-12 will be banned after this year, and repairing air-conditioners, expensive now, will become harder and harder.</p> <p>Window air-conditioners are more durable because the motors and spinning shafts are inside a sealed box. Most have a life span of 12 to 15 years.</p> <p>But the refrigerant they use, R-22, is scheduled to be phased out, too. Almost all production will stop in 2020. According to the air-conditioning industry, R-22 does only 5 percent as much damage as R-12.</p> <p>Not everyone agrees that R-22 is acceptable even in the short-term. John W. Passacantando, the executive director of Ozone Action, a Washington environmental group, said that in the next few decades, R-22 will have an impact much larger than 5 percent, maybe 20 or 25 percent.</p> <p>The 5 percent figure, he said, was based on damage over the next 200 years, but the most intense period of ozone destruction will occur much sooner, in the next century. Industry executives do not agree, but they anticipate that the current phase-out for R-22 will be accelerated. Thus they all have replacements on the drawing boards or ready to mass-produce.</p> <p>The problem is that an air-conditioner using R-134a, if it were the same size as current units, would be 30 percent less efficient, said A. Bruce Buchholz, the vice president for window air-conditioners at the Carrier Corporation in Syracuse. At the same time, the United States Department of Energy is proposing regulations to make all air-conditioners more efficient. Manufacturers can make window units more efficient by adding more coils, but that makes them bigger, noisier and costlier.</p> <p>So the industry, along with the chemical companies that make the refrigerants, is still looking for a better substitute than R-134a.</p> <p>Companies that make dehumidifiers, which have traditionally used R-12, are switching to R-22 because it won&#39;t be banned until 2020, said Robert J. Laurent, a spokesman for the Fedders Corporation in Peapack, N.J.</p> <p>Carrier, a United Technologies subsidiary, has built a window unit that runs on R-134a and is ready to mass-produce it, but for the European market. &quot;In Europe a room air-conditioner sells for double what it does in the U.S.,&quot; Mr. Buchholz said. &quot;There&#39;s a margin to work with there.&quot;</p> <p>Whole-house air conditioners also run on R-22, but Carrier introduced a model earlier this year that runs on R-134a. Size is generally not a consideration in whole-house models, because the machinery is outdoors.</p> <p>Buying a whole-house unit that runs on R-134a would be better for the environment, but people who buy units that use R-22 will probably be able to find refrigerant for as long as the air-conditioners last, at least under the current phase-out schedule. That puts a ceiling on production beginning in 1996 and cuts production to 65 percent by 2004, to 35 percent in 2010 and to 10 percent in 2015.</p>
790059>Group Sees Ozone Danger In Illicit Chemical Trade As the deadline approaches for the United States to stop making almost all ozone-destroying refrigerants for domestic use, a private group is estimating that up to 22,000 tons a year, or one-third the amount sold in this country, is smuggled in. The Federal Government has no current estimate of the amount of the chemicals, most of them chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC&#39;s, entering the country illegally. But last year officials said it was about 10,000 tons.  <p>Under an international agreement intended to limit the damage to Earth&#39;s protective ozone layer, the production of CFC&#39;s is limited by quotas. The agreement, the Montreal Protocol of 1987, will ban the production of CFC&#39;s for most uses in developed countries at the end of this year. It will allow developing countries to continue production for 10 more years.</p> <p>The ozone layer in the stratosphere protects people, plants and animals against damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun. The deterioration of the ozone layer, many scientists say, will increase the incidence of skin cancers and other radiation-related diseases.</p> <p>The private group, Ozone Action, said on Thursday that a new pattern of international trade was developing, with the United States exporting more CFC&#39;s to developing countries while material produced abroad was illicitly brought into this country.</p> <p>Exports from the United States are legal. The producers argue that they are even desirable, because they will forestall countries like India and China from building their own factories, which they might not shut down when their deadline arrives in 2005, said David J. Stirpe, a spokesman for the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy, an industry group.</p> <p>Smuggling CFC&#39;s into the United States means that no duties or excise taxes are paid. The illegal shipments could also mean that the total use of CFC&#39;s in the United States exceeds the quota set by the Montreal Treaty, but that cannot be determined.</p> <p>Ozone Action said CFC&#39;s were being smuggled from Russia and other countries in the former Soviet Union to avoid paying charges of almost $6 a pound. The group said that a 30-pound cylinder that costs $70 in Europe is sold in the United States for $242. If 22,000 tons were smuggled in yearly, the group said, the duties and excise taxes lost would amount to more than $200 million.</p> <p>Thomas A. Watts-FitzGerald, an Assistant United States Attorney in Miami who has prosecuted several CFC smuggling cases, said in a telephone interview that there was an informal consensus among Government officials last year that about 10,000 tons of CFC&#39;s were smuggled into the country every year. He said the quantity had probably declined because of recent prosecutions.</p> <p>On Friday, the United States Attorney in Miami, Kendall Coffey, said two dealers in the chemicals, Robert Pennell, 50, of Ronkonkoma, L.I., and Sam Alfano, 63, of Plantation, Fla., had pleaded guilty to importing the material without the required permits. They face a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail and fines of $8.8 million. In another case this year, Jose Prieto of Hialeah, Fla., was convicted of importing CFC&#39;s without permits and Paul J. Zborovsky of Cape Coral, Fla., pleaded guilty.</p> <p>The material seized from smugglers is given to the Defense Department, which stockpiles it for use in older equipment, said John Passacantando, executive director of Ozone Action. Older equipment cannot use the less damaging chemicals intended to replace CFC&#39;s.</p> <p>The level of smuggling is very important to the health of the ozone layer, Mr. Passacantando said, as the scientific studies that led to the Montreal Protocol&#39;s limits on ozone production &quot;all assumed 100 percent compliance&quot; with the quotas and other limits set for each country.</p> <p>Ozone Action&#39;s study, by Jim Vallette, a specialist in world trade, was based on conversations with distributors and scrutiny of shipping records around the world. In releasing its report, the group criticized American manufacturers for plans to continue producing CFC&#39;s for export to developing countries, which the Montreal accord allows them to do until 2005. If all worldwide production for export stopped, the group said, identifying smuggled CFC&#39;s in this country would be simple; everything found in active commerce would be illegal.</p> <p>Ozone Action is pushing for an earlier end to the manufacture of CFC&#39;s because the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently found record levels of ozone depletion in the Northern Hemisphere. Mr. Passacantando said the solution to that problem would be to phase out CFC&#39;s more quickly. &quot;Legally produced CFC&#39;s destroy ozone just as efficiently as illegal ones,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But Congress may be headed in another direction. The House Science Subcommittee on Energy and Environment has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday on whether scientists have overstated the case for damage to the ozone layer by CFC&#39;s.  The first witness is scheduled to be Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, who has introduced legislation that would repeal the section of the Clean Air Act that implements the ban on CFC production for domestic use at the end of the year.</p> <p>After CFC&#39;s are emitted, they take about three years to reach the stratosphere, where they begin destroying the protective ozone layer, said Dr. Jerry D. Mahlman, one of the Government&#39;s chief atmospheric scientists. Dr. Mahlman said the peak of ozone destruction was still on the way. If smuggling is significant, he said, it could delay the expected drop in CFC levels in the stratosphere.</p>
257935>Voters, in a First, Shut Down Nuclear Reactor Residents of Sacramento, Calif., voted Tuesday to shut down their utility&#39;s only nuclear power plant, the first time voters have decided to close a working reactor.  <p>The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the public agency that owns the Rancho Seco plant, promptly began shutting it down yesterday after the nuclear industry&#39;s $580,000 campaign to keep it open had failed to overcome arguments based less on the environment and safety than on economics: the troubled plant could not provide electricity at competitive cost.</p> <p>The vote, by which the utility district&#39;s board had agreed to abide, was 53.4 percent to shut the plant and 46.6 percent to keep it open. That outcome was a setback for an already depressed industry that hopes for a rebirth springing from an increased demand for electrical power in much of the United States and growing concern over the environmental effects of the burning of fossil fuels.</p> <p>The reactor, 25 miles from Sacramento, was built at a cost of $375 million. It has operated fitfully during its 15-year history, producing less than 40 percent of the electricity that would have resulted from unfailing year-round operation and requiring the utility district to double its rates over the last four years to pay for improvements.</p> <p>Opponents of the plant, including two members of the district&#39;s five-member board, argued that despite $400 million in new investment in the last three years, it would be far cheaper to retire it now, halfway through its expected life span, and buy power from neighboring utilities in the California market, which is glutted with electricity.</p> <p>Edward A. Smeloff, one of the board members who favored the shutdown, said the utility district was leaning toward &#39;&#39;1970&#39;s technology&#39;&#39; to replace the reactor: the installation of boilers fired by natural gas to drive Rancho Seco&#39;s existing steam turbines.</p> <p>The fuel cost of using natural gas to generate electricity is about 2.3 cents a kilowatt-hour, Mr. Smeloff said, and for most hours of the day neighboring utilities will sell electricity to Sacramento at fuel cost plus 15 percent. Last year, by comparison, nuclear-generated power from Rancho Seco cost 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour.</p> <p>In addition to the Rancho Seco plant, the utility owns two geothermal plants, a small solar installation and a plant fired by fossil fuels. But now that Rancho Seco is closing down, the district will be buying more than half its power from neighboring utilities. Backdrop of Safety Concern</p> <p>Although the vote Tuesday centered on economics, it took place against a backdrop of nationwide concern over the safety of nuclear power plants in general, and of local concern over particular problems at Rancho Seco. The reactor&#39;s design is nearly identical to that at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, where a severe core-melting accident occurred in March 1979, and Rancho Seco has had accidents of its own.</p> <p>One of these occurred in March 1978, when a worker caused a partial blackout in the control room by dropping a light bulb behind a control panel. The result was to trigger emergency systems that dumped huge volumes of cold water into the hot reactor vessel, creating a danger of cracking.</p> <p>To a greater extent, however, the vote was a popular repudiation of the conventional wisdom about nuclear plants: that they may be expensive to build but, once running, make electricity cheaply. In fact, utility industry statistics now show that the continuing expense of operation, maintenance and fuel is higher for reactors than for coal-fired plants.</p> <p>Opponents of nuclear power, who have lost 14 similar referendums in 10 states during the last 13 years, took heart from the Sacramento outcome. &#39;&#39;This sends a message, a shot heard round the world,&#39;&#39; said Scott Denman, director of the Safe Energy Communication Council. &#39;&#39;This revitalizes and reinvigorates the whole consumer and rate-payer movement with regard to nuclear power.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The vote was 111,867 in favor of the shutdown and 97,460 opposed, with about 40 percent of registered voters casting ballots. Atomic-power opponents said they had benefited from the fact that all those voting were neighbors of the plant and customers of the utility; in recent defeats for shutdown proposals in Maine and Massachusetts, some voters distant from the reactors were unaffected by the issue of cost. The Industry&#39;s Outlook</p> <p>Advocates of atomic power have asserted that looming electricity shortages in the East and increased concern over coal burning&#39;s contribution to global warming offer an opportunity for new reactors.</p> <p>But because of local opposition the industry is also fast approaching the abandonment of the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island. In addition, the Public Service Company of Colorado announced recently that it would abandon its Fort St. Vrain reactor, which, like Rancho Seco, ran poorly.</p> <p>These developments, combined with Tuesday&#39;s vote, raise the possibility that the American nuclear power industry reached its high-water mark recently, at 112 operable reactors, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave Seabrook, in New Hampshire, a license for low-power testing.</p> <p>But at the Council for Energy Awareness, the industry&#39;s trade association, Scott Peters, a spokesman, said that while the Sacramento vote was unfortunate, &#39;&#39;we don&#39;t think this interrupts our progress.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It doesn&#39;t do anything for the supply problems we seem to be facing in many sections of the country, and it doesn&#39;t do anything for pollution,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It worsens pollution.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The future of Rancho Seco itself is uncertain. The plant cannot be dismantled until a place is found for its spent fuel. The Department of Energy is studying a site in Nevada, at Yucca Mountain, which would be a repository for the highly radioactive wastes of all the nation&#39;s nuclear plants. But even the most optimistic projections are that no repository can be ready before the early years of the next century.</p>
685514>Companies Resist Rules On Driving The Federal Government is trying to control the way people travel to work, seeking to reduce pollution, congestion and energy use by limiting the number driving alone in cars. But to reduce the solitary nature of confinement behind the wheel, the Government is relying on employers, and the employers are screaming about it. Soon, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and seven other states will require big employers to take such steps as reporting to the Government on how their workers get to work from home, and filing plans for reducing the number who drive alone, by inducing them to switch to car pools or public transportation. If the companies fail they can be liable for tens of thousands of dollars in fines per day.  <p>Environmentalists say the air will never be clean as long as there are more and more cars clogging the roads, and that this program, variously called Employee Trip Reduction or the Employee Commute Option by Federal and state governments, is one of the few governmental tools for reducing the rise in total mileage. Broader steps, like higher gasoline taxes or tolls on bridges that are now free, are unlikely because they are so unpopular, they say. For Some, &#39;a Terrible Idea&#39;</p> <p>But some employers say they find the program onerous nonetheless. &quot;This is pretty much a terrible idea,&quot; said Brendan Sexton, who is in charge of compliance with Government mandates for the Rockefeller Group, which manages Rockefeller Center. He said it is probably impossible to achieve the goals but &quot;even fully implemented, it has limited potential.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Sexton also said that if employees cannot choose the means of transportation they think is most convenient, it will further erode the competitive position of New York City as a place to do business; other executives say the same of their areas.</p> <p>Even some government officials show limited enthusiasm. &quot;If you asked me to develop a hierarchy of programs, this one would not be at the top of the list,&quot; said Conrad Simon, director of the Air and Waste Management Division of the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s New York regional office. But the program is the law and it will help, he said.</p> <p>Under Employee Trip Reduction, the Government has calculated how many people arrive per private car in each jurisdiction, which may be a borough or a county or two. Employers are supposed to switch enough workers to other modes of transport so they exceed the average by 25 percent. For Manhattan, where most commuters arrive by train or bus, the target is 7.81 people per car; in the rest of New York City it is 2.4 people per car, and in the suburban counties of New York, similar to Connecticut and New Jersey, the target is 1.5 people per car, which would mean that, on average, every other car would have a second person.</p> <p>The law, called the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, has been around since 1990 but because of delays by state legislatures and by state and Federal regulatory authorities, only California has a program in operation. Other states -- Delaware, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois and Texas -- are only now issuing regulations that require action by the companies. New York published its regulations on April 6, and affected companies, those with 100 or more employees arriving at a work site between 6 A.M. and 10 A.M., have until June 6 to register.</p> <p>Few employers in the metropolitan area have taken steps beyond registering and conducting surveys; many have not done that yet. Governments have taken some steps that will help the employers, however; there are new car pool-only lanes on the Long Island Expressway, the Queensboro Bridge and Interstate 80 in New Jersey. In some locations, governmental agencies have started bus or van service between suburban office parks and train stations. In addition, the Federal tax law has changed, requiring some companies that give employees parking as a benefit report the value of that space on W-2 forms as taxable income. No Quid Pro Quo</p> <p>Some companies have asked state regulators if they can avoid the requirements by making other environmental improvements; for example, Star Recycling Inc., in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, asked if it could volunteer to convert its heavy diesel trucks to cleaner-burning natural gas. But the law has no trading provisions, regulators say.</p> <p>Some companies may try to avoid regulation by laying off a few workers or shifting them to another location, to keep the total at any one site below 100. Others may shift the starting times of some workers to after 10 A.M., the hour at which the morning rush hour ends, under the law. All of those would sidestep the intent of the law, according to Government officials. But other measures would be encouraged, like shifting workers to four 10-hour days instead of five eight-hour days, or letting employees work from home perhaps once a week.</p> <p>The laws inject business into an area they never had to pay attention to before: how workers get to their jobs.</p> <p>Opponents say it is arithmetically impossible for the program to make much difference, even if it achieves its goals. C. Kenneth Orski, president of the Urban Mobility Corporation, a Washington transportation consulting firm, said commuting trips make up a quarter of all trips, and that companies employing more than 100 people at a single site represent only 40 percent of commuters. Thus, he said, the regulation affects only about 10 percent of daily trips.</p> <p>If among that 10 percent the number of passengers per car increased by one-fourth, that would mean cutting out only 2 to 3 percent of the cars, Mr. Orski said, but he cited a recent report to Congress by the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency that predicted the reduction in traffic would be only about 1 percent.</p> <p>Mr. Orski spoke last week at a symposium at the annual meeting of the Regional Plan Association in New York. His presentation raised sympathetic comments from many business executives in the audience, including Mr. Sexton.  Unclogging Rush Hour</p> <p>Supporters say, however, that the goal is not so much to reduce the number of cars on the road on average, but the number at rush hour. Even a small decrease will make traffic flow more smoothly, they say, and with less congestion there will be less air pollution, even if the number of miles driven did not change much.</p> <p>And Mr. Simon of the E.P.A. said in a telephone interview that 1 percent was not so bad. &quot;Unless you do Draconian measures, like banning vehicles on alternate days of the week, you are going to find most of the measures available are going to give you only 1 or 2 percent,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But Mr. Orski suggested that as an alternative, states try &quot;episodic controls,&quot; which could become the summer equivalent of snow emergency routes, taking effect only in extreme weather conditions. In this case, special rules might be put into effect when weather conditions favored formation of ozone. Last year New York had 11 &quot;ozone exceedances,&quot; days in which the ozone level exceeded Federsal standards, he pointed out, but the rules would be in effect every workday of the year.</p> <p>Another critic, Michael J. Critelli, chief executive of Pitney Bowes Credit Corp., of Stamford, predicted that if the rules succeeded in reducing rush-hour congestion, then traffic would flow more smoothly and trucks, some of which now avoid being on the road at rush hour, would return, and the net effect would be zero.</p> <p>In addition, Mr. Critelli, speaking at the same Regional Plan Association conference, which was at the New York Sheraton Hotel, said he had arrived that day by train from Stamford, but that he reached the train station from his home by car. Under the rules, he would be counted as arriving by mass transit, but, he said, the eight-mile drive to Stamford released a significant amount of pollution. A relatively large amount of pollution is released in the first two miles of any trip, before pollution-control equipment has time to heat up to operating temperature.</p> <p>The law extends the Clean Air Act to thousands of companies that had little contact with it before. In New York the rules affect over 7,000 worksites. In New Jersey it is about 5,800, and in southwestern Connecticut, the only portion of that state that is covered, it is about 400. An open question for employers is what it will cost.</p> <p>In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut employers will have to pay a filing fee when they register, a fee that varies according to the number of employees. In New York, the fees alone will come to $3.4 million.</p> <p>Robert P. Ancar, manager of the Employee Commute Options unit of the New York Department of Transportation, said studies put the average cost at a little over $100 per year per employee. A few have put the upper limit much higher; Mr. Orski cited one that said the cost per employee who gave up a car was $3,000 a year. Mr. Orski suggested that with $3,000 to spend, a company could cut far more pollution through other means, perhaps paying a bounty to people who agree to junk old cars with no working catalytic converters.</p> <p>But another expert, Carol Dee Angell, the president of Metropool, Inc., a company in Stamford that helps set up car pools suggested that the issue may not really be money. The real problem may be that employers structure jobs so that workers must have the flexibility that a single-passenger automobile provides.</p> <p>Employee Trip Reduction works, she said, &quot;when the boss is willing, and sends a clear message to middle-line managers, on things like no more 4 P.M. meetings.&quot; A meeting that runs past the normal quitting-time means that an employee will miss the car pool, she pointed out.</p>
1704823>In Bush&#39;s Trail, Scarred Ground When people refer to battlegrounds in presidential races, they are usually not thinking of airport runways. But those people probably have not heard of Runway 4/22 at the airport in Las Cruces, N.M. The runway, the airport&#39;s longest, has been closed since President Bush made a campaign stop in August 2004. It has gouges six inches deep and a hundred yards long, which the city says were put there by two Air Force cargo planes accompanying the president. Las Cruces put the damage at $2.1 million.  <p>The city said airport officials warned the Air Force that the planes, a giant C-17 and a military version of the 757, were too heavy, and that the hot asphalt would be too soft for landing that day.</p> <p>When Bill Clinton paid a presidential visit, he landed at Holloman Air Force Base nearby, said Terence J. Kelly, a spokesman for Las Cruces. When Senator John Kerry and former Senator John Edwards, the Democratic candidates for president and vice president, visited, &#39;&#39;they landed elsewhere,&#39;&#39; Mr. Kelly said.</p> <p>After a year of discussions, the Air Force has offered $600,000 for repairs.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s open to dispute whether it was nice and pretty to begin with,&#39;&#39; said Maj. Ann Stefanek of the Air Force.</p> <p>Major Stefanek said the Air Force was acknowledging the damage but denying that it was warned before the landing.</p> <p>The Las Cruces City Council may discuss the settlement offer next month.</p>
1806335>Airlines Brace for Annual Crush The official prediction for Thanksgiving air travel is that the airports will be crowded with people who are unfamiliar with the rules on carry-on liquids, that the system for checked bags will be subject to a double whammy and that nobody is quite clear about the status of leftover cranberry sauce. The major carriers&#39; trade group, the Air Transport Association, said Thursday that it expected 25 million travelers from Friday to Nov. 28, up about 3 percent from the corresponding period last year. The strain on baggage checking is likely to be even greater than the number alone implies, however, since restrictions on carry-on liquids, adopted in August as a security step, mean fliers are more likely to check bags than they were a year ago.  <p>That will not mean easier going at security checkpoints, though. Frequent fliers are aware of those rules, which limit carry-on liquids, aerosols and gels to three-ounce containers, all of which must fit comfortably in a clear one-quart plastic bag that travelers will be asked to put in a screening bin, along with their shoes, at the checkpoint. But because many Thanksgiving travelers fly only once or twice a year, screenings are expected to take longer than usual.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If you have a plane with 200 passengers and it takes an extra 30 seconds for each passenger to go through, multiply 30 seconds times 200 people and you&#39;re talking about over an hour and a half,&#39;&#39; Gregory O. Principato, president of the Airports Council International-North America, said at a news conference with counterparts from the Air Transport Association and the federal Transportation Security Administration.</p> <p>Travelers who forget plastic bags may find people handling them out at the airports. &#39;&#39;We&#39;ll have volunteers, docents, interns, airport staff,&#39;&#39; Mr. Principato said.</p> <p>Kip Hawley, chief of the Transportation Security Administration, said checkpoints would be fully staffed and would open early in an effort to keep lines short.</p> <p>Carry-on food, including leftovers, is welcome on planes, Mr. Hawley said. But the food must meet the liquids rule. And what is a liquid?</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If you dump it out on the table and it retains its form, &#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;it&#39;s not a liquid, aerosol or gel.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Since treating leftovers that way is not recommended, however, screeners will use their judgment, officials said.</p>
225418>Ohio Governor Orders State Workers Out of Uranium Plant The Governor of Ohio told the Federal Department of Energy yesterday that he had ordered state inspectors to leave the department&#39;s Fernald uranium plant because they might be exposed to elevated levels of radiation, even in offices.  <p>The action follows the Federal Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s discovery that one of its workers showed elevated levels of uranium in her urine for two days when she visited the plant in December. The level, 15 to 25 micrograms per liter, was characterized by a spokesman for the agency as being &#39;&#39;higher than normal, which warrants investigation,&#39;&#39; but not a reason for health concern.</p> <p>Gov. Richard F. Celeste sent a letter yesterday to Adm. James Watkins, who has been nominated to be Energy Secretary, saying that the urine test results were &#39;&#39;particularly disturbing&#39;&#39; because the Federal worker &#39;&#39;did not visit the production areas of the plant and could only have been exposed in offices or meeting areas.&#39;&#39; Verification of Tests Sought</p> <p>Westinghouse Materials Company of Ohio, which operates the plant for the Department of Energy, conducts regular urine tests of its employees. Governor Celeste, in his letter, called on the Department of Energy to pay for &#39;&#39;an independent verification of the testing procedure&#39;&#39; used for employees.</p> <p>He also called for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and state officials to evaluate safety conditions at the plant.</p> <p>Correspondence between the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy indicates that more than one visiting inspector showed signs of elevated uranium levels. But officials of Westinghouse and the Department of Energy said that the incident may reflect a measurement error at the laboratories used by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p> <p>About 1,200 people work at the Fernald plant, 20 miles northwest of Cincinnati. The plant makes ingots of uranium from liquid and gaseous forms of the element so it can be used in the government reactors that make materials for nuclear bombs and other purposes.</p> <p>The plant, which has been in use for 35 years, has a long history of uranium dust escaping into the environment, and government investigators are attempting to reconstruct its environmental history to determine the extent of the radiation exposure of people who live in the vicinity.</p> <p>Ohio has no inspector assigned to the plant, but state inspectors are regularly there to supervise its compliance with environmental regulations in cleaning up locations where chemical spills and nuclear contamination have happened.</p>
623009>Stubborn Forest Fires Hit Drought Areas Like a bad idea borrowed from California, stubborn fires are burning above and below the forest floor in the drought-afflicted areas of New York and New Jersey, wearing out firefighters, forcing state police to close smoky roads and stinging the eyes and noses of people living miles away. At West Point, where nearly 900 acres have burned, two Army Huey helicopters flew 150 missions yesterday to drop water on fires smoldering on inaccessible hillsides. Across the Hudson River at Camp Smith in Peekskill, a National Guard base, scores of volunteer firefighters plan to converge today to seal off a fire that has consumed at least 100 acres.  <p>In between, the New York State Police have intermittently closed Route 6 near the Bear Mountain bridge because of smoke, and fire departments as far south as Yonkers and Mamaroneck have reported receiving calls from residents who smelled smoke.</p> <p>Both those fires are believed to have started accidentally, said Capt. Raymond A. Wood, regional forest ranger for the Department of Environmental Conservation. &quot;As hot as it was when the fires started, you would not be out in the woods unless you had to be,&quot; he said.  10 Days of Burning</p> <p>But in Brentwood, L.I., volunteer firefighters by yesterday had spent 10 days in a sweltering effort, so far unsuccessful, to extinguish a string of stubborn brush fires that they say must be the work of arsonists.</p> <p>The smoldering Long Island fires, using a six-inch layer of decayed pine needles and leaves on the forest floor as fuel, began July 6 east the Sagtikos Parkway in an area of the Pine Barrens, known as oak brush plains, that abuts residential neighborhoods.</p> <p>In New Jersey, 140 fires, most of them small, have been reported this month, state officials say. The largest covered 40 acres at the Atsion Recreation Area of the Wharton State Forest, in Burlington County.</p> <p>Stephen J. Maurer, a fire warden in the New Jersey Environmental Protection and Energy Department, said that because the fires had burrowed into the leaves and debris on the forest floor, it was hard to tell when they were really out. That means &quot;a number of people being there a lot longer than normal,&quot; he added.</p> <p>The fires at Camp Smith and elsewhere have not burned many trees, only the debris and peat that form the first few inches of the forest floor. Firefighters do not think the trees themselves are dry enough to catch fire. Waiting for Rain</p> <p>On Long Island, afternoon winds keep fanning embers back into flames, complained Lawrence E. Rex, chief of the Brentwood Fire Department. &quot;It just keeps on flaring up,&quot; he said.</p> <p>At Camp Smith, Chief Walter L. Groden, who is the fire coordinator for Westchester County, said: &quot;Short of a week of rain, there is no practical or economically feasible method of extinguishing this fire at this point.&quot;</p> <p>Camp Smith, a 2,000-acre installation owned by the state and used mostly for weekend guard training, is not part of any fire district and does not have a fire brigade of its own. Col. John A. Cusack, the commander, said that firefighters could build fire breaks to contain the fire but that it would burn &quot;until it consumes its own fuel, or it rains.&quot;</p> <p>The fires are the flip side of the floods in the Middle West; some of the rain that keeps falling in areas drained by the Mississippi River would in normal times be falling here, making the brush less fire-prone.</p> <p>Instead, the fires here this year are much more numerous and stubborn than usual, fire officials say, and are the worst since at least the summer of 1988, when a six-week hot spell set up similar conditions. Cutting Fire Roads</p> <p>All over, the firefighters have been hampered by terrain and distance from water supplies.</p> <p>On Long Island, bulldozers and what firefighters call brush trucks, specially equipped to make roads into the woods, have cut fire roads and scores of swaths through the woods, flattening hundreds of pitch pines and scrub oaks. Soda cans left by thirsty volunteers litter some areas. In others, freshly felled trees lying in the smoking humus have ignited, adding to firefighters&#39; woes.</p> <p>While no houses have been damaged by the fires, the smell of smoke hung over many neighborhoods, putting residents on edge. &quot;It&#39;s getting kind of scary,&quot; said Doris Valez, whose home on Princess Lane in Brentwood is bordered by a woods where firefighters fought a second brush fire yesterday. Chief Rex said that fire began when someone poured gasoline on a makeshift shack and set it ablaze.</p> <p>Several hundred firefighters from 20 volunteer departments on the Island fought the fires at their peak. Officials said 35 volunteers have suffered heat exhaustion, and 10 had to be taken to area hospitals.</p> <p>At West Point, 20 firefighters from the town of Highland Falls were working with 20 members of an Army engineering platoon. Not only does the terrain make access difficult in some areas, but one fire was burning in an area that is permanently off-limits because it is used as the &quot;impact area&quot; for artillery and other weapons, said Major Keith Trohoske, a spokesman. That fire was put out by dumping water from helicopters, he said.</p>
677485>EXPLOSION IN EDISON: The Pipeline; 7 Feet Underground, a Silent Superhighway Carries Enormous Energy Buried seven feet in the dirt next to an apartment complex in Edison, N.J., was the energy equivalent of a superhighway, a pipeline three feet across and filled with gas at a pressure of 900 pounds a square inch, sufficient to serve 10 million homes. To move that much energy by rail would take a carload of coal about every 30 seconds. The 33-year-old pipeline was supposed to be invisible forever, and it was at least unobtrusive. Survivors of the blast said yesterday that they never knew the pipeline was there, until they heard the blast or, in a few cases, heard a whooshing noise just before the explosion.  <p>What caused the pipeline to burst is not known, and a definite explanation may be weeks away.</p> <p>George Mazanec, vice chairman of the Panhandle Eastern Corporation, the energy conglomerate that owns the pipeline, said yesterday after a visit to the site that no drop in pressure had been detected before the explosion. Such a drop would have indicated impending disaster.</p> <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who cut short a vacation in Florida to return to New Jersey, said no one had found any signs of sabotage.</p> <p>Several Government agencies, including the National Transportation Safety Board, the same Federal agency that looks into airplane crashes, are investigating. The board is part of the Transportation Department, which has jurisdiction over pipelines.</p> <p>The pipeline that ruptured is part of an interlaced network that delivers gas from Texas and the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. It does not serve Edison or even New Jersey specifically, any more than does Interstate 287, which runs past the front of the apartment complex.  Major Transmission Company</p> <p>The pipeline is operated by the Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, which Panhandle Eastern acquired in 1989. Panhandle, the nation&#39;s second-largest gas transmission company, owns 26,000 miles of transmission mains, about 9 percent of the national total.</p> <p>The pipeline through Edison was constructed about 25 years before the apartment complex. A spokesman for Panhandle Eastern in Houston, Stewart Lawrence, said, &quot;All pipelines in that area run near residential areas.&quot;</p> <p>Mrs. Whitman was asked whether the line should have been that close to the homes of so many families. Mrs. Whitman, who was once the chief utility regulator for the state, replied that people lived near gas lines all over the country. This type of accident is highly unusual, she said.</p> <p>The explosion did not disrupt service in its system, Texas Eastern said. Two other pipelines, each 20 inches in diameter, parallel the one that broke.  With the heating season mostly over, peak demand in the Northeast has passed.</p> <p>Two and a half hours after the explosion and fire, workers closed valves on both sides of the break, one a few hundred yards away on Talmadge Road in Edison and the other five miles away, on the other side of Route 1, also in Edison.</p> <p>Panhandle Eastern has been involved in other blasts, including one in 1990 in Schoharie County that leveled 10 houses, killing two people and injuring four. Explosions in Kentucky and Louisiana in the mid-80&#39;s claimed 10 lives. The recent record of the company has been good, Federal regulators said.</p> <p>A member of the National Transportation Safety Board, John Lauber, said last night that his agency would review previous Texas Eastern incidents, including one in Kentucky that that state&#39;s fire marshal attributed to corrosion.</p> <p>There are about 285,000 miles of transmission mains around the country, and 1.5 million miles of all kinds of pipeline, including the gathering lines from well to well in the gas fields and the distribution lines that run down city streets.</p> <p>Transporting fuel by pipeline is far safer than other modes of carrying it, according to Federal statistics. In 1991 pipeline accidents caused 14 deaths, including 8 on a fishing boat that strayed outside a marked channel and hit a pipeline in shallow water. By contrast, accidents at railway grade crossings killed 602 people, and large trucks killed 650.</p> <p>Excavation work by contractors is the most common cause of pipeline leaks, and it is faulted in two-thirds of the incidents, although yesterday no one seemed to know of any such work in the immediate area. The remaining third, experts say, are incidences of corrosion, by water outside the pipe or chemicals inside.</p> <p>The industry calls damage to the pipe third-party damage, because it usually occurs when a contractor digging a foundation or installing another line hits a pipe. The Edison blast occurred near midnight, when construction is unlikely.</p> <p>But Michael German of the American Gas Association said: &quot;Sometimes a contractor comes in and is doing something that damages the pipe, then kind of fills it over and leaves without telling anybody. And several days later it could fail.&quot;</p> <p>The pipeline in Edison was made of steel .675 inches thick -- tough, industry experts said, but not impenetrable for a backhoe.</p> <p>Natural gas is only slightly lighter than air. So it dissipates slowly, unless there is a strong wind. When the gas has been diluted in air to a concentration of 5 to 15 percent a spark or an open flame will ignite it. The flame spreads quickly along the periphery of the gas.</p> <p>Correction:  March 26, 1994, Saturday</p> <p>An article yesterday about the investigation into the explosion of a natural gas pipeline in Edison, N.J., described the National Transportation Safety Board incorrectly. It is an independent Federal agency, not part of the Transportation Department.</p>
138139>Pact Could Aid Canada Energy Sales The proposed free trade agreement with Canada could provide an immediate spurt to natural gas sales in this country, by convincing potential gas users that larger reserves are available because neither country could reimpose restrictions, according to spokesmen for American gas producers and pipeline companies.  <p>That would be the largest short-term impact of the agreement in the energy field, according to American and Canadian experts. Over the long term, they say, the agreement would also stimulate American investment in Canadian oil and gas production, and increase sales of Canadian electricity, because of the promise of an end to restrictions on exports and imports established by both countries.</p> <p>Some American gas producers remain apprehensive, however, that the agreement could result in increased gas imports into an already depressed market. Hearings to Start</p> <p>The pact, signed Jan. 2 by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, is now under consideration by legislators in Washington and Ottawa. The Energy Committee of the Senate begins two days of hearings on the pact tomorrow.</p> <p>At present, with energy relatively cheap and plentiful, the two countries have few barriers to energy trade between them, but in times of shortage or of a large surplus, both sides have imposed restrictions.</p> <p>Robert A. Reinstein, who represented the United States in negotiations on the energy portion of the agreement, said that by assuring that Canada would be a steady supplier and the United States a steady customer, the agreement would encourage trade that requires long-term commitments, like gas purchases and long-term oil exploration projects.</p> <p>But, he noted, the short-term impact will be small, because &#39;&#39;trade between the United States and Canada is essentially free today.&#39;&#39; Mr. Reinstein added that this was the first trade agreement to deal specifically with energy.</p> <p>The agreement would leave intact a Canadian rule that oil drilling projects on land owned by Canada&#39;s Federal government continue to have a majority Canadian ownership. The American Petroleum Institute, a Washington-based trade organization, has complained about that provision but supports the agreement.</p> <p>The refiners&#39; group, the National Petroleum Refiners Association, has not taken a position. Some of the group&#39;s members would face stiffer competition under the free trade agreement, which would eliminate a duty of 1.25 cents on each gallon of gasoline imported. Benefit for Canada</p> <p>Canada would also benefit from a modification under the agreement of the United States law that prohibits the export of oil from Alaska, to allow 50,000 barrels a day to go to Canada&#39;s west coast. That is the limit of what refineries there can now accept, according to experts.</p> <p>Canada is the world&#39;s ninth-largest oil producer and third-largest gas producer, and provides about 5 percent of the United State&#39;s needs of both. Approval of the agreement is not expected to change the pattern of oil use in this country, which is already far in excess of domestic production. But natural gas marketers believe that consumption of their fuel is held down by fears of short gas supplies. At current rates of consumption, the United States would exhaust its gas supplies in about 11 years if no more gas is discovered.</p> <p>But Richard L. Itteilag, director of gas demand analysis at the American Gas Association, which primarily represents pipeline operators, said that Canada&#39;s proven reserves are nearly 100 trillion cubic feet, half again as large as the United States&#39; reserves. At current rates of consumption, Canada has a supply of more than 35 years.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Ultimately, this is another source of energy independence for the U.S.,&#39;&#39; Mr. Itteilag said at a conference on energy supply and trade organized by the International Research Center for Energy and Economic Development, in Boulder, Colo., earlier this month.</p> <p>The effect on the electricity market in the United States could be substantial in some areas. Less than 2 percent of the electricity consumed in this country comes from Canada, but according to the Department of Energy, the figure was 12 percent in New York and 9.2 percent in New England in 1986, and those numbers will grow.</p>
588788>Exxon President in Line To Be Next Chairman The Exxon Corporation said yesterday that it expected Lee R. Raymond to be elected chairman and chief executive in April, succeeding Lawrence G. Rawl, who will reach the mandatory retirement age of 65 in May. Mr. Raymond, 54, is a 30-year Exxon employee who became president of the company in 1987, when Mr. Rawl became chairman, and there was little surprise in the announcement.  <p>&quot;Unlike Mobil, where there were several strong contenders, in the case of Exxon there was only one,&quot; said George R. Friesen, an oil analyst at the Deutsche Bank Group. Promotion at Mobil</p> <p>The Mobil Corporation said yesterday that it had named Lucio A. Noto, its chief financial officer, to be president and chief operating officer. Analysts saw the promotion as a sign that Mr. Noto was the leading candidate to replace Mobil&#39;s chairman, Allen E. Murray, who will reach the mandatory retirement age of 65 next year.</p> <p>Exxon did break the mold with another appointment yesterday, however. The company said that Charles R. Sitter, 62, a senior vice president, would succeed Mr. Raymond as president. Mr. Sitter holds a master&#39;s degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and would be the first nonengineer to occupy one of the two top jobs at Exxon since L. D. Welch, a banker, was chairman from 1960 to 1963, according to Exxon officials.</p> <p>&quot;Maybe after the Valdez oil spill, they felt they needed someone a little more attuned to social and political currents,&quot; Mr. Friesen said.</p> <p>Mr. Raymond, a chemical engineer, joined Exxon in 1963 as a production research engineer and held a variety of jobs with the company in the Caribbean and Latin America. The company expects he will be elected at its annual meeting on April 28 in Houston.</p> <p>Exxon faces challenges on several fronts. It is one of the largest oil refiners in the United States, and the Clean Air Act of 1990 is bringing extensive changes to fuels in this country. And the company is the largest refiner in Europe, which is moving toward American fuel standards. These changes are likely to require billions of dollars in new investments, experts say. Competition From Exporters</p> <p>One analyst, Norman P. Higby Jr., a consultant in Menlo Park, Calif., said Exxon&#39;s biggest problem might be the move by big oil exporting countries into the &quot;downstream&quot; market of consuming countries. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Venezuela have all made large investments in the refining and marketing of gasoline in importing countries.</p> <p>&quot;Saudi Arabia can supply 50 percent of the U.S. market -- four million barrels of gasoline a day for 150 years -- and not raise their effective cost,&quot; Mr. Higby said. Competing with a marketer like that reduces the value of Exxon&#39;s own production apparatus to near zero, he said, adding that the problem was common to all the big oil companies doing business in this country.</p> <p>Exxon&#39;s shares gained 25 cents yesterday, closing at $62.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

811641>Solectria Says Car Passed Crash Test An advanced electric car with a body made of composite materials has passed the Federal crash test for head-on collisions, according to its manufacturer. The development is significant not only for the company, Solectria, of Wilmington, Mass., which hopes to mass-produce the cars, but also for the three major American car companies, which are cooperating to design a high-mileage, low-pollution car, one that is likely to be made of composites.  <p>The car, a four-passenger sedan called the Sunrise, broke a record in May when it went 238 miles on a single charge, in the Tour de Sol, an annual electric car race in the Northeast.</p> <p>The car, which has twin air bags, passed the standard 30-mile-an-hour head-on test, Solectria said. &quot;This full frontal crash test demonstrates that a comfortable high-performance electric vehicle comprised wholly of composite materials can provide a high degree of passenger safety,&quot; Mark Dockser, Solectria&#39;s vice president of planning and business development, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Dockser said the composite body had &quot;consistent and predictable&quot; results in tests on the components and on the whole vehicle.</p> <p>Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, in partnership with the Federal Government, are trying to develop a &quot;next-generation vehicle&quot; that would achieve a fuel economy of 80 miles per gallon of gasoline, or its equivalent in other fuels.</p> <p>Robert M. Chapman, the chairman of the partnership&#39;s technical task force, said today that passing the crash test was &quot;a very positive accomplishment.&quot;</p> <p>The partnership, which was formed two years ago and is still choosing which technologies to invest in, is seeking a 40 percent reduction in the weight of a  midsized vehicle, he said, and &quot;we recognize that to do so, we&#39;re going to have  to go to some advanced materials.&quot; Composite materials are usually made of strands of glass and carbon fiber that are embedded in a plastic or metal matrix.</p> <p>The Sunrise weighs 1,800 pounds, which is 500 pounds less than Solectria&#39;s previous car, an electric version of the Geo Metro called the Force. The Force,  which has a steel body, carries three people and goes less than half as far as the Sunrise.</p> <p>The Sunrise falls short of the goals for the next-generation vehicle, but appears to be creeping up on them. The Big Three want to see a car that goes from 0 to 60 miles an hour in 10 seconds, but the Sunrise, which is engineered for range, takes a sluggish 18 seconds. The next-generation car is supposed to go 380 miles on the highway on a single charge -- an optimistic estimate of the  range of a midsized car today -- compared with about 238 miles now for the Sunrise.</p> <p>But the 80-mile-per-gallon or equivalent goal has been met. The Sunrise carries an electrical equivalent of less than two gallons of gasoline, meaning its mileage exceeds 100 miles a gallon. And while some safety tests remain to be done, including tests on the defroster, Solectria believes the safety standards  are well within reach.</p> <p>The next-generation car is also supposed to cost about the same as a conventional car. Solectria believes that with enough orders -- about 20,000 a year -- it can produce its Sunrise competitively. But that depends on further cuts in the cost of batteries.</p>
496762>How an Old Government Reactor Managed to Outlive the Cold War THE last surviving piece of equipment for making nuclear fuel for the American arsenal, the 37-year-old K-Reactor, was designed to survive a one-megaton blast from a Soviet bomb at a range of two miles. But today environmentalists are more worried about a different kind of blast; they note that the outmoded reactor would not survive a far smaller internal explosion without dumping at least part of its radioactive entrails into the piney wetlands of western South Carolina. Last week the Secretary of Energy, James D. Watkins, said what had long been obvious: since the other big competitor in the nuclear arms race is giving up, much of the American bomb-production system is no longer needed. But as he spoke the K-Reactor, on the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C., was awakening from a three-and-a-half-year slumber to resume the production of tritium for bombs. Mr. Watkins said it would run as a backup until an alternate source was found. While the Energy Department was busy converting  <p>Last week the Secretary of Energy, James D. Watkins, said what had long been obvious: since the other big competitor in the nuclear arms race is giving up, much of the American bomb-production system is no longer needed. But as he spoke the K-Reactor, on the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C., was awakening from a three-and-a-half-year slumber to resume the production of tritium for bombs. Mr. Watkins said it would run as a backup until an alternate source was found. While the Energy Department was busy converting its mission from making weapons to dismantling and decontaminating its troubled bomb factories, Mr. Watkins reiterated that a new reactor may be in the wings.</p> <p>It was the latest in mixed signals as the Government tries to adapt its nuclear weapons complex to a new age. The Department of Energy has spent about $1 billion on re-opening the K-Reactor, one of five built in the early 1950&#39;s for the production of plutonium and tritium. The reactor was closed in 1988 because of safety problems. When department officials took reporters on a tour of the site earlier this month they said they planned to spend a billion more.</p> <p>To some extent the problem is simply inertia in what sometimes seems less a defense program than a public works project. The Savannah River Site, like most government nuclear reservations, dominates the economy of the surrounding region and has powerful political patrons.</p> <p>But the situation also reflects the Government&#39;s uncertainty about what the nuclear future holds. Given the delays the department has encountered in building plants far simpler than reactors -- for example, it recently built and abandoned a new factory for making submarine fuel, a few miles away -- officials seem determined to insure that no matter how many nuclear powers this country faces a decade from now, in the former Soviet Union or elsewhere, it will have a way to make tritium. This could be done with a new reactor or a particle accelerator, but for now the job is left to the coddled K-Reactor, which officials insist is safe since it will be run at only 30 percent power. Cleaning Up Wastes</p> <p>The K-Reactor is now dedicated solely to making tritium, which is used to enhance explosive yield, allowing for smaller, more maneuverable bombs. But tritium, like all radioactive elements, slowly decays. It is transformed at the rate of about 5.5 percent a year, meaning that even a shrinking arsenal will require tritium production eventually. Weapons in the field, or at least their tritium reservoirs, must be returned to Savannah River to be replenished.</p> <p>But with the cold war becoming a memory, some environmentalists are pushing to give up the plant, which lacks many modern safety features. Even in accident-free operation, they say, the reactor creates liquid wastes even more difficult to handle than those from civilian reactors, which are in solid form. The Energy Department chops up its fuel and dissolves it in acid to recover unused uranium and the plutonium.</p> <p>And tritium itself is nasty to deal with. The gas is so difficult to contain and so readily taken up by the body that visitors to the K-Reactor must &quot;provide bioassay samples&quot; (urinate in a cup), twice -- once before they enter and once when they leave.</p> <p>Some environmentalists say that as disarmament proceeds, it would be safer to scavenge tritium from retired warheads. A study recently completed for the Energy Research Foundation, a South Carolina environmental group, concluded that recycling could probably supply the remainder of the arsenal for about a decade. But the Energy Department wants a longer supply.</p> <p>Engineers have long been aware of the advancing age of the K-Reactor and the four similar reactors built nearby; one was permanently sidelined by a crack in the reactor vessel. In the late 1970&#39;s, when the plants were approaching what some already thought was the end of their useful lives, the Carter Administration cut back tritium production, believing that international tensions were easing. Then President Reagan embarked on a huge arms build-up, and the reactors began new production schedules. Through the 1980&#39;s, some in Congress fought for a new production reactor, but the department, still trying to get the most bang for the buck, delayed. Last Monday, Mr. Watkins said that a new reactor might be built, but that it would be smaller than previously planned.</p> <p>For now, though, the focus is still on the old plant, where in preparation for re-start, operators have completed a 1,000-hour training course, and have been divided into five platoons, enough to insure round-the-clock manning of the control room, vacations and days off, and one shift always in training. The plan is for the reactor to run until October 1992, when workers will remove the aluminum-clad cylinders in which tritium has been produced. Recovery of the gas must wait until early 1993, when heat and radiation have died down.</p> <p>But as might be predicted for an old machine that has been idle for years, preliminary testing found new squeaks and rattles. In a test, operators withdrew all 66 control rods, one at a time. When raised in unison, these rods allow the neutron flow that sustains the chain reaction; when lowered, they shut the reaction down. But one rod refused to fully lower, so the mechanics and engineers went back to work. Now they say startup will be soon.</p> <p>THE NATION</p>
670109>Quick Charge for Batteries Lifts Hope for Electric Cars Demonstrating the electric-car equivalent of a gas station, with a device that recharges batteries in minutes instead of hours, a small Georgia company has shattered the world record for miles traveled by an electric vehicle in 24 hours. At an average of 35 miles an hour at the Atlanta Motor Speedway last Friday, it was certainly not the fastest speed ever achieved there. But the feat, beginning a little after noon, was noteworthy all the same: an electric Chevy S-10 pickup truck, toting in its bed enough batteries to run a whole house for a day and traveling 44 to 45 laps of the 1.477-mile oval between charges, covered 831.8 miles. That beat by 200 miles the previous 24-hour record, set in Los Angeles on July 12, 1992, with a Geo Storm using the drivetrain and batteries of an Impact.  <p>The breakthrough by Electronic Power Technology Inc., a privately held start-up company based in Norcross, Ga., relied mostly on off-the-shelf electronic equipment. The difference lay in the company&#39;s technique of charging, which backers say is not only much faster than conventional recharging but also produces less wear and tear on the batteries. Proponents say that such techniques could lead to street-corner filling stations for electric vehicles, which would make the vehicles&#39; present limited range much less a problem.</p> <p>And maybe most significant, the technique works very well on &quot;basic, boring, lead-acid batteries,&quot; said to Karen A. Robinson, president and chief executive of Electronic Power Technology Inc., which calls itself E.P.T.I.</p> <p>That is important, because most electric-car research so far has tended to focus on developing better batteries that last longer between charges, which usually take at least several hours. By reducing the charging time to less than 20 minutes, engineers may be able to create viable electric vehicles powered by today&#39;s batteries, and they do not have the memory problems often associated with rechargable batteries.</p> <p>For last weekend&#39;s test, E.P.T.I. used a computer-controlled charger that crammed 16 kilowatt-hours of electricity into the pickup truck in just under 19 minutes. That energy powered the truck about 65 miles -- not nearly so far as a tank of gasoline but an acceptable range for many everyday driving needs, considering the relatively brief &quot;fill-up&quot; time and the fact that the electricity is cheaper for each mile than gasoline.</p> <p>The heart of the technique is sensing the voltage in the battery, the current flow and the temperature every few milliseconds, and varying the charging to suit the battery. In the first 30 seconds the charger assesses the battery, sending pulses of power and seeing how the battery responds. Different Approaches</p> <p>The charger is a little like a parent who wants to feed oatmeal to a baby as fast as possible, but watches the baby&#39;s behavior carefully, to minimize spillage, spit-up or having the bowl flung off the high chair. Just as different parents may have various feeding methods, E.P.T.I. is one of several companies developing recharging systems with feedback control, and each may watch for a different reaction. The factors can include the rate of current flow, the voltage and temperature of the battery and the rate of change of voltage or temperature.</p> <p>Depending on the point in the charge cycle and the type of battery, the feedback charger might send a jolt of 600 or 700 watts in about 800 milliseconds, or eight-tenths of a second. Then, for a much shorter period, perhaps 6 milliseconds (six-thousandths of a second), it does something a lay person would never expect: it discharges the battery, drawing off 2 or 3 watts. This tiny loss of electricity creates a chemical reaction that facilitates further recharging. The reason is that the reaction that creates the electricity also creates water, which allows a more thorough mixing of the chemicals at the battery plate, where the reaction is carried out, and the mixing allows the reaction to proceed faster.</p> <p>After the discharge, the system may briefly shut down the current and let the battery &quot;rest&quot; for 10 to 14 milliseconds, before sending another jolt, to allow mixing. The companies consider the precise times and quantities, and the criteria for deciding when to change current flow, proprietary. And in each case the times and quantities change as the battery&#39;s state of charge changes.</p> <p>Other companies working on such technology include Norvik Technologies, a company based in Mississauga, Ontario. Tinkering in the Basement</p> <p>Dr. Yury M. Podrazhansky, chief scientist for E.P.T.I., who used to work for Turner Broadcasting, said that he had developed the charging system in his basement at home, tinkering with a way to charge batteries faster for videocameras.</p> <p>E.P.T.I. said its technique lets the battery absorb more than 95 percent of the energy delivered to it, compared with only 65 percent or so in conventional charging. Energy that the batteries do not absorb turns into heat, which is one of the factors that gradually breaks down batteries, leaving them less and less able to hold a charge.</p> <p>Batteries charged E.P.T.I.&#39;s way, Dr. Podrazhansky said, &quot;will last forever.&quot; Of course, that assertion will take forever to prove, but early tests are promising. At the Advanced Research Projects Agency, a Federal organization that is helping finance the research, Maj. Richard C. Cope, a program manager, said that pulse charging clearly extended battery life; the only question, he said, is for how long.</p> <p>In the Atlanta demonstration, the truck pulled off the track when it was still about 25 percent charged, and was sent back out after being charged back to 80 percent or so. The reason is that recharging the last 20 percent of a battery&#39;s power is like climbing an ever-steeper mountain; it takes longer and can generate more heat.  Industry Competition</p> <p>E.P.T.I. has some competition, in a program financed by the International Lead Zinc Research Organization, an industry association in Research Triangle Park, N.C., comprising mining companies, battery manufacturers and related industries. That organization is helping pay for Norvik&#39;s work; it is also sponsoring development of battery-recharge systems for buses. The bus batteries are a different challenge because they are far larger and thus dissipate heat more slowly.</p> <p>Another potential competitor is the Beijing Founder Institute of Charge Technology. A New York company, Southfield Group Ltd., has recently begun selling the Chinese chargers in New York; according to Jay Doyle, a spokesman for Southfield, the technology was developed for the Chinese military.</p> <p>E.P.T.I. said it had received an invitation from the lead-zinc group to submit a proposal to receive funding for its development work.</p> <p>Besides its encouraging Atlanta speedway test, E.P.T.I. reports promising results from the lab. Another problem in battery recharging is that as the incoming electricity powers the chemical reaction that stores current, the chemicals build up in crystalline form. But the chemical reaction takes place on the crystals, and the larger the crystals, the lower their surface area, and the slower the reaction, so it is harder to reverse the process later and draw current out.  Ms. Robinson, E.P.T.I.&#39;s chief executive, said electron microscope photos showed that pulse charging resulted in small crystals.</p> <p>E.P.T.I.&#39;s chargers, which are to go into production later this year, could take the form of large, stationary quick-fill units -- electricity pumps might be a better term -- that might sell for $10,000 each, Ms. Robinson said. Smaller versions small enough to fit on the vehicle and drawing power from a standard 110-volt or 220-volt household circuit, would mean a charging time of several hours, but a longer lifetime for the battery, she said. These units would cost hundreds of dollars. Or owners of electric cars could use conventional chargers at home for overnight use, and electricity pumps on the road in a pinch.</p> <p>The electricity pump would not be good news for everyone. It could create big problems for electric utilities, for example. Until now, the utilities have been eager for electric cars because they have expected that people would recharge their vehicles overnight, when demand for power is low, and utility generating plants are often idle.</p> <p>But the electricity pump would be used in the daytime, when demand is already high. And each pump would draw about 200 kilowatts when in use, a level typical of a small factory or middle-sized office building. Ms. Robinson said her company, which has had assistance from Georgia Power, Florida Power and Light, and Hawaiian Electric, was looking into ways to draw power at night for the pump and store it for daytime delivery to cars.</p> <p>The new charger is also significant as yet another symbol of the end of the cold war. Dr. Podrazhansky immigrated to this country in 1978, after a career managing electronics factories in the Soviet Union. His staff includes Dr. Tamara Gendlina, who holds a Ph.D. in electrochemistry from the University of Leningrad and formerly did battery work for the Russian space program, and Dr. Yefim Kusharskiy, a former physics professor at the Kharkov Polytechnical Institute, who, according to the company, designed batteries for torpedoes and other military devices.</p> <p>Completing the circle, the Advanced Research Projects Agency that is subsidizing E.P.T.I.&#39;s work is part of the Pentagon, and, until the cold war thawed, was called the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency.</p> <p>BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
541262>E.P.A. Told to Publish New Air Pollution Rules Before Compliance Deadline The Environmental Protection Agency cannot wait until next January to publish new air pollution rules that the states are supposed to put into effect this November, a Federal District Court judge has ruled. The E.P.A. had planned to wait until Jan. 28, 1993, to publish its regulations for a car-inspection program that the Clean Air Act says must be in place by Nov. 15, 1992.  <p>The agency&#39;s acting general counsel, Raymond B. Ludwiszewski, acknowledged that expecting the states to comply with rules before they are written &quot;might appear to be an anomaly.&quot;</p> <p>Late Wednesday, Judge Denis R. Hurley ruled that it was also illegal.</p> <p>Judge Hurley gave the E.P.A. until Nov. 6, leaving the states nine days to comply with the regulations, which are expected to run several hundred pages. Tests Are Inadequate</p> <p>At issue are automobile inspections in 75 metropolitan areas that fail to meet Federal smog standards in 22 states. By some estimates, 5 percent of cars emit 50 percent of smog-forming ozone. Many states already conduct annual inspections, but experts say they miss dirty cars, in part because nearly all states test emissions while cars are idling. Newer cars with computer-controlled fuel injection behave differently at different speeds, so idling tests are ineffective.</p> <p>When Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990, it required &quot;enhanced inspection and maintenance&quot; procedures, to be put in effect by Nov. 15, 1992, and gave the E.P.A. until Nov. 15, 1991 to issue the regulations.</p> <p>That is what the E.P.A. has yet to do.</p> <p>&quot;If you look at the Clean Air Act, there are literally hundreds of deadlines in the first year and a half,&quot; said Mr. Ludwiszewski. &quot;You try as hard as you can to make as much progress as you can. You try to push the most important regulations up, but sometimes you have slippage.&quot;</p> <p>Not everyone was understanding.</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s almost like they&#39;re saying, &#39;The dog ate my homework&#39;,&quot; said S. William Becker, the executive director of the Association of State and Local Air Pollution Control Officials, which is based in Washington. States Risk Lawsuits</p> <p>The E.P.A. cannot be lenient, even if it wants to, because the Clean Air Act gives citizens the right to sue states that are not in compliance. A judge who found a state to be in violation could hold up Federal highway funds or ban new construction, public and private, on the grounds that it would add to pollution.</p> <p>The suit was originally brought against the E.P.A. by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based environmental group. A lawyer there, James F. Simon, said that while implementing the law would cost the states money, violating it would cost more. He said that the rule was opposed by some service stations that now do inspections and would be forced out of the business if more elaborate equipment is needed.</p> <p>&quot;One hundred million people live in areas with unhealthy air,&quot; he said. &quot;For the E.P.A. to hold up this rule because of the economic interests of some small gas station owners seems unjustifiable to me.&quot;</p> <p>In many cases, car owners will probably have to take their vehicles to central points, to be tested on treadmills. The regulations that the states are waiting for include questions like whether the repair work can be done at the same site or must be performed elsewhere, and how often cars will have to be tested. Deadline&#39;s Meaning Debated</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the E.P.A., Martha Casey, said that her agency had finished writing the rule in February, only three months past deadline, but that the Office of Management and Budget had been very slow in its review, and is only now returning it for further work.</p> <p>The E.P.A. and the states disagree on precisely what must be done by Nov. 15. The E.P.A. believes that the law requires the states to present detailed plans for implementing an enhanced inspection and maintenance program. Given its own tardiness, the E.P.A. had said that, in lieu of detailed plans to comply with nonexistent regulations, it would accept a promise by states to comply when the regulations were issued.</p> <p>But Mr. Becker, of the association of states, said that the states were supposed to have actual inspection programs in place by the deadline, which is now clearly impossible.</p> <p>The states do have some clues, Mr. Ludwiszewski said, because his agency has met with them and circulated draft regulations. If they are really concerned about huge penalties, he said, &quot;then you take your best guess and go with it,&quot; instituting a program before the Federal requirements are spelled out. But, Mr. Becker said, that could mean state air pollution commissioners asking their legislatures to enact new, unpopular rules that might never be required by the E.P.A. If, for example, the state officials ask legislatures to require that repair shops be separate from inspection stations, and the E.P.A. regulations do not include that requirement, the officials will be accused of &quot;crying wolf once too often.&quot;</p>
591256>Try Gas. (Keep Oil.) It&#39;s Better. (It&#39;s Not.) Last fall, Mary Ann and Anthony Pasquale replaced the oil burner in their house, in Whitestone, Queens, with one that uses natural gas. &quot;I think it&#39;s warmer,&quot; Mrs. Pasquale said. &quot;We keep the thermostat around 69, and it&#39;s so hot in here sometimes. Before, we kept it at 72 and it wasn&#39;t as warm.&quot; But, she added after a moment, maybe that was just her imagination. Heating experts would agree with that theory; fuel choice should not make any difference, they say. No matter, the Pasquales are happy. Major Marketing War Rose Randolph is not. After the 35-year-old oil burner in her house in Flushing broke down last October, Mrs. Randolph called Consolidated Edison. The utility arranged for a contractor to install a new natural gas furnace that now keeps her house warm. But her last two monthly bills were $143 and $165, she said, compared to the $100 or less that she used to spend for oil every month.  <p>Experts would have trouble with that one, too; they say that fuel costs are about equal lately.</p> <p>The Pasquales and Mrs. Randolph, along with about 7 million other homeowners in the Northeast and 11.2 million nationwide, are the targets of a major marketing war between the natural gas utilities, now flush with fresh supplies from new pipelines and deregulated wells, and the oil dealers, who are fighting fiercely to hold on to their share. Though oil dealers claim to have competitive prices and superior technology, almost no one with a gas system goes to the trouble of installing a tank so a house can switch to oil.</p> <p>For consumers, it means an ordeal of claims and counterclaims every time they turn on the radio.</p> <p>Most of the ads touting oil heat carry the innuendo that natural gas is unsafe, without ever quite saying why. &quot;Take a chance?&quot; says a male voice in the oil ads. &quot;Yeah, maybe on a lottery ticket. But gas in my house? O.K., so odds are nothing would go wrong -- but I&#39;d rather not bet on it.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Our ads always have a subliminal line in them,&quot; said Robert Greenes of the Metropolitan Energy Council, which represents fuel oil dealers. But he contended that gas</p> <p>less safe, mostly because it is more prone to produce carbon monoxide.</p> <p>The gas companies, on the other hand, often claim that their burners are more efficient than oil burners, which Government engineers say is not usually the case.</p> <p>The dueling ad campaigns have the two sides at each other&#39;s throat. &quot;They&#39;re lying,&quot; said Mr. Greenes, the oil promoter.</p> <p>&quot;We&#39;re dealing with a wily competitor,&quot; said Paul K. Morris, the director of gas sales and marketing at the Long Island Lighting Company. Stretching the Facts</p> <p>The fact is, said one Government engineer who has spent the last 15 years studying home heating system technology, &quot;both of them are taking the facts and stretching them, and distorting them.&quot; The engineer, Roger J. McDonald of the Department of Energy&#39;s Brookhaven National Laboratory, said that for many homeowners the choice between fuels is &quot;a tossup,&quot; and that more important decisions, like how efficient a furnace or a boiler a homeowner should buy, get hardly any attention.</p> <p>This is a strange war. On one side, the oil industry bolsters its case with studies from Greenpeace, hardly a traditional ally. (A Greenpeace study argues that unburned natural gas that escapes into the atmosphere contributes to the greenhouse effect, even though substituting natural gas for oil reduces production of carbon dioxide, another greenhouse gas.)</p> <p>On the other side, the gas industry hardly uses the word oil without attaching the pejorative &quot;imported.&quot; But in the New York area, utilities are now able to sell more natural gas mostly because of the completion of the Iroquois pipeline, which brings gas here from Canada. &#39;Eliminates the Agita&#39;</p> <p>The two sides can disagree about almost anything. At Con Edison, for example, Robert F. Crane, the vice president for gas business development, said in an interview that a major selling point is &quot;you don&#39;t have to wait for a delivery. It eliminates the agita.&quot;</p> <p>But John D. Maniscalco, executive vice president of the New York Oil Heating Association Inc., made a circle with his thumb and forefinger, approximating the 2-inch diameter of the gas pipes that run from mains under the streets to meters in basements. &quot;That delivery truck works a lot better than a little pipe,&quot; he said. &quot;There are a lot of leaks in that pipeline.&quot;</p> <p>In fact, the only time in the recent past when there was a threat of a delivery problem, both fuels were affected. That was in December 1989, when extreme winter weather left fuel oil barges blocked by ice, interrupted some production of natural gas and strained gas transmission systems. Few &#39;Horror Stories&#39;</p> <p>Another point of dispute is safety, but Mr. McDonald, of Brookhaven, pointed out that there are 92 million occupied housing units in this country, yet only occasional &quot;horror stories&quot; from any kind of heating system problem. &quot;Basically, both of these are safe systems, statistically,&quot; he said. There is a risk to using either fuel to heat a house, he said, but &quot;it&#39;s a lot safer than driving on the expressway every day.&quot;</p> <p>Even the oil dealers acknowledge that the explosion risk from natural gas is very small. They say a bigger risk is carbon monoxide poisoning, which can result from incomplete burning of fuel in an out-of-tune burner. Carbon monoxide can come from oil or gas, but if the oil burner goes out of whack it will produce smoke, a warning to the occupants, while the gas burner will produce only the colorless, odorless carbon monoxide.</p> <p>But others praise natural gas burners as being simple and less likely to have problems.</p> <p>The biggest clash is over the cost of fuel and the efficiency of the furnace or boiler, and both are the subject of confusion.</p> <p>Even the gas suppliers don&#39;t agree on the cost differences between the two fuels. Con Edison maintains that over the last 10 winters, the cost of No. 2 oil, the kind used in houses, has been equal to the cost of gas, per unit of heat content. &quot;We don&#39;t claim the price of gas is going to be lower than the price of oil for a long time,&quot; said Mary Jane McCartney, vice president of gas supply.</p> <p>But Lilco says that gas has been nearly 20 percent cheaper than oil in its service territory in the last eight years.</p> <p>Oil dealers say that prices are now at parity and will stay that way over the long run. They point out that many dealers now offer their customers a contract with a guaranteed per-gallon price for the season.</p> <p>If prices are nearly equal, the key difference is efficiency, or how much of the fuel&#39;s heat is delivered to the house, versus how much goes up the chimney. Gas companies try to persuade homeowners that a new gas system would be substantially more efficient than their old oil systems, cutting fuel requirements by 10 or 15 percent. But if a furnace or boiler is on its last legs, experts say, a better question is how a new gas burner compares to a new oil burner.</p> <p>Here it appears, at least on the average, that oil has the upper hand. According to researchers at Brookhaven, the efficiency of gas equipment now being manufactured averages 78 percent, while oil equipment averages 86 percent. But at the American Gas Association, Mark E. Stultz, a spokesman, said that the efficiency of the best gas unit is higher than the efficiency of the best oil unit, and that in cold climates like New York&#39;s, homeowners tend to install very high-efficiency units.</p> <p>In either case, what the homeowner should consider is not the average efficiency, but the efficiency of the particular unit that the oil dealer or gas utility is trying to sell. This is measured by a federally mandated yardstick called the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency, known in the industry as Afue (pronounced A-few).</p> <p>Experts say that the houses where conversion is easiest are those that already have gas service, usually for cooking.</p> <p>At Brookhaven, Mr. McDonald suggests that consumers think about the choice without any of the near-Messianic overlay of the gas utilities&#39; pitch. &quot;They&#39;re not doing it to clean up the environment or save people money; they want to make money for their shareholders,&quot; he said. It may make more sense, he said, to add insulation in the attic or install a storm door, &quot;something that will lower the heating load forever.&quot; And in dealing with oil dealers, he said, do not assume anything about the price of upgrades that would improve the efficiency of an old oil burner.</p> <p>&quot;You can wheel and deal a lot,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s like buying a car.&quot;</p>
766137>Electric Car Sets a Record: 238 Miles Without a Charge A four-passenger electric car with the interior space of a Ford Taurus and a lightweight all-composite body has set a record for the distance traveled by a battery-powered vehicle without recharging: 238 miles in mixed city-highway driving. The car, the Sunrise, built by the Solectria Corporation of Wilmington, Mass., set the record on Thursday in the course of the American Tour de Sol, an annual five-day road rally for electric vehicles.  <p>Electric car advocates hailed the achievement. &quot;The enormous campaign by the oil companies and big auto companies to say that electric vehicle technology is not here, is false,&quot; said Sheila Lynch, the executive director of the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium, a Government-financed organization that oversees research grants in electric and natural gas vehicles.</p> <p>The old distance record, also set by Solectria in last year&#39;s Tour de Sol, was 214 miles. That car, which had the body of a Geo Metro subcompact, used the same type of nickel metal-hydride batteries.</p> <p>Those batteries are in common use in laptop computers, but are not commercially available in automotive sizes. A joint partnership of the developer, the Ovonic Battery Corporation of Troy, Mich., and General Motors, plans to produce them soon for automotive use.</p> <p>Composites, relatively expensive compared with steel, are used on some aircraft parts and to make tennis racquets, golf-club shafts and the like. Their use in cars, though rare, is increasing. &quot;The Saturn has a composite door,&quot; Ms. Lynch said, &quot;and the Viper is an all-composite car, although it is low volume.&quot;  If it had 20,000 orders a year, Solectria says, it could sell the Sunrise for $20,000. The car could carry nickel metal-hydride batteries at that price, the company says, if the batteries&#39; cost falls as projected.</p> <p>The race, in its seventh year, is run by the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association of Greenfield, Mass. This year it ran from Waterbury, Conn., to Portland, Me. Thursday&#39;s leg was on city streets and country roads from Lexington, Mass., to Dover, N.H.</p> <p>Five other cars in the race also traveled more than 100 miles in a day. Nancy Hazard, the race organizer, said that consumers were hesitant to buy the electric cars now offered for sale, with ranges of 50 to 75 miles, but that cars capable of going 100 to 125 miles would be more practical. &quot;The 238 miles is almost double that number, and it makes me feel very confident people would buy this kind of vehicle,&quot; she said.</p>
511532>Reformulated Gas: Cleaner and Greener The tiger in your tank is about to be reformulated. Federal and state air-pollution regulations have already required some changes in gasoline around the nation, and many more are coming by 1995. The object is to clean up what comes out of the tailpipe. The question is: How will the engine like it?  <p>Maybe better, maybe worse than with the fuel sold now, depending on the age of the car and the estimate of the engineer. Pessimists say that some older cars, with carburetors, may tend to stall on reformulated fuel. Some may be harder to start on cold mornings. But newer cars, with fuel injection, may perform better. And car exhaust will not smell as bad. A Change in Priorities</p> <p>There will also be less hype in the marketplace, said William R. Berman, the chief environmental affairs lobbyist of the American Automobile Association. Oil companies now push hard to sell high-octane gasoline, Mr. Berman said, because the companies make a bigger profit margin on that grade, but it does most cars no good. But when the new fuel regulations take effect, refineries will be so strained meeting the standards that they will not have the equipment to produce as much high-octane fuel, he said, and &quot;instead of high-octane gas you&#39;ll have &#39;green&#39; gas, which is better for all of us.&quot;</p> <p>The price will not be better, though. Estimates vary on how much more the new gas will cost to produce. The price at the pump, as always, will be determined by what the market will bear. But an additional 25 cents a gallon or so would not surprise many refiners and regulators.</p> <p>Widespread changes in gasoline began in the late 1980&#39;s, when regulators in New York, New Jersey and the six New England states required the reduction of gasoline &quot;volatility,&quot; or the tendency of the liquid to evaporate. The goal was to reduce the volume of hydrocarbon fumes that rise into the atmosphere and, after cooking in the summer sun with nitrogen oxides, turn into smog.</p> <p>But from the engine&#39;s point of view, volatility is desirable. While gasoline may be sold as a liquid, in the cylinders it is burned as a gas, and fuel that will not turn to a gas will not burn thoroughly.</p> <p>When the eight Northeastern states first debated requiring lower volatility in fuel sold in summer, some oil companies and even the A.A.A. warned that on cold mornings in the late spring or early fall, cars might not start. That complication never developed, most people now agree, and new Environmental Protection Agency rules require that south of Washington, fuel volatility be cut further this summer.</p> <p>When that rule takes effect, said Allen A. Kozinski, the vice president of research and development at the Amoco Oil Company in Chicago, maintaining &quot;driveability&quot; will require careful mixing of the various chemical components of gasoline. Volatility will be cut by reducing the content of two chemicals that tend to boil away first, butane and isopentane, and some other chemicals that are slow to vaporize will have to be removed from fuel, he said, and slightly lighter ones substituted.</p> <p>Carbureted cars are the most sensitive to fuel volatility reductions, he said, and may tend to hesitate or stall. &quot;On the other hand, those drivers are used to that,&quot; he said, adding that cars with fuel injection will be affected less.</p> <p>Mr. Berman, of the A.A.A., said he favored studies by the E.P.A. to measure the effects of reformulated gas on cars. &quot;Why should the motorist become a guinea pig for the evolution in gasoline chemistry?&quot; he said.</p> <p>But some oil companies have made changes voluntarily and are advertising that their gasoline helps clean the air. And Mr. Kozinski said that Amoco had tested its gasoline on 60 cars of various vintages and brands and had found no difficulties.</p> <p>People who own newer cars will benefit from the new gasolines, said Walter M. Kreucher, the manager for advanced environmental and fuels engineering at the Ford Motor Company. They must have detergents to clean fuel injectors, he said, while today only about three-quarters of gas has the optimum amount of detergents.</p> <p>The reason for the requirement is that if the fuel has no detergents, impurities can plug a fuel port, throwing off the air-fuel ratio. Late-model cars have exhaust sensors connected to a computer processor that will try to correct the problem by injecting more fuel into all the cylinders, but this will throw off the balance in all the other cylinders, defeating the car&#39;s antipollution system.</p> <p>Another advantage of the reformulated fuel, Mr. Kreucher and others say, is a lower level of sulfur, which gives car exhaust a rotten-egg smell.</p> <p>In many cities, including Denver and Phoenix, gasoline with oxygen is already required in winter. The idea of oxygenated gasoline is to promote fuller combustion, with more production of carbon dioxide and less production of carbon monoxide. This will not make much difference in the emissions from newer cars, whose tailpipe sensors will measure the fuel-air ratio and adjust accordingly. But it will cut emissions from older cars.</p> <p>Under Federal law, nine cities with the worst summer air pollution will soon get fuel with oxygen, as well as other changes. They are Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Houston, Chicago, Milwaukee, San Diego and Los Angeles. State officials in other areas are expected to adopt the reformulated gas, too.</p> <p>Oxygenated gas may cut mileage slightly, because molecules bearing an oxygen atom are already partly burned and thus have less energy in them. Will motorists notice this loss, which will probably come to 1.5 to 2 percent? &quot;It depends on how well they track it,&quot; Mr. Kozinski said.</p>
1503128>Arms Official Brushes Off A Complaint About Audit The top nuclear weapons official at the Energy Department has brushed aside a complaint by the department&#39;s inspector general that some employees were instructed not to &#39;&#39;spill your guts&#39;&#39; when questioned in a security investigation. The official, Linton F. Brooks, head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, a semiautonomous agency within the department, said in an internal memorandum to officials at nine Energy Department sites that the inspector general&#39;s office had taken an &#39;&#39;erroneous message&#39;&#39; from the training documents given to employees.  <p>&#39;&#39;The inspector general interpreted these comments as discouraging full cooperation with the inspection team,&#39;&#39; Mr. Brooks said in the June 19 memorandum. &#39;&#39;Upon review, this perception turns out to be incorrect.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The inspector general, Gregory H. Friedman, reported in January that employees at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico had been told in a training course to be careful what they said to security inspectors or what they wrote down.</p> <p>The training materials for employees facing an audit on computer security said: &#39;&#39;Handwritten notes can be especially damaging. They are not easily disavowed.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Brooks&#39;s memorandum said that those instructions were &#39;&#39;appropriate cautions&#39;&#39; and had been misinterpreted by the inspector general.</p> <p>His memorandum was provided to The New York Times by the Project on Government Oversight, a group that has often publicized Energy Department employees&#39; security complaints. Peter Stockton, a senior investigator with the group and a former security adviser to the energy secretary, said in an interview that the memorandum was outrageous.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;When you&#39;re doing an investigation,&#39;&#39; Mr. Stockton said, &#39;&#39;you do indeed want people to spill their guts and to suggest to you who is responsible for things.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>He added that the memorandum sounded like something a defense lawyer would tell a client and not something from an official who wanted a successful inquiry.</p> <p>A spokesman for Mr. Brooks, Bryan Wilkes of the National Nuclear Security Administration, said the memorandum &#39;&#39;was written to make it absolutely clear that there should be no doubts&#39;&#39; that all Energy Department and contractor employees should cooperate with investigations.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;What he was trying to say,&#39;&#39; Mr. Wilkes said, &#39;&#39;is that even the perception of lack of cooperation is unacceptable. Far from undercutting the inspector general, this letter is meant to support the inspector general. Parts can be open for misunderstanding, I guess.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In a footnote, the memorandum said the warning not to &#39;&#39;spill your guts&#39;&#39; was a caution &#39;&#39;against providing information in areas beyond an individual&#39;s responsibility,&#39;&#39; that the warning about writing was meant to emphasize &#39;&#39;the importance of proper classification&#39;&#39; and that the warning against finger pointing was to discourage &#39;&#39;blaming others for shortcomings uncovered in an audit.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Brooks said in the memorandum that the inspector general had taken the cautions out of context. But he added that &#39;&#39;there is an affirmative obligation to help the auditors discover the facts&#39;&#39; and that the training material should have said so.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the inspector general, Wilma Slaughter, said after a copy of the memorandum was faxed to her on Thursday, &#39;&#39;We stand by reports as written, and the findings are accurate.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Ms. Slaughter said Mr. Friedman had not seen Mr. Brooks&#39;s memorandum and was not available to comment.</p> <p>On Capitol Hill, Lawrence Halloran, a spokesman for Representative Christopher Shays, the Connecticut Republican who is chairman of the National Security Subcommittee of the Government Reform Committee, said Energy Department employees had been undergoing audits for years and &#39;&#39;shouldn&#39;t require spoon feeding on how to handle this.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It speaks of a somewhat paranoid and closed culture over there,&#39;&#39; Mr. Halloran said.</p> <p>He added that audits by inspectors general, who are watchdogs in the departments they survey and generally report directly to the department secretary and relevant officials in Congress, usually end with conferences where auditors sit down with officials of the office they are studying and review preliminary findings, giving the latter a chance to point out misunderstandings.</p> <p>Mr. Halloran said it was troubling that an Energy Department official would say a finding was out of context after the report had been issued.</p> <p>THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR SAFETY</p>
453412>G.E. Boycott Is Working, Group Says A group that has been pressing a boycott against the General Electric Company for five years to try to force the company&#39;s withdrawal from nuclear weapons work said yesterday that it had made a significant dent in the company&#39;s sales of medical diagnostic equipment. But the company said that its share of that market was growing, along with its sales of consumer goods, and that the boycott did not appear to be having any effect.  <p>Although used in other issues, the boycott of consumer goods is an unusual tactic in the long-simmering national debate over the threat of nuclear war, as well as the environmental and health impact of nuclear weapons production. The boycott also raises the largely unexplored question of how much blame corporations should bear for work they perform under Government supervision at Government-owned plants, even if that work results in health problems for employees and local residents, and causes widespread environmental damage. Aiming at G.E.&#39;s Image</p> <p>Although General Electric was an early leader in the nuclear weapons production field, the company has all but withdrawn from the weapons-making business. It remains, however, one of the nation&#39;s largest military contractors, building components for planes, missiles and submarines that might be used to fight a nuclear war.</p> <p>The Infact group has been trying for five years to cut sales of everything from G.E.&#39;s light bulbs to refrigerators. The organization, based in Boston, led the boycott of Nestle to put pressure on that company to curb its marketing of infant formula in developing countries.</p> <p>The current Infact campaign is aimed at &quot;decreasing the value of G.E.&#39;s image,&quot; said Nancy Cole, the group&#39;s executive director. The company &quot;is responsible for an enormous amount of human misery.&quot; A New Tool: Videotape</p> <p>Infact said that four million people and 450 organizations had signed petitions endorsing the boycott. And the group displayed a new tool yesterday, a 29-minute videotape featuring former G.E. employees or neighbors of a nuclear bomb plant that the company once operated for the Government. The people say they were hurt by unsafe practices at the plant.</p> <p>From 1946 until the mid-1960&#39;s, General Electric operated the Hanford nuclear reservation in south-central Washington state, a site now estimated by the Federal Government to represent an environmental liability of tens of billions of dollars. During the late 1940&#39;s, the Government has said, huge amounts of radiation were release from the plant, sometimes intentionally, and Government experts now say enough was released to damage the health of people in the region, especially children.</p> <p>The videotape also focuses on worker safety at the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, near Schenectady, N.Y., where General Electric currently performs research on submarine reactors and helps train operators.</p> <p>Infact said that some hospitals around the country, most of them operated by religious orders, had turned away from G.E. for their purchase of big-ticket diagnosis and treatment tools like linear accelerators, magnetic resonance imaging units and computerized tomography scanners. These hospitals, Infact said, have purchased a combined total of more than $30 million worth of such equipment from G.E.&#39;s competitors.  G.E.&#39;s Rebuttal</p> <p>But a spokesman for G.E., Ford C. Slater, said in an interview that G.E.&#39;s share of the market for medical diagnostic imaging equipment had grown, along with the company&#39;s revenues and profits. Since 1985, when the boycott began, revenue has increased from $32 billion, to $58 billion, he said.</p> <p>A specialist in business ethics, James W. Kuhn, a business professor at Columbia University, said that the boycott raised a question of what the activists&#39; target should be.</p> <p>&quot;This is a Government policy, approved by Congress, and a weapon used for supposedly patriotic reasons,&quot; he said. But, he added, the boycott could take on momentum if a national consensus emerged that too much was being spent on nuclear weapons.</p> <p>COMPANY NEWS</p>
753882>Con Edison Penalized $217,800 for Violating Work Safety Rules in &#39;92 Blast Consolidated Edison has agreed to pay a $217,800 penalty for violating worker safety rules in connection with a steam explosion that killed a mechanic and badly burned several firefighters in November 1992 at a generating station in Manhattan, the company said yesterday. It will also institute new safety precautions at all its plants that burn oil and natural gas, and open them to broader inspections by Federal safety experts, officials said.  <p>By accepting the agreement with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the company essentially agreed to the bulk of the charges against it, said a spokesman for the company, Bruce H. Wittmer.</p> <p>The safety agency had charged that the accident occurred because Con Ed had failed to drain out all the water that had collected in idle steam pipes before introducing new steam. When new steam was added, the water created a &quot;water hammer,&quot; a heavy slug of water moving at high speed, which broke through the steel pipe.</p> <p>The accident, on the evening of Nov. 10, 1992, occurred at the Waterside plant at First Avenue and 39th Street, which makes electricity and steam for Con Ed&#39;s system. It roared and rattled windows in the neighborhood for hours. Two firefighters were severely burned while searching for trapped workers; it later turned out that except for the mechanic who was killed, no one was left in the area.</p> <p>OSHA said a &quot;water hammer&quot; problem had also caused two earlier explosions, on Aug. 19, 1989, on East 20th Street, near Gramercy Park, in which three people died and asbestos was sprayed over a wide area, and another at 40th Street and Madison Avenue on Sept. 25, 1989. It had originally proposed fining Con Ed $247,000 for the Waterside explosion.</p> <p>At Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America, which was a party to the proceeding before an administrative law judge at the Department of Labor, Michael D. Ivancich, the director of safety and health, said, &quot;This is the biggest worker safety problem they&#39;ve ever owned up to.&quot;</p> <p>The Gramercy Park blast, although it killed 3, injured 24 and forced the evacuation of hundreds from their homes, resulted in only $7,000 in fines by OSHA. Con Ed did, however, eventually admit that it had failed for days to tell Federal authorities that asbestos had been released into the air, and a company lawyer said that the utility had paid $90 million to settle civil lawsuits arising from the blast.</p> <p>Mr. Ivancich said that the company had agreed to keep better maintenance records and train workers better in reducing the occurrence of water hammer. &quot;They&#39;ve taken care of everything we&#39;ve asked and OSHA has asked,&quot; he said.</p>
832199>Investigators Citing Design Flaw And Engineer Error in Accident Investigators suggested today that some of the 11 people killed in a head-on  train collision on Friday might have lived if emergency exits had operated properly. The investigators also suggested that the accident was the result of operator error and design flaw. Passengers were unable to open some of the windows and doors on one of the trains, a Maryland Rail Commuter train, said John J. Goglia, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board. All of the deaths occurred in the front car of that train, which caught fire after it was drenched with diesel fuel from the Amtrak train it had hit. The board may issue emergency recommendations on such exits soon, Mr. Goglia said.  <p>Speaking at a news conference in this Washington suburb where the accident occurred on Friday afternoon, Mr. Goglia said that a crucial track signal was located before a station stop, rather than after. He said the signal should have been yellow, and that the engineer of the commuter train could have forgotten the color after he stopped at the station, in Kensington, Md., less than three miles from the crash site.</p> <p>Mr. Goglia said that investigators had yet to determine whether the signal was yellow, indicating a speed limit of 30 miles per hour, or green, with a limit of 70 m.p.h. The signal also could have changed color while the commuter train was in the station, he said.</p> <p>The commuter train accelerated to 63 m.p.h. after leaving the station, investigators said. The engineer began braking about 1,100 feet before the collision, and had slowed to about 40 m.p.h. at impact. The Amtrak train was traveling about 30 m.p.h.</p> <p>Asked this evening if the accident could have resulted from an error by the engineer of the commuter train, Mr. Goglia said, &quot;based on the facts, it&#39;s moving us in that direction.&quot; He was also asked if the placement of the signal constituted an accident waiting to happen.</p> <p>&quot;That would suggest that,&quot; Mr. Goglia said.</p> <p>The Kensington signal had previously been located after the station, but was  moved as part of a project to upgrade the signal system that was completed in 1993, said Gary Sease, a spokesman for the CSX Corporation, the operator of the  commuter train and owner of the tracks. The $12 million project was undertaken to increase the number of passenger trains the tracks could handle.</p> <p>Maryland, which owns the commuter line cars, paid $9 million to improve the CSX system because getting more passenger trains on the tracks was the state&#39;s goal, not CSX&#39;s. Conflicts between freight and passenger operations are common on railroads, especially where the system is primarily a freight operation, as the one here is.</p> <p>In systems meant for passenger trains, the signals are usually put where the  engineer can see them on leaving a station.</p> <p>Investigators said that both trains and the rails were mechanically sound, and the part of the signal system they have tested so far, about half, is also in good condition.</p> <p>But they have not completely analyzed computerized data recorders that will tell them the signal&#39;s color when the commuter train passed through. The signal  is supposed to turn yellow when the crossover that the Amtrak train was using is in operation, and the circuitry is still good, Mr. Goglia said. But the crossover switch was destroyed in the crash. He said that investigators do not expect to learn the signal&#39;s color until late this week.</p> <p>The engineer and assistant engineer of the Amtrak train were among the 25 people injured in the accident, and are still hospitalized. But other railroad personnel interviewed by investigators say they recall the commuter train&#39;s engineer did acknowledge the signal by radio, as required by company policy; they do not recall what color he acknowledged, the witnesses said. The engineer  died in the crash.</p> <p>Railroad personnel cleared the last of the rail cars off the tracks today. Investigators said the tracks had to be cleared so they could test the signal system. The system registers the presence of trains on the tracks by running electric currents down the rails, with the trains completing the circuit.</p> <p>The crash, which occurred at 5:38 P.M. at the tail end of a snowstorm, ruptured the diesel fuel tanks on Amtrak&#39;s Capitol Limited, which had left Washington&#39;s Union Station about 20 minutes earlier and was bound for Chicago, and sent a ball of flame several stories high.</p> <p>The commuter train, headed for Union Station, was particularly vulnerable because it was operating with the locomotive in the back pushing three passenger cars, what is called &quot;push mode.&quot; The engineer was in a small cab in the front passenger car. With him were the conductor, assistant conductor and 15 of the 17 passengers.</p> <p>In addition to the engineer, the other two crew members and eight of the passengers, all trainees from a Job Corps program in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., died. The destruction was so thorough that firefighters initially believed that they had the remains of 12 people, not 11.</p> <p>Some of the victims were only identifiable through dental records. Among the  long-term issues that the safety board said it is considering is the &quot;survivability&quot; of passenger coaches used in push mode, and the integrity of diesel fuel tanks.</p> <p>The Amtrak train was carrying 164 passengers and a crew of 18, with 2 locomotives, 7 passenger-carrying cars and 8 freight and baggage cars.</p> <p>The crash was in an urban neighborhood of this suburb just north of Washington, and people rushed out of neighboring apartment buildings to help the survivors.</p> <p>There are two main tracks in the area, and they are set up so each can handle trains in either direction.</p> <p>Just before the crash, a dispatcher at a CSX control center in Jacksonville,  Fla., ordered a slow-moving westbound freight train to stop so the Amtrak train  could pass. For the Amtrak engineers, with Union Station behind them, the freight train would have been directly ahead, and they were switched to the left-hand track to pass. At the point where they were to switch back to the right-hand track, ahead of the freight, they were struck by the on-coming commuter train.</p>
1509901>Mrs. Clinton Asks FEMA For New Test At Indian Pt. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to hold another test of the emergency plan at the Indian Point nuclear power plant within six months, monitored by &#39;&#39;an independent panel of experts.&#39;&#39; But an agency spokesman said that would be difficult to do. Senator Clinton met on Thursday with Michael D. Brown, the director of the agency, and gave him a letter stating that she was &#39;&#39;deeply disturbed&#39;&#39; by the agency&#39;s ruling last week that the emergency plans for Indian Point were adequate to protect the public.  <p>In a statement on Thursday, she said: &#39;&#39;I feel strongly that this decision process has been flawed. A plant like Indian Point must be held to the highest standards for safety and security. It is long past time for us to see some concrete action to improve emergency preparedness around Indian Point.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In her letter, Senator Clinton asked for a list of the documents FEMA used in making its determination. She also requested a list of improvements made since the most recent test of the emergency plan in September 2002 and since a state-commissioned report issued last January by James Lee Witt, a former emergency management agency director who is now a private consultant, which said the plans were not adequate.</p> <p>A spokesman for the emergency management agency, Chad Kolton, said it had begun complying with some of Mrs. Clinton&#39;s requests. &#39;&#39;We want to be as attentive as possible to what her concerns are,&#39;&#39; he said. But he added: &#39;&#39;There is a question as to whether having an exercise in six months&#39; time is possible. There are a number of other parties involved.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>They include state and local governments and the Entergy Corporation, which owns the two Indian Point reactors, he said.</p> <p>He said he did not know where the agency would find the independent observers Mrs. Clinton was seeking, but it would look into that, too.</p> <p>The next test of the emergency plan is scheduled for June 2004.</p> <p>Senator Clinton has frequently called for improvements in the emergency plans and the plant&#39;s security-guard force.</p> <p>Mrs. Clinton, in a telephone interview on Thursday, said the agency&#39;s position that it could not hold a test in six months was &#39;&#39;not acceptable as an answer, because FEMA has gone ahead and approved off-site emergency plans over the objections of local governments and first responders who are actually responsible for carrying it out.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If there is no truly unbiased, independent review,&#39;&#39; she added, &#39;&#39;how can people be certain of the soundness of the plan?&#39;&#39;</p>
1298219>G.M. Displays More Efficient Large Engine With gasoline prices near their highest levels of the last 20 years, General Motors is bringing back an idea it last tried in 1981: an engine that shuts down some of its cylinders when they are not needed, to save fuel. The 8-cylinder engine, which powered a Sierra pickup truck smoothly over the hilly country roads here, 70 miles from Washington, is one of two innovations that G.M. plans to introduce soon, and one of a larger number of ideas that are drawing new interest as the fuel they save becomes more valuable. The engine, which has what G.M. calls &#39;&#39;displacement on demand,&#39;&#39; was on display this week for reporters at the Summit Point Raceway here, along with a hybrid that is completely different from those already on the road, and several &#39;&#39;concept cars.&#39;&#39; G.M. says the pickup engine increases fuel efficiency 8 to 10 percent.  <p>The pickup gave just two clues to its unusual nature: a little light on the dashboard, which will not be present in production models, that indicated when it was running on only half its cylinders, and the slightly out-of-sync sound of the exhaust, obvious only when the sound was reflected back off a wall near the road. Because only half the cylinders were in use, the sound resembled a truck at low r.p.m., while in fact, r.p.m. were unchanged, with alternating cylinders not firing.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s intended to be completely transparent,&#39;&#39; said Thomas G. Stephens, G.M.&#39;s vice president for vehicle integration, referring to the goal that a driver would not notice the feature. There is only one characteristic G.M. wants the owner to notice, he said: &#39;&#39;What we&#39;re trying to do is get to the point where you went further on a tank of gas.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The technology on display this week was tried out in 1981 when G.M. put an engine in its Cadillacs that could run on four cylinders, six, or all eight, but the owners complained about vibrations, especially when it ran on six, according to company executives. Skipping alternating cylinders is smoother than skipping two out of eight. Another part of the problem, they say, is that 20 years ago computer technology was not advanced enough to support the concept. In the new version, an electronically controlled hydraulic system, which uses ordinary engine oil as the hydraulic fluid, is used to alter the lifters, mechanical connections that make the intake and exhaust valves open and close. The lifters shorten themselves by telescoping, thus closing the valves. The valves switch on or off in a fraction of a second.</p> <p>G.M. plans to introduce the &#39;&#39;displacement on demand&#39;&#39; on about 150,000 vehicles in 2004, rising to 1.5 million units in 2007.</p> <p>The hybrid, also shown off today in a pickup truck, uses a different approach from the two now on the road, the Toyota Prius and the Honda Insight, which use an electric motor to help drive the wheels.</p> <p>As is the case with the Prius and the Insight, G.M.&#39;s design contains a device that can act as a generator or a motor. The device recovers energy when the driver slows down, by converting momentum into current.</p> <p>But the G.M. device does not drive the wheels. Instead, it mainly powers batteries that run the spark plugs and other electrical functions. As a result, engineers say, it replaces the generator that generally requires 2.5 to 3 horsepower to run. Taking over the generator&#39;s function can save as much as 25 percent of the energy  used while cruising on a level road.</p> <p>The G.M. entries are part of a resurgence of experimentation spurred by rising gasoline prices.</p> <p>Earlier this month, for example, United Parcel Service, International Fuel Cells and Solectria, a company that began by making electric cars, signed an agreement to produce a  delivery truck that will run on a fuel cell. The system will use house current to break water down into hydrogen and oxygen, and then load the hydrogen onto the delivery truck. The fuel cell will recombine the hydrogen with oxygen it draws from the atmosphere to create electricity. The project will cost $3 million, half of it from the federal government.</p> <p>But a variety of more conventional technologies are available. For example the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy is preparing a report that estimates costs for raising the fuel economy using &#39;&#39;moderate&#39;&#39; technological advances that are either in use on some vehicles, or about to be put into use.</p> <p>For example, mileage on a car the size of the Ford Taurus, which gets 26.2 miles to the gallon, according to  the Environmental Protection Agency, could be improved with a 10 percent reduction in mass, improvements in aerodynamics and tire rolling resistance, higher-efficiency engines, improved transmissions and an integrated starter-generator like the one on G.M.&#39;s hybrid. Such improvements would raise mileage to 40.8 miles a gallon, or about 56 percent, according to the report and  would add about $1,000 to the price of the Taurus, which now lists for $19,500. Improvements in sport utility vehicles could be proportionally even greater, the report said.</p>
1568167>Ready for Takeoff, With Emphasis on &#39;Off&#39; CONSUMERS are not the only ones impressed by the proliferation of new portable electronic devices. So is the Federal Aviation Administration -- but not favorably. Portable electronic technology is changing faster than air safety rules, according to experts at the agency, the airlines and elsewhere, who are scrambling to keep up.  <p>Wi-Fi cards, wireless modems, hand-helds with wireless e-mail service and even cellphones with games are all what the F.A.A. calls &#39;&#39;intentional emitters,&#39;&#39; devices that put out radio energy at a variety of frequencies.</p> <p>Passengers are carrying them onto planes that have long relied on radio navigation beacons on the ground; lately the planes also need signals from fainter sources orbiting the earth, the Global Positioning System satellites. And the planes often have their own wireless systems for equipment that was added after they were built, like emergency lighting along the aisles.</p> <p>Interference between passengers&#39; devices and the planes&#39; systems is difficult to gauge and probably rare, experts say, but the possibility of stray signals is stirring anxiety.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It is thorny, and it gets messy fast,&#39;&#39; said William E. Winfrey, a specialist in advanced technologies at Delta Air Lines.</p> <p>Mr. Winfrey is a co-chairman, with a Boeing expert, David P. Carson, of a committee established last year at the request of the F.A.A. to explore the problem. Scores of experts from airlines, aircraft equipment makers and consumer electronics companies have been meeting since early 2003 and hope to issue recommendations in about 18 months.</p> <p>Yet new products are entering the market so fast that the committee&#39;s recommendations will be quite broad rather than tied to specific products, Mr. Winfrey said.</p> <p>While travelers may know that cellphones are signal producers and comply with rules banning their use in flight, their understanding of the risks posed by other devices is fuzzier. Passengers with laptops equipped with Wi-Fi cards may turn on the laptop without grasping that it is broadcasting, looking for an access point. Some may turn on a wirelessly equipped hand-held to look at a calendar and forget that it, too, is radiating.</p> <p>And that only accounts for devices in the passenger cabin. A passenger might pack a two-way pager in checked luggage, Mr. Carson said. &#39;&#39;Then you can&#39;t get a hold of it even if you do remember,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The seriousness of the problem is hard to gauge. Mr. Winfrey and Mr. Carson are not certain that there has ever been a problem in flight that was traced directly to electronic interference originating on board. But the idea haunts safety experts.</p> <p>In theory, all devices are putting out radio frequency emissions only in the ranges assigned to them by the Federal Communications Commission and thus should not interfere with each other. But electronics experts worry about signals straying outside the assigned range. Those emissions would not have to be large to cause a problem. Signal strength from Global Positioning System satellites is in the range of one-billionth of a watt at the receiver, so even a faint competing signal could interfere.</p> <p>On the ground, there are also potential safety problems, Mr. Carson said. Hand-held electronics might interrupt a transmission between a cockpit and a tower, for example. If a tower controller issued a clearance for a taxiing plane to cross a runway and then revoked it but the latter transmission was not heard, the result could be catastrophic, he said.</p> <p>While the scheduled carriers have flight attendants who enforce a ban on using wireless devices at high altitudes and on using any electronics below 10,000 feet, charter operators of planes large and small often tell their passengers to feel free to use cellphones, wireless modems, two-way pagers and similar devices.</p> <p>In fact, said Les Dorr, an F.A.A. spokesman, it is the Federal Communications Commission that bans the use of &#39;&#39;land mobile devices&#39;&#39; in flight, although the F.A.A., in an advisory document, supports that restriction. The advisory document also recommends that the airlines prohibit intentional transmitters, but it &#39;&#39;doesn&#39;t carry the force of law,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The burden of proof lies with the aircraft operator, Mr. Dorr said.</p> <p>Most airlines mention only cellphones; some add remote-control toys. Then they refer passengers to a list published in their in-flight magazines, which travelers may read only if they boarded without a hand-held or laptop to entertain them.</p>
1352141>America&#39;s Tires: Worn Down, Overlooked and Underinflated THIRTEEN months after Congress required new tire safety measures, out of concern over Ford Explorer rollovers caused by the failure of Firestone tires, studies by the Transportation Department show that there is still much to be done to improve the safety of the small but crucial patch where rubber meets the road. And the department has already missed a deadline established under the new law. That deadline called for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to issue by the end of November detailed regulations that automakers will have to follow to install the tire-pressure-warning systems that Congress wants on all new cars. In a recent interview, Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge, the agency&#39;s administrator, would say only that the rules would be published soon.  <p>By June, the agency is supposed to issue rules on tire labeling. Staff members say they are likely to meet that deadline.</p> <p>Since tires became an issue, Mr. Runge&#39;s office has completed surveys on the condition of tires on the road, and the results were distressing. Government experts say they do not know if tire problems are worse now than before, because the surveys are the first of their kind. But they show that motorists widely neglect their tires -- and that service stations often don&#39;t help.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Tires tend to be the forgotten part,&#39;&#39; Dr. Runge said. A member of his staff, Roger Kurrus, chief of the Consumer Automotive Safety Information Division, said, &#39;&#39;People just assume that tires are there and they&#39;re safe, with never a second thought.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The studies show how little consideration is given to tires. One indicated that one passenger car in 11 has at least one bald tire. The other shows that more than one car in four has at least one tire underinflated by at least 8 pounds per square inch, or p.s.i.</p> <p>Tires were most likely to be underinflated on older vehicles, especially pickups, sport utilities and vans. Rear tires tended to be most frequently underinflated. The study is posted at www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/ncsa.</p> <p>But even conscientious drivers may find it hard to keep a tire properly inflated. The safety administration collected its data on tire-tread wear at 300 service stations; while there, it checked the air pumps. While more than 90 percent of the stations had pumps, nearly 10 percent were out of order. Of those that worked, fewer than half had tire-pressure gauges for customer use.</p> <p>It is also possible, the agency found, for a vigilant driver to be misled by pressure gauges built into pumps. At the pressure levels typical for cars and S.U.V.&#39;s, nearly 10 percent of the pumps overstated a tire&#39;s pressure by 6 p.s.i. or more. Twenty percent overstated the pressure by 4 p.s.i. or more.</p> <p>Only 139 of the 300 stations surveyed had both working air pumps and working tire-pressure gauges.</p> <p>The obvious solution would be for motorists to buy a gauge, for $2 or so. (Fancy ones cost $20 or more, but the agency staff said they were not any better.) Gauges are available at auto-parts and hardware stores, but are hard to find at gas stations, where the only pencil-shaped item displayed near the cashier is often beef jerky.</p> <p>Dr. Runge saw this as another sign of the problem. &#39;&#39;This is a market economy,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;I&#39;m sure that if you had a big demand for tire gauges, anybody would be happy to sell you one. It&#39;s more evidence that consumers have failed to create a demand for tire gauges, or, for that matter, functioning air pumps.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Underinflated tires can result in tread separation and blowouts. In the case of Explorers, the tire failures tended to flip the vehicles. Underinflation also makes the tire wear faster and wastes gasoline.</p> <p>Overinflation, which was also possible because of bad tire gauges, wears out tires faster, too, and makes the ride rougher.</p> <p>And bald tires provide less traction. Dr. Runge&#39;s agency is beginning a public service campaign that urges drivers to check tire pressure and tread wear; for the latter, it gives the time-honored method of sticking a penny into the tread. If the top of Lincoln&#39;s head is visible, it is time to replace the tire.</p> <p>The surveys found that bald tires were 50 to 80 percent more likely to be underinflated than tires with an acceptable amount of tread. A spokesman for the Rubber Manufacturers Association, Daniel Zielinski, said this was because &#39;&#39;people who drive around on bald tires are probably not checking their tires at all.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>One long-term solution is a system built into the car that warns when the tires are low. But Dr. Runge said it would take many years before all cars had those, and besides, he said, they are not as effective as a $2 gauge.</p> <p>Stung by the Explorer problem, Ford now builds tire monitors into some vehicles. New Windstar minivans are equipped with a low-tire-warning system, which includes an amber dashboard warning light shaped like a cross-section of a radial tire with an exclamation point in the middle. But a recent test by a reporter suggested that pressure changes registered only if they were quite sharp and sustained.</p> <p>With three tires pumped up to 35 p.s.i., the maximum recommended inflation stated on a sticker on the pillar behind the driver&#39;s door, I let 5 pounds of air out of the left rear tire, as measured by my $1.99 pencil-type pressure gauge, and drove a few minutes. I repeated this exercise three times, in an effort to activate the warning. At 20 p.s.i., with the warning symbol still unlighted, I gave up and pumped the tire back up.</p> <p>The Windstar owner&#39;s manual warns, &#39;&#39;The low tire warning system may not detect an underinflated tire under all conditions and is not a substitute for manually checking tires regularly for proper inflation.&#39;&#39; It can be thrown off by uneven tread wear, driving on gravel or snow, driving less than 10 miles -- in truth, I drove only a couple of miles -- and driving with two tires deflated at the same time.</p> <p>The reason is that the system measures pressure only indirectly; it uses the antilock brake components to count the number of times the wheel turns. If one wheel turns more than another, it concludes that the faster wheel has a smaller circumference, a sign of less air pressure. Other designs measure pressure directly and transmit the information back to the dashboard.</p>
1631351>A Cruise Line Starts to Clean Up After Itself Cruise lines, after years of sparring with environmentalists, the Coast Guard and federal prosecutors, now say they are voluntarily cleaning up. Royal Caribbean International, which pleaded guilty in 1999 to 21 felony counts of violating water pollution laws, and paid $18 million in fines, expects to complete its probation in January. But the company, which was convicted mostly for dumping oily wastes and deceiving the Coast Guard about its practices, is moving on to solve another environmental problem, sewage releases from its ships.  <p>In October, it turned on new systems on two ships operated by its Celebrity Cruises subsidiary, the Summit and the Infinity. These are the first advanced wastewater treatment plants that Royal Caribbean is installing on its 29 vessels, a job that it says will take until 2008, with each ship being done as it comes into dry dock for scheduled repairs.</p> <p>The circumstances of its decision are under some dispute. An environmental group, Oceana, had been pressuring the cruise line for 10 months, with stunts like flying a banner-towing airplane back and forth around the ships as they prepared to sail, as guests were on deck and well-wishers on shore waved goodbye. The banner said, &#39;&#39;Got Sewage?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Underneath, the banner said, &#39;&#39;Royal Caribbean Dumps Daily.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The group suspended its campaign after the cruise line announced in May that it would install better equipment. But Capt. William Wright, the senior vice president for safety and environment, said the cruise line&#39;s decision was independent of the environmental group.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There was a period when they were focusing on us as an organization,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;What hasn&#39;t been publicized as much is that what they were asking us publicly to do was very much already in progress.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>He said that his company had delayed making an announcement because it was waiting for the technology to mature.</p> <p>At Oceana, Jackie Savitz, the pollution campaign director, said that the cruise line was trying hard to seem to ignore the pressure it was under. &#39;&#39;We had discussions with them that they later said we didn&#39;t have,&#39;&#39; she said.</p> <p>The wastes involved are different from the ones that led to the cruise line&#39;s indictment in the late 1990&#39;s; those were primarily oil discharges, but also chemicals from the ships&#39; dry-cleaning and photo-developing shops. (The Carnival Corporation, the parent company of Carnival Cruise Line as well as Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, Seabourn Cruise Line and Windstar Cruises, pleaded guilty in April 2002 to some of the same crimes.)</p> <p>The issue now is much more basic: sewage. Big cruise ships can carry 4,000 passengers and crew members, and 100,000 people over the course of a year. Human wastes contribute to dead zones in the sea, algae blooms, contaminated shellfish beds and beach closings, according to environmentalists.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;These cruise ships are going to some of the most pristine parts of our ocean, and they&#39;re going in droves,&#39;&#39; Ms. Savitz said. Noting that a town of 4,000 on shore would have to treat its wastes, but outside Alaska, which requires it, cruise ships do not, she added, &#39;&#39;This loophole really needs to be closed.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Cruise ship operators contend that the pollution they contribute is small relative to sources on shore, and they make up only a small fraction of the ships at sea. They acknowledge, however, that they carry most of the people at sea.</p> <p>Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Representative Sam Farr of California, both Democrats, introduced legislation in the last session of Congress that would have made wastewater treatment equipment mandatory. It drew 9 co-sponsors in the Senate and 42 in the House, but did not get out of committee in either chamber. Backers plan to try again in the next Congress.</p> <p>The industry, though, appears to be moving in that direction on its own. In December 2003, its trade association, the International Council of Cruise Lines, called for accelerated adoption of wastewater treatment technologies, and the use of the equipment when ships are near shore.</p> <p>Captain Wright of Royal Caribbean said he expected all his competitors to follow his company&#39;s lead, although Ms. Savitz said, &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know of any other company that has agreed to upgrade the fleet.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Captain Wright said the cost was about $4 million per vessel, and that solids are separated and held for later burning in incinerators on land. Environmentalists have generally not opposed the burning of sewage solids, because unlike municipal wastes, they do not have the mix of chemicals that creates highly toxic chemicals in the smoke.</p> <p>The other product of the advanced systems is water, which Captain Wright said had the same clarity and lack of odor as a bottle of Evian. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s not something we&#39;re marketing,&#39;&#39; he added.</p> <p>TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT&#39;S REPORT</p>
1759386>As Gas Prices Go Up, Impact Trickles Down; Defending Big Oil John C. Felmy, the chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, the main trade association for the oil business, sounds frustrated. As an undergraduate at Pennsylvania State University, he said, he drove to Boston with his debate team during the Arab oil embargo. More than 30 years later, he can recite the topic for 1973-74 without hesitation: &#39;&#39;Resolved, the federal government should control the supply and utilization of energy in the United States.&#39;&#39;  <p>On the drive back, Mr. Felmy recalled, his group was almost stranded in Connecticut because no gas was available, a result, he said, of government misallocation. Government, Mr. Felmy said, can make energy problems worse.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I thought we&#39;d learned from bad energy policy by now,&#39;&#39; he said, although there are days when he is not so sure. Those are the days when his computer flashes with hate e-mail from people who blame the American oil industry for the rise in oil prices.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;People just simply don&#39;t know the facts,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;but they accuse you of everything you can imagine.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Felmy&#39;s organization has been arguing to anyone who will listen that over the long haul, oil company profits are almost identical to the average for manufacturers in the United States, and that since 1982, the price of petroleum products is up less than the price of pulp and paper or lumber, and only about one-third as much as drugs and pharmaceuticals. But it has been tough going, with the public and with legislators, he said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The politicians are reading all the polls, they know how concerned consumers are, and they are trying to figure out what to do about it,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Some are lashing out, attacking the industry, using information that is simply inaccurate.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Felmy said he was proud of what he did for a living, and he called institute members &#39;&#39;honorable companies.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They&#39;re doing what they should do, what is legally required for their shareholders, unlike other companies you&#39;ve heard about in the news,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;They are managing their business properly, keeping fuels flowing to consumers, even though we&#39;re operating in places where sometimes people are shooting at us.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>His industry, Mr. Felmy said, is &#39;&#39;1.4 million Americans working to keep your gas tank full 24 hours a day.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>MATTHEW L.

698414>Video Nuptials: With This Headset, I Thee Wed THE bride wore an ivory-colored lace gown, a single strand of pearls and a lace cap; the groom wore a tuxedo and a brocade vest. Everything was perfect, until they tried to kiss after exchanging vows. That&#39;s when their headsets got in the way. A small gathering of friends, relatives and gawkers, standing around a stage in the main exhibition hall on the last day of PC Expo in New York, applauded and laughed. Even the officiating judge, who was in Santa Rosa, Calif., had to laugh into his headset. His smiling face was beamed back to a huge television screen in New York as the bride and groom&#39;s images were transmitted to California, courtesy of video cameras whose signals were compressed by computer to fit onto standard telephone lines.  <p>The bicoastal wedding on Thursday of Cassandra Lehman and Chris Thorne was probably the most unusual attention-grabber at PC Expo, one of the big annual industry get-togethers, but not by much. With 803 exhibitors spread over 17.3 acres at the Javits Center -- up about an acre and a half over last year&#39;s show at the center -- there was considerable competition for that honor, even with 120,000 people crowding into the fair during its three-day run. At $36 a square foot for a booth, which ran in size from 100 square feet into the thousands, a lot was on the line, especially for small companies.</p> <p>And some of the smaller ones were quite inventive at protecting their investments. Vision Tek of Gurnee, Ill., which sells chips to upgrade computers, rolled out Upgrade Man, with a cape, a big U on his chest, wraparound sunglasses and a swagger straight out of an Errol Flynn movie. &quot;He&#39;s our best Upgrade Man,&quot; said Cynthia Kater, the marketing manager, who credited him with pulling in a number of good leads.</p> <p>People were also finding their way to the booth run by Penthouse magazine, where the software was softcore: Penthouse models cavorting on CD-ROM disks. What&#39;s more, a computer operator could freeze the action on screen, rearrange images and print them out. There were live models at the booth as well, signing photos of themselves.</p> <p>Elsewhere, many companies displayed software on giant screens to attract a crowd. Some salespeople were reduced to throwing out small packages, each with a rolled-up T-shirt, like herring to seals at the zoo.</p> <p>Amid all the marketing gimmicks there were serious product announcements and speeches. But there was no agreement on a big theme. Some companies said it was multimedia, some said it was portability, some said wireless communications.</p> <p>Andrew S. Grove, chairman of the Intel Corporation, said in a keynote address that it was communications, and that the personal computer was going to be the &quot;information appliance.&quot; He said that the PC was ubiquitous, and on the exhibition floor, Intel salespeople handed out buttons that read, &quot;I know what UBIQUITOUS means.&quot;</p> <p>In fact, though, through the crowded aisles, most reeking of popcorn and hot dogs, a more common theme may have been basketball.</p> <p>Compaq, which was offering four personal computers yoked together to do the job of a mainframe, brought Hakeem Olajuwon to a party and then to the display floor. Mr. Olajuwon, of the Houston Rockets, talked about his team being No. 1 and Compaq being the No. 1 personal computer company, as it was in the first quarter of this year in sales. Nobody reported hearing him say anything more profound about computers, but then, maybe nobody asked him.</p> <p>Computer Associates went for a more direct approach, with a basketball hoop and a sign promising free software to anyone who could sink three out of three shots. But the basketball skills of computer shoppers being what they are, the magic number was soon lowered to two out of three.</p> <p>That was still too much for Kathy Brennan, a senior business consultant at New York Life, who stands a bit over 5 feet and missed the backboard on all three tries.</p> <p>&quot;I was better at the frog thing,&quot; she said, referring to last year&#39;s PC Expo, where she tossed a toy frog and won a teddy bear. &quot;But I don&#39;t like to say I didn&#39;t try something.&quot;</p> <p>That attitude may help explain the wedding, described as the first ever by videoconference, of Ms. Lehman, a 29-year-old assistant professor of computer art at San Jose State University, and Mr. Thorne, 34, president of Riverview Systems Group, a San Jose company that stages audiovisual events for business conferences and trade shows. A retired Superior Court judge, Spurgeon Avakian, officiated from a Pacific Bell studio, where he could see the couple, who were standing at the Symantec Corporation exhibit booth, on his own big TV screen.</p> <p>&quot;A videoconference wedding is a legal union since a judge need only be convinced that the bride and groom are in his presence,&quot; Mr. Avakian said. &quot;This videoconference wedding meets that criteria.&quot;</p> <p>It clearly felt like the real thing to at least one onlooker, Sharon Pagano, a software writer for the state of New Jersey who was taking a training day at the expo: &quot;Wait until we go back to work and tell everyone we went to a wedding!&quot;</p>
1803554>The Basics; To Fix Hubble, an Orbital Complication Every space shuttle flight has its risks, as two catastrophes have made painfully clear, but the one announced last week by NASA to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope in 2008 is riskier than usual. If the shuttle runs into trouble, it won&#39;t be able to rendezvous with the International Space Station for help. The best it could do is collide with it. The reasons have to do with physics and politics, which led the United States and Russia to set the orbits of the Hubble telescope and the space station at different angles to the Equator.  <p>First, the physics. Decades ago, the United States built its main launching pads at Cape Canaveral, Fla., almost as far south as possible, to make it easier for its space vehicles to achieve orbit.</p> <p>Like a rock thrown from a speeding car, a spacecraft launched from a low latitude gets a push from the earth&#39;s rotation -- 1,000 miles an hour at the Equator, tapering to zero at the poles.</p> <p>The Hubble was launched there in 1990 at an angle of 28.5 degrees from the Equator, the lowest angle easily achievable from Cape Canaveral. The minimum angle of orbit equals the latitude of the launch point, and Cape Canaveral is at 28.5 degrees north.</p> <p>Now the politics.</p> <p>The International Space Station was built in a historic partnership with the Russians. As part of the arrangement, the United States agreed that the station would orbit at an angle of 51.6 degrees from the equator. The orbit was chosen so that the Russians could launch components and crews from their site at Baikonur, Kazakhstan, at latitude 45.9 degrees north, to build and service the Space Station.</p> <p>The problem for the 11-day mission planned for 2008 is that the shuttle will have to be launched at an angle of 28.5 degrees to match the Hubble&#39;s orbit. Once the shuttle is launched, though, it will be all but impossible for the spacecraft to change its orbit to detour to the space station in the event of trouble.</p> <p>It is possible for the shuttle to change its altitude to match the altitude of the space station. But a successful rendezvous would require the relative motion of the two spacecraft to be zero. And because the angles of their orbits are different, the two craft would cross paths at several miles per second. Disaster would ensue.</p> <p>MATTHEW L.

1737014>Two Crowded Rivals, Filling Up One Clear Sky FOR years, New York air traffic controllers and their bosses at the Federal Aviation Administration had agreed that New York had the most complicated air traffic in America, because of the high traffic and because the three big airports are so close that a decision to use one runway at Kennedy International Airport precludes the use of another one at La Guardia Airport or Newark Liberty International Airport. This was used to explain why it was hard to attract enough controllers to New York, and why the radar office that handles low-altitude traffic, the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, in Westbury, N.Y., had such high overtime bills. But last summer, the F.A.A. blamed controller abuses and its own lax management for high overtime bills at the Tracon, as it is known, and last week it said that it had sharply cut overtime. The place is not short of staff at all, the agency found. In fact, it is overstaffed.  <p>&#39;&#39;We have controllers all over this country that work complex traffic every day,&#39;&#39; said Bruce Johnson, vice president of the F.A.A.&#39;s division that handles air traffic.</p> <p>Then Bobby Sturgell, the agency&#39;s deputy administrator, delivered a blow to New York City&#39;s reputation. He said a consulting firm, Mitre Corporation in McLean, Va., had performed an analysis that showed the Southern California Tracon, had it worse: New York had lost the perverse distinction of &#39;&#39;worst air traffic in America.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;In terms of total operations, the Southern California Tracon handles more operations than the New York Tracon,&#39;&#39; Mr. Sturgell said. &#39;&#39;On a complexity basis, yes, we do have Newark, we have La Guardia, and we have Kennedy. But in Southern California, we have LAX, Burbank, John Wayne, etc., etc.&#39;&#39; And the area also has mountains and closed military airspace.</p> <p>Phil Barbarello, vice president of the controllers&#39; union for the Eastern region of the United States, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, was skeptical. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve been to California,&#39;&#39; he said in a telephone interview. &#39;&#39;In Southern California, the airports are 50, 60, 100 miles apart. Burbank&#39;s airplanes don&#39;t run into LAX airplanes,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Mitre took the three busiest air traffic sectors in New York and in Southern California and analyzed the instructions that the controllers had to give to pilots: from simply handing off the plane to the next sector to more complicated ones, like having an airplane change altitudes and turn to avoid coming too close to another. Based on data from three days in March 2005, Mitre said the Southern California Tracon was worse.</p> <p>Mr. Barbarello scoffed. &#39;&#39;Whatever they did, they got paid to say it,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>INK</p>
372112>In Rarity, Utility Seeks Another in Midwest In a move that is rare among utilities, the Kansas City Power and Light Company made a hostile tender offer yesterday for the shares of a neighboring utility, the Kansas Gas and Electric Company. Kansas City Power said the bid was worth $857 million.  <p>Analysts said the move had stemmed partly from the two companies&#39; partnership in an over-budget nuclear plant and partly from Kansas City Power&#39;s impending need for a new electric plant. Instead of building such a plant, it was seeking to buy an electric company.</p> <p>Kansas City Power offered $27 a share for Kansas Gas and Electric&#39;s common stock, which had closed Friday at $19.75. Yesterday, Kansas Gas and Electric shares jumped $4.625 each, to close at $24.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. Kansas City Power closed at $31.50, down 87.5 cents, in Big Board trading.</p> <p>If combined, the companies would achieve savings of $85 million in the first five years, Kansas City Power estimated. That would come to about 1.4 percent of the combined revenues of the companies.</p> <p>A spokesman for Kansas Gas and Electric said the company was studying the offer, which it received yesterday morning.</p> <p>The companies are of modest size. Kansas City Power serves the Kansas City metropolitan area in Kansas and Missouri. Kansas Gas and Electric serves south-central and southeastern Kansas, including Wichita.</p> <p>They are partners at the Wolf Creek nuclear plant, near Burlington, Kan., about 100 miles southwest of Kansas City. They set out to build the plant in 1973 for $525 million, but finished it 12 years later for $2.9 billion.</p> <p>In 1985, the Kansas Corporation Commission, the state&#39;s regulatory agency, said the plant was bigger than customers needed, and delayed allowing some of its cost to be passed on to customers. The commission later relented, but it said $283 million of the plant&#39;s cost had resulted from imprudent acts of management and would have to come out of the pockets of shareholders.</p> <p>&#39;The Final Revenge&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Kansas Gas and Electric would not be in this position if they hadn&#39;t built the Wolf Creek plant,&#39;&#39; said Gregory B. Enholm, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. &#39;&#39;This is, in a way, the final revenge of a nuclear power plant - to cause the company to be put out of existence.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Enholm suggested that the opening bid was low. It comes to about 140 percent of the book value of the company, he said, instead of a range of 160 to 200 percent.</p> <p>In a letter sent yesterday to Wilson K. Cadman, the chairman and president of Kansas Gas and Electric, the president and chief executive officer of Kansas City Power, A. Drue Jennings, said that if the bid succeeded, his company would freeze rates for all wholesale and retail customers through Jan. 1, 1993.</p> <p>No Layoffs Expected</p> <p>Mr. Jennings said his company did not expect any layoffs among Kansas Gas and Electric&#39;s 1,330 employees.</p> <p>In a telephone interview, he added that &#39;&#39;the real synergies should be very measurable&#39;&#39; if the companies combined, and that $85 million over five years was a conservative estimate based on publicly available information.</p> <p>He said the offer was all in cash and fully financed. His company said it had executed a $1 billion credit agreement with the Westpac Banking Corporation and the First National Bank of Chicago, and had retained the Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corporation as a financial adviser.</p> <p>Mr. Jennings also said that to assuage the fears of neighboring utilities, it had filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has jurisdiction over wholesale electricity transactions, for changes in policies governing access to its transmission lines. The changes are meant &#39;&#39;to open up the system quite a bit,&#39;&#39; he said, so that other companies could trade power across the combined territory of the merged companies.</p> <p>Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington indicated that the companies had discussed a merger as early as 1983, as well as the possibility that Kansas Gas and Electric would sell generating capacity to Kansas City Power. The filing also says that if the merger is not consummated by the time of Kansas Gas&#39;s annual meeting next year, Kansas City Power would consider soliciting proxies to elect its candidates to the target company&#39;s board.</p> <p>The takeover offer was made conditional on regulatory approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Kansas Corporation Commission, among other conditions.Equitable Life Assurance Societyd (Donaldson, Lufkin)</p>
1296950>Some Hybrid Vehicles Are Here; Their Tax Status Remains Vague Last Thursday, Vice President Dick Cheney released an energy plan that recommended a $2,000 tax credit for hybrid vehicles, which mix gasoline and battery power. In theory, this was new. But it puzzled Bob Zubritsky, who had walked into a showroom in Morristown, N.J., the Saturday before and ordered a Toyota Prius, one of the two hybrids now on the market. The salesman gave him Internal Revenue Service Form 8834, &#39;&#39;Qualified Electric Vehicle Credit,&#39;&#39; which provides for a tax credit up to $4,000 for automobiles &#39;&#39;powered primarily by an electric motor.&#39;&#39;  <p>Is a credit already in effect? It depends on whom you ask. Not even the I.R.S. can say for sure, and therein lies a warning to Congress and the White House about how complicated tax credits can be.</p> <p>The sales manager, Timothy M. Bente, said he had been giving the same form to customers for months. &#39;&#39;Nobody&#39;s called back to complain,&#39;&#39; he said, adding that another customer, a tax professor at Rutgers who liked the Prius but bought a Sienna minivan instead, said that claiming the electric-vehicle credit was legitimate.</p> <p>But an I.R.S. spokesman, Don Roberts, said, &#39;&#39;Unfortunately, this is an area where we have not had any guidance issued.&#39;&#39; Mr. Roberts said he could not find out how many people had tried to take the credit on the Prius, of which Toyota sold several thousand last year, nor whether the I.R.S. had accepted or rejected the claims. And Joseph M. Mikrut, a tax-law counsel at the Treasury, which helped develop the parts of the energy plan involving rebates and tax credits, said the situation was &#39;&#39;murky,&#39;&#39; because the current law, passed as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, did not have hybrids in mind.</p> <p>Only after that law was passed did hybrids appear -- vehicles that run part-time on electric power, but do not have to be plugged in for recharging, as purely electric vehicles do.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I wouldn&#39;t take tax advice from a car dealer,&#39;&#39; Mr. Mikrut added, but he did not have definitive advice of his own.</p> <p>A Toyota spokeswoman, Martha Voss, said the company did not contend that the Prius was eligible for the electric-vehicle credit but that it qualified for a different tax benefit, a $2,000 clean-vehicle deduction that can be claimed on Form 1040.</p> <p>Ed Cohen, a spokesman for Honda, which produces the Insight, the only other hybrid vehicle on the market, said his company did not maintain that the Insight qualified for either the clean-vehicle deduction or the electric-vehicle credit.</p> <p>Both the Insight and the Prius are fueled with gasoline and use some of the power from the internal combustion engine to make electricity. But in the Insight, much less gasoline is turned into electrical energy than in the Prius.</p> <p>At the White House, a spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, said tonight that the Bush administration&#39;s energy proposal &#39;&#39;clarifies and expands the current law.&#39;&#39; She said it did not specify the structure or the dollar amount of tax credits and that this would be worked out with Congress.</p> <p>Mr. Zubritsky would like the credit but is not eager to be a test case. The tax-form instructions, he noted, say that the vehicle must have &#39;&#39;an electric motor drawing current from rechargeable batteries, fuel cells or other portable sources of electric current.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You&#39;re running gasoline to create it,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Zubritsky of Bridgewater, N.J., who works in the financial department of a large corporation that he declined to identify. &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s stored in a battery.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In fact, sometimes it is and sometimes it isn&#39;t. The Prius gasoline motor sometimes drives the wheels directly, sometimes charges up the batteries while the electric motor turns the wheels, and sometimes runs only on electricity. The car does not, however, plug into the wall, which is the type of vehicle that Congress had in mind when it enacted the tax credit.</p> <p>Mr. Roberts of the I.R.S. said that someone in Mr. Zubritsky&#39;s situation could ask for a private-letter ruling, but would have to answer various detailed questions about engineering matters.</p> <p>The ambiguity and the confusion can be expected to spread as other companies offer hybrids; Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler are all planning hybrid models, although some of those seem rather timid in an engineering sense, relying far less on electric drive systems than the Prius does.</p> <p>That brings up the question of when a hybrid rises to the level where it merits a subsidy. For example, a hybridized Dodge Durango, a big sport utility vehicle, would get about 15 miles to a gallon of gasoline instead of 12. That is an improvement, but lower than with a standard sedan, which typically gets well over 20 miles a gallon -- and far behind the Insight coupe or the Prius sedan, which are rated at 48 to 65 miles a gallon.</p> <p>A $2,000 subsidy for a fuel-guzzling hybrid -- even one that saved three miles a gallon, or about 200 gallons a year and perhaps 1,600 gallons over the vehicle&#39;s lifetime -- might not sit well with many taxpayers.</p> <p>The deduction is due to be phased out, with a 25 percent cut next year and similar cuts in 2003 and 2004, reaching zero in 2005.</p> <p>But Mr. Zubritsky has a more immediate concern. He wants to replace his 1995 Mercury Sable, which, he calculates, operates at 22 miles to the gallon, with the Prius, which he expects will go roughly twice as far on a gallon. He thinks he would save about 400 gallons a year, but he has not determined if that would cover the extra cost of buying a hybrid rather than an ordinary small car.</p> <p>Still, he said: &#39;&#39;I happen to be very idealistic. If people really believe these things, someone&#39;s got to step up and put their money where their mouth is.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Zubritsky has not decided if he will try to get the tax credit. He will be on a waiting list for the Prius until August anyway, so he figures that maybe he should wait until January, when a new credit, as worked out in the administration&#39;s energy plan, might take effect.</p> <p>The Rutgers professor, Jay A. Soled, who teaches taxation at the Newark campus, said that if he had bought a Prius, he would have claimed the credit on his return. If a taxpayer&#39;s claim is rejected, he said, &#39;&#39;the only thing they could probably be hit with is they&#39;d be owing $4,000 plus interest.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>And &#39;&#39;because the form was given by a dealer,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;they would not be hit with any penalties.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But Ms. Voss, the Toyota spokeswoman, said the dealer was probably just trying to be helpful, and handing out the wrong form.</p> <p>Not at all, said Mr. Bente, the dealership sales manager. &#39;&#39;The gas engine exists to generate the electricity to drive the car. I don&#39;t see any reason why you can&#39;t jam that one down their throat,&#39;&#39; he said of the I.R.S.</p> <p>Mr. Mikrut of the Treasury said: &#39;&#39;In the 10 years since this was enacted, the technologies and research have changed. The statute perhaps ought to be modified to take that into account.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;What, if anything, these vehicles qualify for under present law is unclear,&#39;&#39; he added.</p>
564173>Hertz Ends &#39;Drop Charges&#39; on One-Way Rentals The Hertz Corporation said yesterday that it would sharply cut the cost of one-way car rentals for nonbusiness travelers, in an attempt to stimulate new trips and attract customers from other rent-a-car companies, the airlines, bus companies and Amtrak. Hertz said that it would immediately eliminate its &quot;drop charges&quot; on intermediate and large cars nationwide in the 800 Hertz locations it owns and that it planned to do the same next month at 700 franchise locations.  <p>But its new &quot;one-way rates,&quot; charged by the day, will be higher than the daily rate for a car rented and returned in the same city.</p> <p>For example, a driver in Washington who wants to go to Atlanta and does not qualify for any corporate discounts will be able to rent a midsized car, like a Ford Tempo, for $90 a day, or $270 for three days. The old rate was $43 a day plus a drop charge of $800, for a total of $929. The rate to rent a car in Washington and to return it there three days later is $43 a day. The prices do not include gasoline, taxes and optional insurance. Hertz&#39;s Rationale</p> <p>Hertz and other rental companies have already eliminated drop charges between many cities, especially in Florida and California. Before yesterday&#39;s announcement, Avis was already offering cheaper rates on many one-way trips. But Hertz believes that it can handle one-way traffic at lower costs than its competitors because it has the biggest network of corporate-owned locations.</p> <p>&quot;The biggest cost, and the reason for drop charges, is that the car goes away from where the owner is, and he has to get that car back, one way or another,&quot; said Brian J. Kennedy, Hertz&#39;s executive vice president for marketing and sales. &quot;You can&#39;t always rent it going back; many times, somebody has to go get it.&quot;</p> <p>But if Hertz owns the rental location in Washington and the one in Atlanta, Mr. Kennedy said, then &quot;as long as the car&#39;s being used and rented, we don&#39;t care where it is.&quot;</p> <p>Hertz acknowledged that on some routes its new policy merely brought it into line with competitors, rather than establishing a lower price for cost-conscious shoppers. But many of the lowest-priced companies do business in far fewer locations.</p> <p>Competitors disputed the significance of Hertz&#39;s announcement. At Avis, Russell L. James, a spokesman, said the announcement amounted to repackaging. &quot;What they have announced is that they are no longer charging for dessert,&quot; he said. &quot;You can buy the entree with dessert now.&quot; If necessary to stay competitive, he said, &quot;We will repackage everywhere, too.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. James acknowledged that eliminating drop charges was easier if the car was traveling between two company-owned locations.</p> <p>Hertz, based in Park Ridge, N.J., said that under its current pricing system, there are extra charges for about 10 percent of its leisure rentals because of where the car was dropped. Other companies said, however, that Hertz&#39;s drop charges were particularly steep. For example, in contrast to Hertz&#39;s $800 fee between Washington and Atlanta, Dollar&#39;s highest fee is $500, for transcontinental rentals. What Competitors Do</p> <p>But the number of renters who actually pay Dollar a drop charge is similarly small, about 9 percent. And a driver who appeared at the Dollar rental counter in Boston or Washington and asked to rent a car to drop in the other city would be turned away. A driver who asked Thrifty Rent-a-Car for the price to take a car from Atlanta to Orlando would be told that the only out-of-state drop-offs allowed from Georgia are in Tennessee.</p> <p>The new move on one-way rentals comes as the car rental industry ends a record-breaking summer, having received a free ride, so to speak, from the boom in business because of the airline fare war. This fall, however, was promising far slower growth.</p> <p>The significance of the new pricing strategy is largest for nonbusiness travelers, because employees of large corporations who rent on business seldom pay drop charges. Most big companies negotiate rates with the rental car companies, at sharp discounts from what individuals pay, and pay far smaller penalties for one-way rentals. Those charges will remain in place.</p> <p>Hertz expects to have the most success with cities 700 to 1,000 miles apart, with travelers driving one way, perhaps with stops or side trips, and flying back. Beyond 1,000 miles, Mr. Kennedy said, the airlines charge such a large premium fare for one-way tickets that a one-way trip by rental car becomes impractical.</p> <p>For a traveler comparing prices between, say, New York and Boston or Washington, the calculation depends mainly on how many people will be making the trip. Hertz said it would rent an intermediate-sized car in Manhattan for $110 a day for three days to any location in the United States. The one-way air fare on the shuttle to Boston or Washington on Delta Air Lines is $140 one way on weekdays and $65 on weekends. Delta offers a $130 round-trip weekday fare if the ticket is bought 14 days in advance, with certain restrictions.  &#39;More Adventurous Trip</p> <p>The airlines said they did not fear the competition from Hertz or other rental-car companies. &quot;It&#39;s going to encourage people to take a trip they might not otherwise have taken, and we&#39;ll be more than happy to fly them one way,&quot; said Neil A. Monroe, a spokesman for Delta. &quot;Anything that stimulates travel is going to be beneficial to the airlines, and this may well encourage people to take a longer trip or a more adventurous trip.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Monroe added that existing round-trip air fares allowed travelers to stop en route at no extra charge, eliminating part of the reason that a traveler might choose to rent a car rather than fly.</p> <p>At American Airlines, Timothy E. Smith, a spokesman, said that on many trips, a passenger who drove one way and flew the other, or drove on one leg of a triangular journey, would lose the benefit of round-trip excursion fares, which are popular with nonbusiness travelers. But, he added, it might generate some additional trips for the airlines.</p>
1743943>U.S. Tells Northeast States To Pay More to Use Tracks After failing in a three-year effort to hand over Amtrak&#39;s Washington-to-Boston tracks, and their costs, to a new federal-state consortium, the Bush administration is seeking tens of millions of dollars in extra fees from states for use of the tracks by commuter railroads. But the states are saying they already have contracts with Amtrak that specify what they should pay, and that Washington has not explained its demand for more money.  <p>In a Feb. 9 letter, three governors -- Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, Ruth Ann Minner of Delaware, and Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, all Democrats -- told Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta, that he had not been &#39;&#39;open and transparent&#39;&#39; in explaining the added charges.</p> <p>As a result of their concerns and other complaints, representatives of 10 agencies, including three from the New York area, will meet with federal transportation officials here next week to discuss the charges and how they should be calculated. &#39;&#39;The states feel their pocket is being picked,&#39;&#39; said Peter A. Peyser Jr., an aide to Mr. Rendell.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Transportation Department, Brian Turmail, said it was following instructions laid out by Congress in the transportation appropriations bill late last year in determining what the states should pay.</p> <p>The department has not said how much it is seeking for the current fiscal year. But the budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, presented by Mr. Bush on Feb. 6, calls for $59 million from the commuter rail agencies. The budget did not say what formula would be used, and Mr. Turmail said the figure could change.</p> <p>Mr. Turmail said that whatever the Transportation Department got from the states would go to Amtrak in addition to its federal grant. A spokesman for Amtrak, however, said officials did not think that collection of money from the states would affect the railroad&#39;s appropriation.</p> <p>The administration has proposed deducting the amount of the additional fees from its own grants to the states, raising further ire among some rail advocates. &#39;&#39;They&#39;re fixing to garnish Federal Transit Administration grants, much in the manner you&#39;d hit up somebody for failing to pay child support,&#39;&#39; said Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Rail Passengers.</p> <p>The Northeast Corridor, which stretches from Washington to Boston, is heavily used by several commuter lines, Amtrak&#39;s intercity trains and even some freight trains.</p> <p>No formula has been set. Mr. Turmail said the assumption was that it would be based on the number of miles traveled by an agency&#39;s trains in a year, unless the department and the commuter lines reached a consensus on a better method.</p> <p>Rail specialists say two other formulas are contenders: car-miles, which takes into account how long the trains are, and ton-miles, based on how much trains weigh and how much wear and tear they impose on tracks.</p> <p>Any of those formulas could hit New Jersey Transit hard, because it operates many trains over long routes. The Long Island Rail Road could be charged more for using Pennsylvania Station in New York City. Metro-North Railroad, which terminates in New Haven, runs on tracks owned by New York and Connecticut, but the Shore Line East, which runs east of New Haven, operates on Amtrak tracks and could be hit for more. Septa, which serves the Philadelphia area, and the commuter systems serving Boston, Wilmington and Baltimore would also be subject to new charges.</p> <p>Mr. Peyser, Governor Rendell&#39;s aide, said the likely result would be that Septa would have less to spend on its capital budget. But Septa could decide to get the money from elsewhere, he said.</p> <p>H. James Boice, the chief of policy and planning at the Connecticut Department of Transportation, said the state paid Amtrak $900,000 a year for the Shore Line East trains to use the tracks, which came to 90 cents per car per mile. When Amtrak used Connecticut-owned tracks from Greenwich to New Haven, it paid just 18 cents per car-mile, he said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;What&#39;s good for the goose is good for the gander,&#39;&#39; Mr. Boice said, meaning there was no reason why Connecticut should pay more to run its cars on Amtrak&#39;s tracks than Amtrak pays the state to run Amtrak cars on Connecticut tracks.</p> <p>Another problem, Mr. Boice said, is that while the Transportation Department is trying to revise the tolls that have been in place for decades for passenger trains, on the theory that other users of the corridor are not paying their fair share, there was no attempt to collect more from freight railroads.</p> <p>Dan Stessel, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit, said it paid more than $100 million a year for improvements on the corridor and had made investments like rebuilding the signal system from Newark through the tunnels under the Hudson River, to allow rail traffic to move faster.</p> <p>The corridor needs about $4 billion over the next few years to return it to a state of good repair, federal officials estimate. Movable bridges in eastern Connecticut and electric cables near Philadelphia are overdue for replacement, they say.</p> <p>Getting more money from commuter agencies was a goal of the Republicans when they took over Congress in the 1990&#39;s. But the issue turned out to be more regional than partisan, and representatives of Northeastern states fought off the idea.</p> <p>Thomas M. Downs, who was president of Amtrak from 1992 to 1998, said the states were worried about bigger and bigger cash demands. But he predicted that Congress would kill the idea of extra charges, or that the White House would think better of it in an election year.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If the control of the Senate is in the balance, what kind of bill do you think they&#39;re going to send to Pennsylvania?&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;What are they going to send to the Republican governor of Maryland who is in a really dicey race for re-election?&#39;&#39;</p>
818441>Airline Ticket Tax May Be Temporarily Dropped in Budget Fight The Federal Aviation Administration said today that the 10 percent airline ticket tax, which it needs to pay for the air traffic control system, would probably be temporarily dropped because of the budget impasse between the White  House and Congress. The loss of the tax, which will expire on Dec. 31 unless it is renewed, would cost the Treasury about $15 million a day but would provide a windfall for air travelers or the airlines.  <p>It may also send hundreds of thousands of passengers to the airlines or the  Internal Revenue Service seeking refunds.</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s ridiculous, quite frankly&quot; said James W. Coon, a staff member at the House Aviation Subcommittee. &quot;You would just hope this budget situation in Washington works itself out.&quot;</p> <p>Renewal of the ticket tax and two others -- the $6 a person fee on international departures and a 6.25 percent tax on air freight -- was in the budget reconciliation bill that President Clinton vetoed earlier this week. Lawrence J. Haas, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, said that the Administration supported extension, but that the President had to veto the budget because of disagreements over Medicaid, Medicare and other issues.</p> <p>&quot;Should there be a better way?&quot; he asked. &quot;Yes, there should be a better way. But in this case our hands are tied.&quot;</p> <p>The airlines have continued to collect the tax on advice from the Internal Revenue Service on the assumption that it would be renewed by now. The aviation  agency assumed the same thing. &quot;But then, I never believed we&#39;d see the Government shut down two times, either,&quot; said Linda Hall Daschle, the Deputy Administrator.</p> <p>The I.R.S. said people who have already bought tickets for travel next year,  including round-trip holiday travel, would be entitled to a refund if the levy was not renewed. But it is up to the airlines to decide whether to reimburse the passengers directly, and then claim the money from the I.R.S., or to tell the passengers to file their own claims with the tax agency, said Wilson Fadely, a spokesman for the F.A.A. Passengers seeking reimbursement of the tax must file Form 8849, Claim for Refund for Excise Taxes.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of people have already bought tickets for travel next year. The tax can be collected on tickets bought until the tax expires, but it is not due on travel taken after the expiration date.</p> <p>On Jan. 1, tickets could get 10 percent cheaper or fares could rise. &quot;They could hide a fare increase in there,&quot; said Geraldine L. Frankoski, director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a nonprofit safety and consumer protection group founded by Ralph Nader in 1971. &quot;They are deregulated and they  can raise their fares for pretty much any reason they want,&quot; she said.</p> <p>Spokesmen for American, United and Delta all said they had not made any decisions on how to make refunds or whether to raise fares. At the Air Transport Association, the trade group for the big airlines, Tim Neale, a spokesman, said: &quot;We are concerned about what we do with our computer reservation systems. If they have to be reprogrammed we can&#39;t do that in a couple of days. We&#39;re looking for some guidance from the Government and not getting it really, because no one  knows what&#39;s going to happen.&quot;</p> <p>For the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30 -- which is the last day that the  Federal Government had a fully functional budget -- the ticket tax brought in $4.88 billion; the departure tax, $244 million, and the air freight tax $324 million.</p>
325586>Robots Transform Coal Mining The four-inch carbide-steel claws of a screaming yellow robot tore relentlessly at the coal seam 1,000 feet below the surface, digging enough in 30 seconds to meet the electric needs of a typical suburban house for a year.  <p>The robot&#39;s human master, old enough to remember when miners used picks and shovels and loaded coal into carts drawn by dogs, strolled beside, periodically pushing buttons on support equipment.</p> <p>Coal mining, an unglamorous business known mostly for accidents and bitter strikes, is going high tech, and the resulting productivity gains are important for a nation that is using up its other fossil fuels.</p> <p>The country&#39;s deposits of coal are expected to last more than a century, while oil reserves will last only 10 years at current rates of production, assuming no more oil is found. Gas reserves are also more limited than coal supplies. As oil and gas are used up, finding and extracting them become more expensive; by contrast, because of technical advances like the robot, the cost of digging coal is falling. Thus, over the long term, the price gap between coal and oil and gas will probably grow, and coal could become an even more important energy resource.</p> <p>A New Mining Method</p> <p>The robot here, in the Consolidation Coal Company&#39;s Blacksville No. 2 mine, 700 to 1,400 feet under the Mason-Dixon line, is perhaps the most advanced in the country. It is but one recent improvement in a highly automated technique called longwall mining, in which coal is removed not by tunneling like a worm through an apple, leaving more of the target than is removed, but by methodically shuttling back and forth across the width of the deposit and devouring nearly everything.</p> <p>Longwall mining has been around for decades but mine operators have recently made the technique far more efficient. The method can now extract about 75 percent of the available coal, compared with 50 percent for conventional mining, which is done largely with machines that dig tunnels. Moreover, the coal can be recovered far more inexpensively.</p> <p>While coal has been hailed as the nation&#39;s energy savior since the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the cost of oil has not risen enough to make coal a good substitute beyond the power plant, where it is burned to produce electricity. Cutting the cost of coal production is a small step toward wider use. When costs justify it, coal can even substitute for gasoline.</p> <p>Extensive Deposits</p> <p>Already, coal is the nation&#39;s biggest indigenous energy source, and its role has been growing. It supplied more than 23.4 percent of all energy consumed in this country, up from 17.5 percent in 1973, the year of the first oil shock, and 19.1 percent in 1979. And it accounted for nearly one-third of all energy produced in this country last year, up from 22.5 percent in 1973. It is the main fuel used to make electricity, providing about 56 percent, and is also the nation&#39;s largest energy export by far.</p> <p>But increased production of coal also raises intense environmental questions. The issues range from the speculative - like the extent of global warming caused by the burning of carbon-rich fuels like coal - to the spooky, like the collapse of land as robot miners pass beneath. The Government is spending more than $5 billion to find cleaner ways to use coal, and the coal companies have tried harder to ameliorate the effects of the collapse, called &#39;&#39;subsidence.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Longwall mining is used wherever coal is present in thick, level seams deep under the ground. (Shallow deposits are often exploited by strip mining, in which the surface layers are scraped away and the coal is excavated from an open pit.) Embracing new technologies and sometimes developing technology on its own, Consolidation Coal, a subsidiary of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, last year mined 55 million tons with 9,500 employees. Fifteen years earlier it took 23,000 workers to mine 55 million tons. A big part of the change was installing 22 longwall machines like the robot here.</p> <p>Despite the loss of employment, the United Mine Workers union generally favors longwall mines. &#39;&#39;Back in the 1950&#39;s, John L. Lewis said it would be far better to have highly productive oprations that were able to pay our folks good wages and benefits than to have 600,000 shovelers living in poverty,&#39;&#39; said John Duray, a spokesman for the union.</p> <p>Called Safer</p> <p>Union officials say longwall mines are also inherently safer in their design, and the mines that can afford them are generally the bigger, better-managed ones.</p> <p>Consol, as the company that operates this mine is known, is by far the biggest longwall operator.</p> <p>In the longwall system at Blacksville 2, miners dig a tunnel the height of the coal seam, and in it they set up a row of floor-to-ceiling steel brackets to hold up the rock and soil above. Sheltered by the shields, the miners install a robot that runs back and forth on a track across the 750-foot-long wall of coal on the open side of the bracket. On each pass, a wheel 4 feet in diameter, studded with claws, chews up the coal in a space extending 3 feet high and 30 inches in front of it. The coal falls to a conveyor belt. At the end of the wall, the robot miner, called a shearer, reverses direction and makes a pass just below the first.</p> <p>When the shearer has finished its second pass, devouring almost all of the six-foot height of the coal seam here, it moves 30 inches forward and starts again. Then, in a sequence worthy of a grade-B science fiction film, each of the 153 steel shields in the row takes it turn stepping forward into the space that the shearer just opened, to be in position for the shearer&#39;s next pass. As they step forward, the earth behind them collapses.</p> <p>The longwall moves forward 17 to 20 feet per eight-hour shift, two or three shifts a day, until it has covered about a mile, over many months. Then, in a few hours, the equipment is moved to another track 750 feet long, and starts work again.</p> <p>Fierce Competition</p> <p>The process can help coal companies achieve enormous efficiencies. Competition among coal producers is vicious, and executives at Consol say they plan to meet it by increasing productivity 3 to 6 percent annually.</p> <p>Setting up a modern mine can cost $100 million, and the chance of making a killing is very small. Unlike the price of oil, the price of coal has been fairly stable since the early 80&#39;s and is not likely to go anywhere soon; when inflation is taken into account, the price of coal is down by 44 percent since 1975.</p> <p>The price varies according to the sulfur content and energy content of the coal. In September, the amount of coal required to make a kilowatt-hour of electricity cost only 54 percent as much as the oil needed for the same job, according to the National Coal Association.</p> <p>Blacksville has two of Consol&#39;s 20 longwall machines. There are only about 100 longwall systems running in the 2,000 underground coal mines in the United States, but they produce about one-third the coal that comes from such mines, and some experts think that figure will rise to more than half by the end of the 90&#39;s.</p> <p>About a third of the nation&#39;s coal comes from surface mining, mostly in the West. The other third comes from underground mines that use older technologies, either because their owners cannot afford longwall machines or because the coal deposits are unsuitable for them.</p> <p>Further Refinements</p> <p>Engineers are now working on additional refinements to longwall mining. For example, operators of the Blacksville 2 mine hope that even pushing the buttons to make the 153 shields step forward - now done by a human - will soon be taken over by the robot&#39;s computer brain.</p> <p>Workers at this mine do not believe that this refinement will cut payrolls further because someone will be needed to watch the robots. At other mines, however, the prospect of installing a longwall machine brings dread because of the layoffs that will come with it.</p> <p>High-tech changes are taking place at the surface, too. In a small factory at the mouth of the mine, the coal is washed in water and other liquids, removing some of the sulfur; it is then dried, crushed and sorted by size. Sometimes it is blended with coal from other mines.</p>
1571491>7 Companies Band Together in Hopes of Building Nation&#39;s First New Nuclear Plant in Decades In an effort to revive the nuclear reactor construction industry, seven major companies plan to announce on Wednesday that they will apply for a license to build a new commercial power plant. The last time a plant was ordered but not later canceled was 1973. The companies, including the two largest nuclear plant owners in the United States and two reactor manufacturers, have not specified what they would build or where. In fact, they have not made a committment to build at all. But they have agreed to spend tens of millions of dollars to get permission to build, and they anticipate tens of millions from the federal government, which requested such proposals in November. The money would go to finish design work useful for a new generation of reactors and to develop a firm estimate of what such plants would cost.  <p>&#39;&#39;In order to keep the nuclear option open for the future, we&#39;ve got to take this next step,&#39;&#39; said Gary J. Taylor, president and chief executive of Entergy Nuclear, a participant.</p> <p>The industry successfully operates existing plants, Mr. Taylor said, but it must build more to sustain itself. &#39;&#39;Without a future, there&#39;s an inability to attract new talent,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It can&#39;t be just any one company,&#39;&#39; Mr. Taylor added. &#39;&#39;Entergy believes it&#39;s going to have to be some sort of consortium.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Other executives said the consortium would help the industry. &#39;&#39;Somebody needs to take the responsibility to advance the momentum, or there won&#39;t be an option,&#39;&#39; said an executive at another company who asked not to be more closely identified before the announcement. &#39;&#39;There haven&#39;t been any orders since Three Mile Island, we&#39;ve got an aging fleet, and at some point they won&#39;t be there any more.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Three Mile Island accident occurred 25 years ago this month. The last orders were placed nine months later, in December 1979, but every one after 1973 was canceled, mostly because of soaring costs. There are 103 commercial reactors now operating; those in service the longest began operation in 1969.</p> <p>The consortium&#39;s other goal is to test a simplified licensing system created by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 12 years ago to help the industry go from reactor order to electricity production in 5 years, as opposed to the 10 or 12 years it took under the previous system.</p> <p>Industry executives say the prospects for new reactor construction are encouraging because of problems facing competing fuels: natural gas prices are persistently high and coal power stations face stiff environmental requirements. Some executives said they hoped their companies would be compensated for making power without emitting gases that contribute to global warming.</p> <p>The generating companies announcing the consortium on Wednesday are Exelon Nuclear, a unit of the Exelon Corporation that owns 17 reactors and is the nation&#39;s largest operator; Entergy Nuclear, a unit of the Entergy Corporation that owns 9 reactors, manages a 10th under contract and is the second-largest operator; Constellation Energy; the Southern Company; and EDF International North America, a subsidiary of Électricité de France, which owns shares in reactors in this country. As for manufacturers, the Westinghouse Electric Company, a BNFL subsidiary that has a design in the late stages of review by the N.R.C., and General Electric, which has a design under preliminary review, are also partners.</p> <p>Whether investors will take the risk depends on estimates of future fuel and electricity prices at the time of approval, participants said. They said that they hoped to submit an application in 2008, and that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission might rule by 2010. By then, the fate of the government&#39;s plan to bury nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, near Las Vegas, might also be clear. The lack of a site for waste disposal is another barrier to new reactor construction.</p>
570744>Cause Unknown for Fatal Pipe Rupture Consolidated Edison officials said yesterday that they did not know how a pipe burst on Tuesday night, letting loose a blast of 500-degree steam that killed a utility mechanic and gravely injured two other men at a Manhattan power station on the East River. A thorough examination of the 40-year-old steel pipe will be delayed while contractors clean up asbestos that the steam spread over a courtyard and driveway opening onto First Avenue at the end of East 39th Street. A preliminary examination showed that the half-inch-thick steel of the pipe had been peeled back by the rush of steam to create a four-foot oval gash. No one was working on the pipe at the time, Con Ed officials said.  <p>Several days ago, Con Ed closed a pipe that connects the north half of the Waterside plant to the pipes that carry steam under the streets, for maintenance. Then the utility detoured the steam, which heats buildings in Manhattan, through the south half of the plant. It was the pipe that connects the halves that ruptured.  Air Samples Taken</p> <p>The company initially said it did not believe that the explosion had spread any asbestos at the Waterside plant, but the city Department of Environmental Protection said that some asbestos had escaped onto First Avenue. Air samples taken by the city during the steam release showed no abnormal asbestos levels, said Babu Thomas, director of enforcement in the Department of Environmental Protection&#39;s asbestos control program.</p> <p>The dead man was identified by Con Edison as Eugene Murtha, 58 years old, of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.  Mr. Murtha, who started with Con Ed in 1966, had been working on an electric fan on the seventh level of the plant. His body was found on the ninth level.</p> <p>In the roaring, blinding scene of confusion that followed the pipe break, five firefighters who arrived at 9:17 P.M., 10 minutes after the break, were erroneously told that people were still trapped in the plant and set out to find them. One of the firefighters, a captain now in critical condition at the burn unit of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, suffered extensive burns internally and externally when the straps of his air pack became tangled in a stairwell. Four others suffered burns as they took turns trying to pull the captain to safety.</p> <p>&quot;The rescuers became the rescued,&quot; said Lieut. Andrew Clark, a spokesman for the Fire Department.</p> <p>The captain, Martin McTigue, 48 years old, of Rescue Company 4, Woodside, Queens, was listed in critical but stable condition yesterday, said a hospital spokeswoman. Also listed as critical but stable was Bogdan Puchalski, 37, an employee of the Ogden Corporation, who was at the plant removing asbestos under contract with Con Ed. Mr. Puchalski also had internal and external burns.</p> <p>Mayor David N. Dinkins went to the hospital to visit the firefighters, and met with Captain McTigue&#39;s wife, Patricia, and their four daughters, Mary, 20, Jean, 19, Christine, 16, and Bridget, 14.</p> <p>Dr. Cleon W. Goodwin, director of the burn center, said that breathing tubes had been inserted in the two men to prevent throat tissue from swelling and choking them. There is no direct treatment for internal burns, he said.</p> <p>&quot;If you take 100 patients who have these large burns and steam inhalation, approximately half will not survive an injury like this,&quot; he said. He added that the extent of their injuries was not yet clear. The two men are on morphine but are conscious, he said.</p> <p>A second firefighter, William Boltja, 35, was also in the burn unit with a back injury and second-degree burns on his legs. Three others who had facial burns spent the night at the burn unit but were discharged yesterday morning. Workers Thought to Be Inside</p> <p>Lieut. Jack Duggan said that when the team arrived from Queens, filling in for a Manhattan unit that was busy elsewhere, &quot;there was a sign-in sheet of Con Ed indicating that there were 14 to 16 people still in the building.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;They were in there, doing their search, when their position became untenable and he became entangled in an iron railing in a stairwell,&quot; Lieutenant Duggan said, referring to Captain McTigue, a 23-year veteran firefighter.</p> <p>There was no one home at the Murtha home yesterday. Mr. Murtha&#39;s family arrived at Waterside at 1:45 A.M. Wednesday to identify his body.</p> <p>Executives at Mr. Puchalski&#39;s company, Ogden, were not able to provide any information about the injured worker.</p> <p>The Waterside plant, opened in 1901, is the oldest in the city that is still in use, but nearly all the equipment in the red-brick building is far younger. The age of the 40-year-old pipe is not unusual, said Dan Walden, a Con Ed spokesman. He said some pipes in the system, which serves Manhattan south of 96th Street, are nearly 100 years old. &quot;The one thing that&#39;s unusual about this pipe is it is not underground,&quot; Mr. Walden said.</p> <p>The pipe, which generally carries 400,000 pounds of steam an hour at 500 degrees, will be examined by outside experts, including metallurgists, he said. Waterside, which burns gas or oil and is used to make electricity in peak periods, was producing only steam at the time of the accident, and only two of its four boilers were in use. Because the weather is not especially cold, the company said, it would have no trouble meeting steam demand using other plants on the system.</p> <p>Around the country, ruptures of steam pipes are not infrequent. Sometimes they are caused by chemical reactions that gradually wear away pipe walls. Sometimes they are caused by water moving through the system and slamming into weak spots.</p> <p>In this case, the break occurred on the inside edge of a 90-degree bend, near the top surface, according to the company.</p> <p>Yesterday afternoon workers with paintbrushes, in anti-contamination suits and respirators, painstakingly swept asbestos from the driveway that leads from the courtyard where the pipe burst onto First Avenue.</p> <p>Con Edison said that Waterside was structurally sound and that workers were checking electrical components for moisture. It could be restarted in a few days, the company said.</p>
1721243>Small Leak at Indian Point Eludes Diver and Cameras A drop of radioactive water leaks every minute from the pool that stores the spent fuel rods at Indian Point 2 here. The water is captured in a plastic sheet and then channeled into a plastic bottle for disposal. It adds up to a quart or two a day. Federal officials and the plant&#39;s owners say there is no danger from the leaking water, which contains tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen. But plant operators have still not pinpointed the source. And because the plant was built when detection systems were not required, the leak went unnoticed until discovered almost by chance when workers excavating around the pool noticed dampness in the surrounding dirt.  <p>The leak, which was found in September, has been the latest worry for local officials and nearby residents concerned about the Indian Point nuclear reactors. It comes on top of repeated failures in tests of the plant&#39;s sirens, which are meant to warn of an emergency. Federal security experts also began a reassessment of the plant&#39;s security in September, which they have declined to discuss.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It added on to the other issues that we have with Indian Point, like the sirens,&#39;&#39; Susan Tolchin, a spokeswoman for Westchester County, said. She also raised the question of whether the leak was the only one.</p> <p>Plant officials have been searching for the source of the leak for two months. They have lowered remote-controlled cameras into the 35-foot-deep pool that stores spent fuel rods, and they even sent a diver wearing radiation monitors to look at flaws found by the camera for evidence of the leak, with no luck.</p> <p>While there is no assurance that the leak can be fixed, Don Leach, a project manager at Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns the reactor, said, &#39;&#39;We are going to do everything we can to get there.&#39;&#39; Monitoring wells are also being drilled to detect contamination.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;re required to monitor and control our releases, so this is something we have to deal with,&#39;&#39; said Don Mayer, a radiological engineer who has been involved in finding the source of the leak. Even so, he said, from the standpoint of the environment, health risks and safety risks, it is almost negligible. &#39;&#39;The offsite dose is essentially zero,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Indian Point&#39;s first plan for stopping the leak was to bring in a diver that Entergy hired, Tim Fisher, 39, of Tucson, who said he has been working as a commercial diver for 17 years. His company, Underwater Construction Corporation of Essex, Conn., has sent him into lakes and rivers and to about 15 nuclear plants to repair parts that must be kept submersed to limit radiation. Mr. Fisher examined three spots in the Indian Point pool, but none of them were the source of the leak.</p> <p>Mr. Fisher goes into the pool with a radiation monitor on each arm, each leg, his back and his head. Readings are instantaneously fed to the surface.</p> <p>After a series of dives, he recently sat with a colleague, Rene Breault, as they dubbed video images of the pool&#39;s inner liner and of Mr. Fisher&#39;s dive onto compact discs. Stuck to the wall near his workstation with a piece of duct tape, a hand-written note showed how much radiation exposure he could absorb before the end of this year. Under the plant&#39;s rule, he is limited to 1,167 millirem, the amount that the average American absorbs in about three and a half years from natural and man-made sources. He said he was unlikely to get close to that amount on this job; in his last dive, he absorbed about 15 millirem, he said.</p> <p>He professed little concern about working a few feet from the highly radioactive fuel, which is stored in water that acts as a radiation shield. &#39;&#39;Whatever it takes,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>He has explored almost all of the pool area that is accessible to humans. Soon Entergy will begin with a smaller camera that can squeeze into the bottom 15 feet of the pool, the area between the side of the fuel rods and the wall. Finding the source of the leak there would be reassuring, company officials say, because they would know where it is, although it is not clear how they would repair it.</p> <p>Tritium levels above the drinking water limit have been found at only one monitoring well near the storage pool, and no wells in the area are used for drinking water, company officials say. Tritium is produced as a byproduct in nuclear reactors producing electricity. Small amounts are routinely released as plants like Indian Point continuously filter out radioactive contaminants like strontium and cesium from water from its reactors, and release the water.</p> <p>In large amounts, tritium can damage internal organs if swallowed. But unlike many radioactive atoms made in reactors, tritium does not persist in the body.</p> <p>To put the leak in perspective, officials say the two Indian Point operating reactors legally discharge into the Hudson every year an amount of tritium 18,000 times greater than what is now leaking.</p> <p>That has not stopped plant opponents from raising concerns about the leak.</p> <p>Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, recently met with the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and called for a &#39;&#39;comprehensive plan&#39;&#39; to deal with the leak, as well as swifter notification of local officials whenever there are problems at the plant. Earlier this month the commission promised enhanced oversight, Mrs. Clinton announced. Representative Sue Kelly, Republican of New York, who represents the Congressional district near the plant, complained that &#39;&#39;the N.R.C. is not deeming this investigation as the urgent priority that the rest of us living around Indian Point recognize it to be.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Much larger tritium leaks at two other reactors have contributed to their shutdowns in recent years. In 1997 a research reactor at Brookhaven National Laboratory was found to have been leaking tritium for at least a decade, contaminating an aquifer used for drinking water with concentrations above the safety limit. And in 1998 another research reactor, one used for making tritium for nuclear reactors, spilled 150 gallons of tritium-contaminated water into the Savannah River.</p> <p>Another plant, the Connecticut Yankee reactor in Haddam Neck, Conn., had apparently leaked several gallons a day of water laced with tritium, officials determined as they began tearing it down. The plant ceased operations in 1996 when the owners decided it was uneconomic to continue.</p> <p>Salem, in southern New Jersey, was found three years ago to be leaking water containing a variety of radioactive materials, including tritium, which contaminated the groundwater there. State officials said at the time that the amounts did not pose an immediate health risk.</p>
577504>U.S. Finds Energy Industry Subsidies Are Small An Energy Department study of Government subsidies to the energy industry has concluded that the amounts involved are small and do not affect consumption much. But an evaluation by a prominent electricity analyst finds enormous subsidies for the nuclear industry, along with enormous costs incurred directly by the utilities. The question of which energy forms the Government should support is drawing increased attention with the change of administrations. President Jimmy Carter won huge increases in Federal support for renewable energy resources and plans to replace oil with fuels derived from coal and other sources. As Presidents, Ronald Reagan and George Bush vigorously backed nuclear power. President-elect Bill Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore have talked about returning to renewable fuels and promoting natural gas and conservation.  A Contrarian View The Government study, released Wednesday, contradicts some conventional thinking about Washington&#39;s role in energy prices. It  <p>The Government study, released Wednesday, contradicts some conventional thinking about Washington&#39;s role in energy prices. It found, for example, that the oil industry, thought of as pampered with Government support, paid more in taxes than it got in benefits.</p> <p>The study says a shift to conservation and use of renewable sources of energy, which the Clinton team advocates, has to a large extent already occurred.</p> <p>The study, ordered by Congress last year, concludes that Government subsidies to the energy industry are equal to 1 to 3 percent of the value of all energy consumed, or $5 billion to $13 billion a year, depending on how a subsidy is defined.</p> <p>The nation&#39;s total yearly energy bill is $475 billion, the study found.</p> <p>&quot;Contrary to what might be the popular impression, energy is not heavily subsidized,&quot; said Calvin A. Kent, administrator of the Energy Information Administration, an independent statistical agency within the Energy Department.</p> <p>But the study did find that some energy sources, like gasohol and natural gas recovery from coal seams, existed only because of subsidies.</p> <p>In contrast, a separate study to be released in a few days by Greenpeace, the environmental group, concludes that taxpayers have spent nearly $100 billion to promote nuclear power. The total, stated in 1990 dollars to account for inflation since the first expenditures in the early 1950&#39;s, said the subsidy amounted to 1.6 cents for every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced with nuclear power from 1968, when the first large plants began operating, until 1990. &#39;An Official Technology&#39;</p> <p>The Greenpeace study was written by Charles Komanoff, a New York-based electricity analyst who has been comparing the costs of competing sources for 20 years, and an associate, Cora Roelofs. It excludes benefits received from Washington by the nuclear industry like &quot;the ideological support which crowned nuclear power an &#39;official technology&#39; and won investor confidence.&quot;</p> <p>The study puts the total cost of a nuclear kilowatt-hour at just over 10 cents. The figure includes $347 billion spent to build, fuel and operate reactors and to begin programs to tear them down when they retire. The utilities have spent $48 billion on indirect costs, including waste disposal and investments in plants that were canceled. Both numbers were stated in 1990 dollars.</p> <p>In contrast to the 10-cent figure, which is a wholesale figure, the average cost of a kilowatt hour to all customers in the first eight months of this year was 6.6 cents, according to the Energy Department.</p> <p>Mr. Komanoff said the investments in nuclear power had not been worthwhile, adding that they were a warning &quot;to be more tolerant of teething costs for renewables and energy efficiency.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I don&#39;t mean that I or anyone else wants to spend half a trillion dollars on solar energy or wind,&quot; he said. &quot;But when you see eyebrows being raised because a couple of hundred million is going to photovoltaic solar cells or a wind farm, you have to put it in perspective.&quot;</p> <p>The Government study also found a heavy subsidy for nuclear power but did not compare the figure with the cost per kilowatt hour. It found that for fiscal 1992, direct appropriations for nuclear power were $890 million for research and development and $9 million in regulatory costs borne by taxpayers.</p> <p>But nuclear power also has benefits separate from Congressional appropriations: it enjoys a partial exemption from liability for reactor accidents, which the study valued at $3 billion a year in reduced insurance costs.</p> <p>The sector getting the most help, through subsidized loans and Government sales at below-market prices, is electricity, at $1.8 billion, the study found. In contrast, it said the oil industry lost nearly $2.2 billion to the Government, when comparing the value of its tax breaks with the Federal excise taxes on fuel.</p> <p>Dr. Kent said the study did not rank sectors of the energy industry by size of subsidy because many different assumptions went into the counting. But if subsidies were counted on the basis of quantity of energy produced compared with subsidies received, renewable sources, which include solar power, hydroelectricity, wood, wind and other technologies that do not consume fossil fuels, would get $847 million in the current fiscal year. This includes $244 million in research and development funds plus $540 million in tax exemptions and $63 million for help to low-income people.</p> <p>The coal industry is subsidized with $1.1 billion, the study said, with the largest item being $551 million for research into cleaner ways to burn the fuel.</p> <p>Taxpayers will spend $635 million this year to subsidize conservation, the department said. The natural gas industry gets $1.7 billion.</p>
855457>Safety Panel Urges Evaluation Of How Airlines Handle Cargo The National Transportation Safety Board urgently recommended today that the  Federal Aviation Administration evaluate airline procedures to keep &quot;undeclared  or unauthorized hazardous materials&quot; out of their cargo holds. Three weeks ago, improperly labeled and packaged chemicals apparently touched off a fire that led to the crash of a DC-9 in the Everglades, killing all 110 on board.  <p>The plane, a Valujet flight from Miami to Atlanta, carried scores of oxygen  generators, which are thermos-sized chemical reactors that are carried on some planes to make oxygen for passenger emergency masks. The generators, which produce large amounts of heat when set off to produce oxygen, were shipped in boxes that were erroneously described as &quot;empty.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;The Safety Board is concerned, based on the facts developed during the Valujet flight 592 accident investigation, that the practices, procedures and training of the personnel involved in the identification and handling of hazardous material remain inadequate,&quot; the board said in a letter to David R. Hinson, the administrator of the aviation agency.</p> <p>This evening, Mr. Hinson said &quot;we agree with the thrust of the recommendations.&quot;</p> <p>The safety board also said oxidizers, the class of chemicals that includes the oxygen generators in the Valujet crash, should not be transported in cargo compartments that lack smoke or fire detectors; Mr. Hinson responded that his agency had already begun a review of how oxidizers are shipped. The safety board is an independent agency chartered by Congress to make recommendations to regulatory authorities at all levels of government. The F.A.A. usually, but not always, follows the recommendations; for example, the safety board noted in the letter today that it had previously called for smoke detectors and fire extinguishers for cargo holds but that the aviation agency decided against such precautions.</p> <p>The letter said a Pan Am Boeing 707 cargo plane crashed in November 1973 at Logan International Airport in Boston because of a fire started by materials that were improperly packaged. In addition, it cited a DC-10 parked at O&#39;Hare International Airport in Chicago was destroyed by a fire after a technician mishandled an oxygen generator and an an American Airlines DC-9 had a fire in midflight in February 1988 because of unlabeled hazardous materials. That plane  landed safely.</p> <p>The letter said that the cause of the Everglades crash was still under investigation but that there might have been as many as 144 oxygen generators on board, which &quot;created an extremely dangerous condition.&quot; They had been shipped without the protective caps that block them from being set off, the board said.</p> <p>The generators had been removed from other Valujet planes by a contractor after their shelf life had expired, but they had not been &quot;fired,&quot; meaning that  the oxygen-producing chemical reaction had not been set off. Such a step would have changed the generators from a hazard capable of starting fires to a chemical compound that can no longer burn or explode. It is mildly hazardous because it includes toxic barium salts, but it is enclosed in a stainless-steel  canister.</p> <p>Valujet and a contractor that had removed the generators from other Valujet  aircraft, Sabretech, have publicly disagreed over whose fault it was that the generators were not fired.</p> <p>The generators were loaded into the forward cargo hold, where they appear to  have started a fire or caused an explosion shortly after takeoff, leading to the DC-9&#39;s crash.</p> <p>Valujet is not authorized to carry as cargo hazardous materials like oxygen  generators, and says it would have turned this shipment away if it had been properly labeled. But the recommendations issued today indicate that the Board believes that at least part of the responsibility lies with the airline.</p> <p>The board said the evaluation it recommends should cover the training of ramp personnel and others involved in cargo handling.</p> <p>It also said that a temporary ban on air shipment of live oxygen generators  as cargo, made last week by the Department of Transportation, should be made permanent for oxygen generators that have not been spent.</p>
640753>Agency Says Motorman&#39;s Error May Have Caused Accident The Brooklyn subway crash on Thursday was caused by a train operator who intentionally ran a red light and who then probably tried to cover it up, Transit Authority officials said yesterday. The crash, which officials said was the first involving two passenger trains since July 1981, pointed to a systemwide problem in insuring rider safety: the near total reliance on operators to follow the rules. Forty-two passengers were sent to hospitals and three remained hospitalized, all in stable condition.  <p>&quot;We have a level of protection which has historically served us well,&quot; said Thomas F. Prendergast, senior vice president of rapid transit for the authority. &quot;But we are still heavily dependent on the operators to follow rules and procedures.&quot; A Former Car Cleaner</p> <p>The Transit Authority said it was too early to determine whether the crash at the Graham Avenue stop on the L line would prompt it to re-examine how operators are hired and trained. The operator who caused the crash, a two-year veteran who had driven the route since the end of July, had worked his way up through the ranks as a car cleaner, a common path of advancement in the authority.</p> <p>The motorman has been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. If the accident is found to have been caused by the operator&#39;s negligence, the Transit Authority will move to dismiss him, said Termaine Garden, an authority spokesman. He said that the District Attorney does not usually consider criminal charges in subway accidents and that the matter would probably be handled within the authority. An exception was the prosecution of the motorman in the 1991 accident in Union Square that killed six.</p> <p>In the 12 months ending Aug. 1 of this year, 76 operators were charged with running a red signal. Three were demoted, 38 were suspended without pay, 10 received warnings or reprimands and 13 were exonerated. The other cases are still in arbitration.  No Apparent Mechanical Problems</p> <p>Early indications are that no mechanical problems contributed to the L line crash, although the design of the signal system, which is 60 to 70 years old, offers significantly less protection than newer, computerized train control equipment used in other cities.</p> <p>Two other, contributing factors are under investigation: a crucial signal that could have been misinterpreted by an overconfident operator, and an automatic safety system that may have functioned as intended but was easily overriden by the operator.</p> <p>The operator, whom the authority would not identify until its investigation and disciplinary proceedings are over, gave officials a confused account of what happened. He said he had run his eight-car train around a sharp curve after he saw a white signal light that indicated that there was no train ahead. But there is no such light on that stretch of track, between the Grand Street and Graham Avenue stations. His train, weighing 320 tons, hit another train of the same weight that was waiting in the Graham Avenue station and pushed it about five feet, leading investigators to conclude that the train was moving at 10 to 15 miles an hour. They have not determined yet whether the brakes were on at the time of the impact.</p> <p>The crash also shook up riders&#39; confidence in the subway system, especially on the L line.</p> <p>&quot;Motormen have a lot of people who count on them to do the right thing,&quot; said Arrow Brown, who was getting off the L train yesterday at Graham Avenue. Train operators have casual attitudes, he said: &quot;That&#39;s not right. It&#39;s a sign of pervasive societal neglect.&quot;</p> <p>Doreen Ryan, a 23-year-old secretary at New York University, said: &quot;The first thing that flashed through my mind was the accident at Union Square. Sometimes these trains do go at a very high speed. You could be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I&#39;m looking for an apartment in Manhattan so I won&#39;t have to take the train anymore.&quot;  Modernization Scheduled</p> <p>The L line is near the top of the list of places where the Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to modernize the signal and control system, because the line is old and isolated from the rest of the subway network. But the work is not scheduled to be completed before well into the next century.</p> <p>Mr. Prendergast said yesterday that the operator tested negative for drugs and alcohol. The breath and urine tests were performed in a Transit Authority lab within two hours of the accident, which happened at about 5:20 P.M. on Thursday.</p> <p>As reconstructed by Transit Authority officials and an investigator from the New York State Public Transportation Safety Board yesterday afternoon, minor mechanical failures snowballed into a major accident because of violations by the operator.</p> <p>According to their preliminary account, signal problems developed in Manhattan on the Brooklyn-bound tracks. The problems created delays causing a gap in the spacing of southbound trains. Controllers decided to fill the gap by reversing a northbound train in Manhattan and sending it back to Brooklyn.  Changing Tracks</p> <p>To allow that train to change tracks, controllers held Train No. 1654, which was bound for Manhattan, in the Graham Avenue station in Brooklyn. It sat at the platform with the doors open for more than two minutes. Train 1658, the next train bound for Manhattan, pulled out of the Grand Street station normally, passing an amber signal, and proceeded 470 feet toward another signal that sits between the stations at the beginning of a sharp curve.</p> <p>That signal, called a grade timer signal, is usually red, not to stop trains but to slow them down to the posted limit of 10 miles an hour. It will turn amber if the train, which does not have a speedometer, approaches slowly. The signal can also be red if a train is ahead, as was the case Thursday because of the delays.</p> <p>Officials say that the signal has already been found to be operating normally, and Mr. Prendergast said he was &quot;reasonably certain&quot; that the operator went through it while it was red.</p> <p>A safety system is supposed to stop the train if it runs a signal at more than 10 miles an hour. When a train passes and a signal turns red, a small metal bar called a stop arm rises from the track bed, tripping a piece of metal on the train called a trip cock. If it hits the stop arm at more than a crawl, the emergency brakes on the train are tripped.</p> <p>But if that happens, the operator can recharge them with compressed air, which takes a minute to a minute and a half. Passengers, accustomed to frequent unexplained halts in the tunnels, may never notice if the train was not moving very fast to begin with, investigators say. Saw a &#39;Lunar Signal&#39;</p> <p>The operator in this case told investigators that he did not run the red signal, and also said that he saw a &quot;lunar signal,&quot; a white, moonlike signal that indicated that there was no train ahead. The Transit Authority has installed such lights at some signals to indicate that the reason they are red is because of the speed limit, not because a train is ahead. But this particular signal does not have a lunar signal attached, officials said yesterday.</p> <p>On running past the red signal, operators are supposed to stop and radio for instructions, to find out, among other things, if there is a train ahead. In this case, investigators believe, the operator may have recharged the brakes and started up quickly so no one would noticed his error.</p> <p>Investigators say that on Thursday the stop arm on the tracks hit the trip cock on the train and that they found skid marks on the tracks indicating that the emergency brakes worked.</p>
486581>Weicker Drops State From Regional Clean-Air Effort Setting his state on a course independent of 11 other Northeastern states from Maine to Virginia, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said yesterday that Connecticut would not accept strict new standards on automobile emissions as part of a regional effort to control smog. The other states have agreed among themselves to use a plan adopted by California that will eventually require cars that run on alternate fuels like natural gas, methanol and electricity. The plan phases in tighter controls on hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide, two chemical ingredients of smog, produced by cars powered by gasoline.  <p>&quot;Nobody knows what this technology is about,&quot; said Mr. Weicker when asked by reporters in Hartford yesterday morning. &quot;Everybody is saying we want to do something, without knowing what it is they&#39;re going to go ahead and do. And it&#39;s very very expensive.&quot;  Support from Car Makers</p> <p>There is no legal requirement for the states to act jointly. The issue has been argued mostly among environmentalists and health advocates on one side, and auto and oil companies on the other, with little sign of interest from the general public.</p> <p>With the rest of the Northeast moving rapidly to adopt the California program, some officials predicted yesterday that Connecticut would be swept along because auto makers would not bother to ship a different version of a car to an island with looser standards in the center of the Northeast market. Car dealers now swap unsold cars among themselves across state lines as they find customers for individual vehicles.</p> <p>However, at General Motors, Alan R. Weverstad, the manager of emissions compliance, applauded Mr. Weicker&#39;s action and said his company would probably ship the cars demanded by the Connecticut market.  &quot;The residents of Connecticut will be afforded a better model mix and less cost,&quot; he said.</p> <p>If Connecticut goes its own way, car buyers who want to register a vehicle in that state will have to buy it there. While states in the Northeast generally have not worked through the details, California forbids registration of a car that does not meet its emission standards if it has less than 7,500 miles on the odometer.</p> <p>Most officials in neighboring states responded in measured terms to Mr. Weicker&#39;s decision, stressing that they hoped he would eventually change his mind. Still, they were not reticent about their disappointment, with some of the sharpest reaction coming from Thomas C. Jorling, New York&#39;s environment commissioner and a major force behind the multistate agreement. Starting With 1996 Models</p> <p>He predicted that someday Connecticut would have to deal with its pollution problems by banning automobile use on some days, and putting controls on lawnmowers and barbecue grills, or making decisions on development that would curb economic growth.</p> <p>In a telephone interview Mr. Jorling said, &quot;they&#39;re willing to enjoy the benefits of increased reductions, but they&#39;re unwilling to participate in making reductions for their own citizens and the downwind states.&quot;</p> <p>Even if Connecticut had decided to adopt the California standards for low-emission cars, it would not have made much difference in cutting pollution until well into the next century. The first cars with the equipment will not be available until the 1996 or 1997 model years, and it would take years after that before many of the cars on the road had the new equipment.</p> <p>Mr. Weicker, who was a maverick Republican in the United States Senate before being elected Governor of Connecticut as an Independent, said he would keep an open mind and might reverse himself with new evidence, but said, &quot;I am not convinced at this time as to the costs and the benefits.&quot;</p> <p>In a statement explaining Connecticut&#39;s decision, Timothy R. E. Keeney, the commissioner of environmental protection, said the cost of the equipment would run $470 a car, and &quot;economic models show that when you send that kind of money to Detroit, something has to give at home.&quot; The state&#39;s economy would contract if cars cost more, he said, and the result would be a loss of 1,300 to 8,000 jobs.</p> <p>Car manufacturers have said the cost could run $1,000 a vehicle, while California experts say it would probably be under $200.</p> <p>Connecticut has concluded that adopting California&#39;s program would remove pollutants at a cost that might be $15,000 per ton. The other states relied on a joint study that put the cost per ton of less than $3,400.</p> <p>All pollutants drift across state lines with the wind, but smog -- or, more properly, ozone -- is a particular problem for downwind states. It takes hours for nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons, baked by the sun, to produce ozone, which is how rural areas can develop dangerous ozone levels.</p> <p>In Massachusetts, which is usually downwind, Daniel S. Greenbaum, the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, said the Massachusetts Governor, William F. Weld, had become a supporter of the program in part because of the pleadings of the Governor of Maine, John R. McKernan Jr. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t be polluting Acadia State Park in Maine any more than Connecticut should be polluting Cape Cod,&quot; Mr. Greenbaum said.</p> <p>Yesterday, as Governor Weicker explained his decision to reporters, Rhode Island decided to join the multistate agreement. New York has been leading the call for adoption of the California standards, an option that the states were given by the Federal Clean Air Act. In Massachusetts, the Legislature has voted to adopt the standards. Last week the Governor of Vermont, Howard Dean, endorsed the plan and said he would submit it to that state&#39;s legislature. The other two New England states, New Hampshire and Maine, have also agreed, as have New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.</p> <p>Connecticut has said it will require cleaner gasoline, force gas stations to install equipment to recapture pollutant-laden fumes that are released in refueling, and make inspections stricter, among other steps. But Paul G. Billings, a lobbyist at the American Lung Association said, &quot;they have not done anything more than announce what the law requires them to do.&quot;</p>
748647>Postcards From the Lap PEOPLE who take business trips with laptop computers can stop thinking of the machines as office equipment and start using them as a way to keep in touch with friends and family while on the road. Almost any laptop with a modem can link up with an on-line service, like Compuserve, Prodigy or America Online, and all three have E-mail message service.  <p>Postcards are nice, if they arrive before the traveler. Phone calls are good, too. But E-mail can be better for communicating across time zones or with a child who will be asleep before a business dinner ends.</p> <p>And E-mail means sending a message for the price of two local phone calls (one from your hotel to the nearest local connection point; one from your home, for a message to be received). It can encourage children to pick up the art of letter writing.</p> <p>Compuserve and America Online have 24-hour toll-free numbers supplying local access numbers for anywhere in the country. They ask for the baud rate (the speed at which the laptop operates) and the phone number from which the call will be made. Compuserve is at (800) 848-8199. (You can download a national directory before leaving home by typing &quot;go phones.&quot;) America Online is at (800) 473-7983, for Sprintnet, one of two services providing access to America Online, or (800) 336-0149, for Tymnet, the other one. (Some Tymnet nodes don&#39;t work on America Online at speeds of more than 2,400 baud.)</p> <p>Prodigy is simpler: click on the set-up button, and click again to dial the toll-free number, (800) 776-3449, which gives local access numbers.</p> <p>Brian Ek, a spokesman for Prodigy, said his service was particularly popular with the Washington Redskins football team. Half the players travel with laptops to keep track of their statistics, he added. They often type out messages while they fly and use E-mail when they land.</p> <p>Any service will do, but they have various strengths. Compuserve boasts it is available by local phone call in Europe and Asia. America Online allows an account holder to have several different screen names, so each member of a household can receive individually addressed mail.</p> <p>Following are tips for using a laptop on the road:</p> <p>If the phone in your hotel room is not joined to the wire with a modular connector (the kind the modem is designed to plug into), try the connection at the jack on the wall. If the wire just disappears into a hole in a metal plate, unscrew the plate and look inside; you will almost always find a modular connector inside.</p> <p>When entering the phone number in your software, remember to begin with a &quot;9&quot; to get an outside line.</p> <p>E-mail is not as secure as regular mail. It is certainly secure enough to trust with a message to help an 11-year-old with her homework or to threaten an 8-year-old if he doesn&#39;t practice the piano. But think twice before sending sensitive information.</p>
754260>New Catalytic Process Would Let Cars Eat Ozone You&#39;re in the heart of Los Angeles on a miserably smoggy day and decide to do your bit to clean up the air. So you take a drive on the freeway. Outlandish as it may seem, the latest idea in the battle to chip away at air pollution is to turn cars into roving air purifiers, devouring any smog that crosses their path.  <p>This is no visionary fantasy; it is taken dead-seriously by a variety of experts. &quot;It&#39;s not a wacky idea,&quot; said John H. Seinfeld, chairman of the division of engineering and applied sciences at the California Institute of Technology, in Pasadena. &quot;It&#39;s something worth looking into.&quot;</p> <p>And the markets, which try mightily to resist falling for daydreams, are quite taken with the idea as well. Shares of the Engelhard Corporation -- the developer of the idea -- shot up 31 percent yesterday, rising $9.125, to $38.50, after the company announced its technology on Tuesday. Futures prices for platinum, an integral component of the process, hit a four-and-a-half-year high on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rising $10.60 an ounce for July delivery, to $464.10, its highest price since Sept. 7, 1990.  [ Page D17. ]</p> <p>So what&#39;s up? Engelhard, an Iselin, N.J., company that in the mid-1970&#39;s developed catalytic converters for cars, has now developed a catalyst that would reduce pollution in a whole new way.</p> <p>The company has specialized for years in automotive catalysts, the under-car canisters that scrub the exhaust, converting carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides into harmless carbon dioxide and water. Hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, if emitted freely, can be cooked by the summer sun into ground-level ozone, or smog -- poisonous molecules consisting of three oxygen atoms.</p> <p>Now Engelhard is trying to persuade Federal regulators and car makers to add a new catalyst, one that breaks ozone down into a molecule of two oxygen atoms, which is what we breathe. The catalyst works at summer temperatures or on a warm surface; the idea is to paint automobile radiators and air-conditioner compressors with the catalyst so that a car purifies the air that runs under its hood.</p> <p>&quot;In Los Angeles they drive 266 million miles a day,&quot; said William Rosenberg, a former assistant administrator for air at the Environmental Protection Agency whose air-pollution consulting company is working with Engelhard. &quot;That&#39;s a lot of air you could process.&quot;</p> <p>Outside experts agree that the idea has promise. &quot;It presents us with a great opportunity, beyond zero-emission vehicles,&quot; said Mary D. Nichols, the E.P.A.&#39;s assistant administrator for air and radiation, referring to the electric cars soon to be mandated in California. &quot;We can move into negative-emission vehicles.&quot; But she said more work was needed to determine costs.</p> <p>The idea is in its early stages. At $500 to $1,000 a car, Engelhard said, it would be cheaper than other air-cleaning schemes, especially in California, which in its effort to reduce polluting emissions has clamped down on everything from factories to house paint and deodorant.</p> <p>Engelhard said that the fundamental difference between this and other systems was that the car did not purify its own exhaust; instead it destroyed a pollutant in the atmosphere, using nothing but the catalyst and waste radiator heat. It also eats carbon monoxide, a toxic gas produced by incomplete combustion, converting it into carbon dioxide.</p> <p>While ozone could be anywhere, carbon monoxide is concentrated on roads. The Engelhard system could thus make tailgating socially useful.</p> <p>Since ozone is so diffuse -- it is measured in parts per billion -- it is hard to find before it can be destroyed. Engelhard&#39;s idea is to piggyback on existing equipment that moves huge volumes of air already.</p> <p>Ms. Nichols of the E.P.A. said it might be possible to paint the catalyst onto the radiators of existing cars, rather than apply it only as new cars are built. To work best, though, it would require some changes in cars.</p> <p>Radiators and compressors come into contact with huge volumes of air when a car is moving or a fan is running. Dr. Terry Poles, an Engelhard engineer, said the best method would be to reprogram a car&#39;s fan to run in peak ozone periods, even if the car was parked.</p> <p>Ms. Nichols said home and office air conditioners could be coated, too. But the Federal Government might find it easier to force the change on car makers.</p> <p>The Federal limit for ozone is 120 parts per billion, but in Los Angeles it can hit 200. Violations elsewhere are less severe and less frequent.</p> <p>According to an Engelhard-commissioned study by Science Applications International, in Los Angeles at peak ozone hours about 10 percent of the area&#39;s cars are on the road. If all those had the catalyst, the ozone peak would decline by 1.3 parts per billion; if parked cars worked at it too, the ozone peak would decline by 4.5 parts per billion.</p> <p>That pollution reduction is larger than what California would gain from switching to reformulated gasoline, Engelhard said, and compares favorably in cost with other pollution-control methods.</p> <p>The national standard for carbon monoxide is 9 parts per million, but some cities record concentrations around 12 parts. Engelhard said its process could knock off 1 or 1.5 parts per million.</p> <p>The key to the system is the catalyst, a material that encourages a chemical reaction. But in contrast to the catalysts Engelhard already supplies for cars, this one works at a very low temperature.</p> <p>Dr. Poles said the new catalyst would be &quot;easily accepted by the public,&quot; since it would hardly be noticed. By contrast, some motorists complain bitterly about reformulated gasoline, and car makers have their doubts that electric cars, another clean-air strategy, will win market approval.</p> <p>Engelhard said that it had discussed the idea with only one domestic car maker and that the manufacturer was not ready to say whether it supported the idea.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Ford Motor Company said yesterday that the company did not have enough information on the process to comment.</p>
1319006>Citing Safety Gaps, U.S. Limits Links to Korean Air Carriers The Federal Aviation Administration told South Korea today that its regulation of aviation safety fell short of international standards, and that as a result, Korean carriers flying to the United States would not be allowed to expand their service, use American partners or use airplanes other than those they are now flying. The action, which set off fierce protests in Seoul, was taken 14 months after international auditors first found that the Korean Civil Aviation Bureau had vast gaps in regulations and no training program for  inspectors.  <p>Americans involved in the case said the ruling was made after much consultation within the Bush administration and with Korean officials, and the statement by the F.A.A. this afternoon contained unusually conciliatory language, citing the &#39;&#39;progressive leadership&#39;&#39; of the Korean director of civil aviation and the minister of transportation and construction. But even before the announcement in Washington, the transportation minister, O Chang Sop, complained to reporters in Seoul that the agency had violated a pledge to discuss its ruling with the Koreans beforehand. An aide to Mr. Oh quoted him as telling an American diplomat who delivered the news, &#39;&#39;We think this is unfair.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The finance minister, Chin Nyom, told a Korean radio station that he would file a complaint with the F.A.A. Prime Minister Yi Han Tong held an emergency meeting on the decision. The agency is sending an associate administrator, Thomas E. McSweeney, to Seoul on Monday to work with his Korean counterparts.</p> <p>In the last two years the United States has put similar restrictions on Greece, Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas, El Salvador and Panama, but none of those countries have strategic relationships with this country as important as South Korea&#39;s.</p> <p>Korean officials said the downgrading hurt national prestige and was a commercial blow as well.  Korean Air Lines, the larger of the two carriers that flies to this country from Korea, had a partnership with Delta Airlines and Air France that was suspended in 1999. The other,  Asiana, has had a partnership with American Airlines since July 1998. A spokesman at American, Mark Slitt, said American would immediately begin recalling tickets sold for travel on Asiana and help passengers get new tickets on Asiana.</p> <p>Mr. Slitt pointed out that the F.A.A. assessment was of a Korean government agency, not of any particular airline.</p> <p>The agency provided no details on how the Korean government had fallen short. A copy of the assessment by the International Civil Aviation Organization last year, made available by a person who favored the step taken today, said that there was no formal training program for the Korean agency&#39;s personnel who inspect airplanes for safety and airworthiness, hazardous goods and other hazards, and that the government did not require proficiency checks for co-pilots or set training standards for cabin crew.</p>
535940>No title In a deal that would create one of the largest electric utilities in the United States, the Entergy Corporation of New Orleans yesterday announced plans to buy Texas-based Gulf States Utilities for $2.3 billion in cash and stock. The combined entity would serve 2.3 million customers in an area of 112,000 square miles. Entergy operates in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and Gulf States, which has been struggling for six years with a costly nuclear plant and stiff competition from independent generators, serves Texas and Louisiana.  <p>Under an agreement unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, Entergy would pay $20 a share for Gulf States stock, either in cash or in its own shares at the option of shareholders.</p> <p>Gulf States shares gained $1.25 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, closing at $15.75. The stock was as low as $8.50 last year.</p> <p>&quot;If they were to stay independent, this would not be a $16 stock,&quot; said Barry M. Abramson of Prudential Securities. Entergy closed at $27 a share, down 12.5 cents, on the Big Board. Lull in Utility Mergers</p> <p>The deal was announced after a long lull in utility mergers, created in part by the rejection by California regulators a year ago of a merger between Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric.</p> <p>In addition, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates interstate power contracts, has destroyed one traditional goal of mergers: the creation of huge proprietary transmission networks. The commission has told utilities that it will not approve their mergers unless they open their transmission systems to other companies.</p> <p>But some analysts -- and, evidently, some utility executives -- still believe that mergers can bring substantial economies. Executives of Entergy (which used to be known as Middle South Utilities) and of Gulf States told Wall Street analysts yesterday that their combination would save $600 million in fuel costs over 10 years.</p> <p>They also suggested that because Gulf States operates only one nuclear plant, combining its operation with Entergy&#39;s four would allow lower-cost operation through better use of personnel.</p> <p>&quot;We&#39;re still in a business that has economics of scale,&quot; Edwin Lupberger, chairman and chief executive of Entergy, said in a telephone interview. &quot;The bigger you are, the better you can do, if you manage it right.&quot;  Are They the Answer?</p> <p>Some utility experts are skeptical that opening transmission systems, as was done in the Pacificorp and Utah Power and Light merger in early 1989, or achieving economies of scale, as is claimed for all mergers, have made much difference.</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s hard to say that the world is a better place, or that the customers of Utah or California are better off because a single company controls such a huge territory,&quot; said Leon Lowry, an electric utility expert with Environmental Action, a Washington-based advocacy group.</p> <p>Utilities generally contend that combined operation allows for &quot;economic dispatch&quot; of generating stations, so that as demand for power rises and falls, generating stations are started up and turned off in order of their costs to run. Smaller utilities generally overcome this problem by buying and selling power among themselves.</p> <p>But Mr. Lupberger said: &quot;There&#39;s a real benefit to having a jointly owned operation. Obviously, you can do a lot of things with your cousins or your neighbors, and so forth, but you can be more effective with your immediate family.&quot;</p> <p>The agreement announced yesterday comes as the smaller partner, Gulf States, emerges from a long troubled stretch. The company cut stock dividends in 1986 and 1987 and teetered near bankruptcy because it finished the River Bend nuclear plant, in St. Francisville, La., far over budget in 1986 just as a severe regional recession was beginning. The recession cut the demand for power, and the company also lost sales to independent generators.</p> <p>Recently, however, it paid off back dividends in preferred stock, which it must do if it is to resume common dividends.</p> <p>Mr. Lupberger said that Entergy had held on to big industrial customers by offering special deals, and that Gulf States had done the same. The combined entity would do more, he said. Approvals Are Needed</p> <p>The utilities must win regulatory approval for their merger from the public service commissions of Texas and Louisiana; the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates Entergy as a multistate utility holding company; the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates bulk interstate power sales, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, because both utilities run reactors.</p> <p>The utilities said they thought the deal could close in 12 to 18 months but Mr. Abramson of Prudential and others said two years was more likely.</p> <p>The deliberation may be particularly complex in Louisiana. According to Paul Zimmering, a New Orleans lawyer who in the past has been hired by the state&#39;s Public Service Commission to analyze regulatory decisions, about half the state&#39;s residential customers are served by Gulf States, and 40 percent by Entergy. He said the commission would probably conclude that the merger was favorable for both groups of customers.</p> <p>Another issue for the Louisiana commission, he said, was that if the merger was consummated, some of its regulatory power would, in effect, be transferred to the Federal Energy Regulatory commission, which regulates the bulk power-sales contracts used by big utilities like Entergy to sell power to their operating subsidiaries.</p> <p>He added, &quot;You&#39;ve got an awful lot of jurisdictions with an interest here.&quot;</p> <p>Correction:  June 10, 1992, Wednesday</p> <p>Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about the proposed merger of Entergy and Gulf States Utilities misstated the position of Paul Zimmering, a lawyer. He said that before Louisiana&#39;s Public Service Commission could approve the merger, it would probably have to conclude that the deal would benefit customers of both companies; he did not say the commission would conclude that the merger would benefit the customers.</p>
275451>NORTHEAST STATES MOVE TO RESTRICT POLLUTION BY CARS Officials of eight Northeastern states have agreed to adopt strict emission controls on automobiles and light trucks in a long-term, multibillion-dollar effort to reduce air pollution.  <p>The action, which would take effect beginning with 1993 model year, would bring emission laws in New York, New Jersey and New England into line with those in California, which are significantly stricter than the Federal standards that apply everywhere else.</p> <p>Announcing the move yesterday, environmental officials from the eight states described the effort as the biggest assault on air pollution since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1977. But they added that the effort would remove only a third to half the pollutants needed to bring the region as a whole into compliance with Federal limits on smog and carbon monoxide.</p> <p>The rules would apply to new vehicles and would take effect gradually, starting with 40 percent of the 1993 models. The rules set lower emissions per mile for several pollutants and require that the anti-pollution equipment be designed to last 100,000 miles, as against the current standard of 50,000 miles. Auto Makers Disappointed</p> <p>Officials said it was unlikely that the rules would require any extra equipment on new cars, but added that the modifications and testing requirements would add about $150 to the cost of a new car.</p> <p>Officials in California said the rules there had not hampered cars&#39; performance. At the Ford Motor Company in Detroit, Kelly M. Brown, executive engineer for fuel economy and emissions controls, said, &#39;&#39;Something has got to give somewhere,&#39;&#39; and added that sticker price and fuel economy were the likely casualties.</p> <p>Auto makers said they were disappointed by the Northeastern states&#39; move and would oppose it. &#39;&#39;If auto manufacturers are forced to respond to a patchwork of different emissions standards throughout the nation,&#39;&#39; General Motors said in a statement, &#39;&#39;production, distribution and sales of vehicles will become increasingly complex and costly to consumers.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Environmental officials from Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York said they could impose the most important of the new rules by administrative regulation, but they added that they were seeking or would probably seek approval from their Legislatures. In New Hampshire and Rhode Island, officials said legislative approval would be needed, and in Connecticut all administrative regulations are subject to veto by a legislative committee. An official in Vermont said he did not know whether legislative approval would be needed there.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I would be very surprised to see any significant opposition when this goes to the Legislature,&#39;&#39; said Robert W. Varney, the Commissioner of Environmental Services in New Hampshire. &#39;&#39;The ozone levels and air pollution in general are a major concern in the Northeast.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The action by the Northeastern states comes as Congress considers amendments to the Clean Air Act, including a program proposed by President Bush that would be nearly as strict as the California rules in some ways.</p> <p>But officials of the eight states, who have been discussing this change for a year, say the Bush Administration proposal is inadequate because its emission limits are not as strict as California&#39;s and because it would not require the pollution control equipment to be as durable.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;What we are saying is that if Washington refuses to, we will do what we must to protect the health of our people,&#39;&#39; said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, &#39;&#39;But it&#39;s still true it would be better for the nation if Washington would recognize its special responsibility.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But in Washington, Martha Casey, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency, said: &#39;&#39;What these states are calling for is essentially contained in the President&#39;s clean-air proposal. We believe emissions reductions are needed not only in the Northeast but nationwide; therefore we encourage quick Congressional action on the President&#39;s proposal.&#39;&#39; Pollution From Midwest</p> <p>The dispute between the Northeastern states and the Administration is not limited to what standards should prevail in the Northeast. Officials in New York, New Jersey and New England have argued for years that about 40 percent of their pollution is blown in on the wind, largely from the Midwest, and that the E.P.A. should do more to cut emissions from cars, factories and power plants there.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Even if we stopped economic activity in New York City, we would not achieve clean air,&#39;&#39; said Thomas C. Jorling, New York State&#39;s Commissioner of Environmental Conservation.</p> <p>The rules proposed for the Northeastern states would follow exactly California&#39;s emission control regulations. Under the Clean Air Act of 1977, only California has the right to set its own standards for cars and light trucks. Other states were given the option of adopting California&#39;s system or following the national one.</p> <p>The California rules set lower emissions standards for hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen than the Federal Government does, and require that the anti-pollution devices be designed to function for a longer period: 100,000 miles for the pre-production models tested by the state government, and 75,000 miles for the cars in customers&#39; hands.</p> <p>The Federal standard is 50,000 miles. Officials say the higher mileage standard is important because most pollution comes from old cars. Inspections Are Required</p> <p>California also requires testing of the cars as they come off the assembly line and after several years of service, and the state can order recalls of whole classes of vehicles if their emission rates rise as they age.</p> <p>The additional cost in California is $100 a car, which is listed on the price sticker. Most of that pays for certification testing by the state.</p> <p>Of the 10.5 million new cars registered in this country in 1988, 1.9 million, or 18.5 percent, were in the eight Northeastern states. California had another 1.2 million, or 11.5 percent. No state has followed California&#39;s example until now, and many say the auto makers would not go to the trouble to meet the standards for a small market.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;ve blown that argument out of the water,&#39;&#39; said John De Villars, the Secretary of the Environment in Massachusetts. He said other states with air problems are likely to follow the Northeast&#39;s lead. Emissions and Smog</p> <p>Auto makers said the California standards do not focus on the pollutants most important to the Northeast. The California standard sets lower limits on hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen, which produce ground-level ozone, or smog, when baked in the sun. But under certain circumstances, if there is a great deal of nitrogen oxide, the gas can inhibit the formation of smog. &#39;&#39;Some cities would generate ozone faster under this proposal,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Brown, the Ford engineer. &#39;&#39;At best, they would break even.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But officials in the Northeast say that while this may be true in the cities, it is not the case in rural areas. In addition, said Michael Bradley, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, nitrogen oxide contributes to acid rain.</p> <p>Mr. Bradley&#39;s group, made up of environmental officials from the eight states, organized the yearlong effort, The environmental commissioners say the eight states have a history of successful cooperation; two years ago the commissioners jointly resolved to impose strict controls on the content of gasoline sold within their borders in order to cut down smog. Despite opposition by the oil industry and resistance from the Environmental Protection Agency, those regulations took effect throughout the region this spring.</p> <p>The reductions proposed for the Northeast would be slow, gaining ground only as old cars are replaced by new ones. But a study done for Mr. Bradley&#39;s organization by Sierra Research of Sacramento, Calif., predicted that by 2010, carbon monoxide levels would be 39 percent lower, nitrogen oxides 27 percent lower and hydrocarbons 16 percent lower than they would be if the current Federal standard remained in effect. $600 Per Ton of Pollutants With 1.9 million cars sold last year in the eight-state area, the total cost to consumers would run into hundreds of millions of dollars each year. But Mr. Bradley and others said that for nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, the cost would be about $600 per ton removed. The eight states have forced factories to reduce emissions of those pollutants at costs of up to $5,000 per ton.</p> <p>In all American cars, the three pollutants can be controlled by reactions in the catalytic converter. All cars use a sensor in the tailpipe to measure the oxygen content of the exhaust. Working through a computer chip, the sensor then sends messages back to the fuel injection system (which has replaced the carburetor in most new cars) to vary the fuel-air mixture and improve combustion.</p> <p>In California, the microchip is programmed slightly differently, to cut pollution. In addition, the gears in some cars sold in California are designed so the engine will not work as hard.</p>
780223>Giving the Refrigerator More Brainpower Pity the refrigerator, the biggest appliance in the house but also the dumbest. These days, the dinkiest microwave oven is run by a computer chip, as is the conventional oven, the dishwasher, the clothes washer and the dryer. Even the puny thermostat and doorbell can outclass the refrigerator in brainpower. But refrigerators are finally joining the information age. The Whirlpool Corporation and Amana Refrigeration Inc. are making high-end refrigerators equipped with microprocessors that keep track of the amount of frost forming on the evaporator coils, which are the metal parts that cool the boxes, giving the machines the brains to know when they should defrost.  <p>For the 140 million older refrigerators in the United States, a Long Island company has developed a matchbook-size computerized timer to replace the existing mechanical one. This timer is even smarter than the chips going into the new refrigerators because it knows what time of day to do the job.</p> <p>Aside from central air-conditioners or electric heaters, refrigerators are the largest users of electricity in a house. And older ones are the least efficient.</p> <p>A self-defrosting refrigerator works this way: A mechanical system keeps track of how long the compressor runs, and every few hours of use, the system heats up the coil, driving off the frost. But this, in turn, heats up the refrigerator. When the defrost cycle is over, the compressor must work harder to cool the refrigerator again.</p> <p>Whether it is a humid day in summer, when the frost builds quickly, or a dry day in winter, when frost takes longer to form, the mechanical system for most refrigerators goes about its task, oblivious to the outside world.</p> <p>But a top-of-the-line refrigerator, which generally costs $1,500 to $2,000, has an &quot;adaptive defroster&quot; that is run by a chip. It, too, heats up the coil, but the electronic brain tucked into the mechanical muscle of the machine keeps track of how long it takes to reach the necessary warm temperature, which is a measure of how much frost there is.</p> <p>&quot;If it&#39;s short, the microchip realizes there wasn&#39;t much frost on the coil -- &#39;I can wait longer,&#39; &quot; said Brian M. Midlang, manager of the electronic control section at Amana, which is a subsidiary of the Raytheon Company. Conversely, if the coil took a long time to heat, the brain concludes that there was too much ice -- a condition that raises energy use -- and it orders the next defrosting at a shorter interval.</p> <p>That is the best that refrigerators now on the market can do. But engineers like Daniel R. Stettin are going further, shifting the defrosting to the nighttime.</p> <p>Mr. Stettin, who is president of Wire Graphics Inc. of Farmingdale, L.I., recently applied for a patent on a computerized timer that can replace the mechanical ones in existing refrigerators.</p> <p>The microprocessor can tell when it is night by keeping track of how hard the compressor is working. The compressor runs more in the daytime, when the door keeps opening and the temperature is generally higher.</p> <p>At night, the compressor does not have to work as hard to cool down the refrigerator after the defrosting is over, so the refrigerator uses less power. Also, temperature fluctuations are reduced, which is better for the food stored inside.</p> <p>Utilities, of course, would prefer nighttime defrosting because it would shift the power demand to a time when there is less power demand. Mr. Stettin&#39;s development of his timer was paid for in part by a grant from the Long Island Lighting Company, which has the highest electricity rates in the country. By Mr. Stettin&#39;s calculation, a user of a refrigerator on Long Island could save $25 to $30 a year by replacing a mechanical timer with a &quot;smart&quot; one.</p> <p>But it takes longer to get new technology into a refrigerator than into other appliances, because of the low turnover. Many refrigerators last more than 15 years, which means that millions of them will continue to defrost dumbly for years. That is, unless a manufacturer deems Mr. Stettin&#39;s computerized timer commercially viable, perhaps with incentives from a utility company eager to move some of its electric load to an off-peak period.</p>
247697>Agency Bars Paying Whistle-Blowers for Silence An electrical foreman at a Texas nuclear plant was paid by his former employers in exchange for a promise not to tell Federal officials about what he says were safety problems there, even if subpoenaed.  <p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which did not intervene when it first learned of the agreement, has now told reactor operators that such settlements are forbidden.</p> <p>The man, Joseph J. Macktal Jr. of Stephenville, Tex., said he lost his job in January 1986 after complaining about various electrical problems at the Comanche Peak plant in Glenrose, Tex. A spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said yesterday that Mr. Macktal&#39;s allegations had been fully explored at the time.</p> <p>Mr. Macktal brought a complaint before the Department of Labor, because dismissing &#39;&#39;whistle-blowers&#39;&#39; is illegal under the Atomic Energy Act. In January 1987 he signed a settlement with his former employer, the construction company Brown &amp; Root, in which he dropped the complaint and agreed not to &#39;&#39;voluntarily appear as a witness or a party&#39;&#39; in any proceeding against any company involved in Comanche Peak.</p> <p>The settlement also provided that if he was &#39;&#39;served with compulsory process seeking to compel his appearance,&#39;&#39; he would &#39;&#39;take all reasonable steps, including such reasonable steps as may be suggested by the representatives of Brown &amp; Root, to resist.&#39;&#39; He says the agreement included a payment of $15,000 for him and $20,000 for his lawyers.</p> <p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission knew about this settlement when it voted unanimously in December to allow licensing to proceed for the Comanche Peak plant. It said then that there was nothing illegal in the agreement, but reversed itself late last month when a Senate subcommittee began an investigation. John Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who heads a nuclear subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works, called the nuclear commission&#39;s actions &#39;&#39;an incredibly weak response to an issue of major regulatory significance.&#39;&#39; He added that the commission showed an &#39;&#39;astonishing inability to make decisions which send clear signals.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Macktal said that he was pressured into the agreement by his lawyers, who believed he could not pay their fee. He was represented by Billie Garde, of the anti-nuclear Government Accountability Project, who was instrumental in forcing the abandonment of the Zimmer reactor in Ohio because of safety problems, and Anthony T. Roisman, of Trial Lawyers for Public Justice. Mr. Roisman, now with a private firm in Washington, was said by his secretary yesterday to be vacationing in France and unreachable; Ms. Garde&#39;s office in Appleton, Wis., said that she was in Washington and could not be reached. Silence on the Bargaining Table</p> <p>A spokesman for Brown &amp; Root, Joe Stevens, said yesterday that the company was trying only to end litigation in the issues Mr. Macktal raised.</p> <p>Mr. Macktal said that after he was dismissed, he learned that wiring of a type common in the plant had failed in aircraft and other uses in which it was exposed to harsh conditions of the kind it might face at Comanche Peak. But he said the agreement barred him from telling the commission about it.</p> <p>The panel ruled in December that the agreement was legal because it did not bar Mr. Macktal from bringing safety concerns &#39;&#39;directly to the N.R.C.,&#39;&#39; outside the context of a proceeding. But Mr. Macktal&#39;s new attorney, Stephen M. Kohn, argued that under Federal law, a &#39;&#39;proceeding&#39;&#39; is anything that could lead to a ruling by a Federal agency.</p> <p>In a motion before the Department of Labor, Mr. Kohn said, &#39;&#39;After a singificant period of economic deprivation, the prospect of prolonged and costly litigation and the disruption of routine life, individual whistle-blowers often see no alternative but settlement on almost any terms. If an employer is allowed to place &#39;silence&#39; on the bargaining table, the result is predictable; it is only a matter of time until an employee succumbs.&#39;&#39;</p>
423920>In Unusual Move, E.P.A. Tries to Fine Energy Dept. Over Cleanup In a highly unusual inter-agency fight, a frustrated Environmental Protection Agency is seeking to impose a fine of nearly $300,000 on the Department of Energy because it has repeatedly missed deadlines that it had agreed to for cleaning up a nuclear weapons plant. But the department is arguing that it should not have to pay, in part because it has no budget for fines. As a general principle, Federal agencies do not fine one another. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t make sense,&quot; said David B. Ryan, a spokesman for the environmental agency in Washington. &quot;You would be transferring funds that go right back into the Treasury.&quot;  <p>But the Environmental Protection Agency and state regulators are increasingly frustrated by the Department of Energy. For years the Energy Department asserted it was not subject to outside regulation; then it said it was, but took many months to negotiate agreements for complying with those regulations. Now the environmental agency and state regulators are discovering that the agreements do not guarantee a cleanup.</p> <p>The Energy Department and the environmental agency signed an agreement last June on the cleanup at the weapons plant, the Feed Materials Production Center, in Fernald, Ohio, near Cincinnati. The agreement set deadlines and called for fines for noncompliance. The Energy Department has repeatedly missed the deadlines, and the fines are increasing by $20,000 a week. The Environmental Protection Agency is pressing the case to emphasize that it is serious about enforcing the agreement.  &#39;We&#39;re Waiting for Them&#39;</p> <p>&quot;We&#39;re waiting for them to come in with some holistic approach to solving their problems, some attitude and management change,&quot; said Catherine A. McCord, the environmental agency&#39;s project manager for Fernald.</p> <p>The environmental agency has collected only one fine against another Federal agency, said Mary Mears, a spokeswoman at the Washington headquarters. That fine, for $10,000, was imposed about a year ago against the Department of Defense for failing to follow a schedule for cleaning up the Letterkenny Arms Depot in Chambersburg, Pa., she said.</p> <p>Leo P. Duffy, the top environmental official in the Energy Department, is to meet with top regional officials of the Environmental Protection Agency at their Chicago office this afternoon to discuss the fines. Ms. McCord, the environmental agency&#39;s project manager for Fernald, said that she expected her agency to stick to its guns, and that it did not appear that Mr. Duffy was &quot;going to come in here with cash in hand.&quot;</p> <p>If no agreement is reached, the dispute will eventually be decided by the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s administrator, William K. Reilly, in Washington, who has final say under the agreement.</p> <p>The environmental agency says that the Energy Department has acknowledged filing inadequate reports on its cleanup plans. A spokesman for the Energy Department, Fred C. Lash, said he was not familiar with the details in the Fernald case, but that in general his department has had trouble filing studies required by the agreement.  &#39;Should Be a Better Way&#39;</p> <p>But Mr. Lash said that the department considered the fines &quot;rather ridiculous.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;When we get $200,000 taken out of our pockets, it comes out of what Congress has given us for cleanup,&quot; he said. &quot;There should be a better way than fining,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But he said he did not know of an alternative.</p> <p>If paid, the money would go into a fund maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency to pay for cleaning up toxic waste across the nation.</p> <p>The Energy Department agreed about two years ago to a court-supervised settlement of more than $70 million with landowners in the Fernald area but failed to make the payments on the schedule to which it agreed. The landowners threatened to attach the assets of a contractor with the department, but were eventually paid. Attitude Draws Complaints</p> <p>The department is also under fire from the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Washington for recently having unilaterally postponed a deadline it had agreed on with them for building a plant to solidify highly radioactive wastes at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. The wastes, which may be explosive, are currently in tanks that are leaking and decaying.</p> <p>Shira Flax, a lobbyist with the Sierra Club and an expert on the nuclear weapons production plants, said of the Energy Department, &quot;They don&#39;t understand that the Environmental Protection Agency and the states are not simply co-signers, they are regulators.&quot; She added, &quot;They&#39;re revealing an attitude that says, &#39;No matter, agreements aside, we will do only what we want to do.&#39; &quot;</p> <p>At Fernald, Ms. McCord of the environmental agency said, the Energy Department was to dig wells on neighboring properties to determine where underground water had been contaminated by uranium from the plant. She said pollution was spreading underground in a &quot;plume&quot; that resembled a cloud. &quot;We&#39;ve got a groundwater plume a mile and a half from the Fernald property, and we still have not characterized the magnitude of the plume,&quot; she said. But the Energy Department delayed nearly two months beyond the deadline for having lawyers at the Justice Department to begin the process of gaining access to the property.</p> <p>While those papers were eventually filed, the Environmental Protection Agency is still waiting for a report on radioactive residues in silos on the Fernald property that are described as the largest single sources of radon in this country. Despite warnings, the department has repeatedly failed to sample what is in the silos, and the surrounding soil and water, the agency says.</p>
163608>L.I. Water Shows Radioactive Trace Radioactive material from the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island has entered the drinking water of nearby homes, though not at dangerous levels, according to a draft report by the United States Department of Energy.  <p>Investigators have also found toxic chemicals in the water, though laboratory officials assert that their center is not the source, according to the study. Suffolk County officials, however, believe that it is.</p> <p>In the wells outside the 5,300-acre laboratory site at Upton, the radioactive and chemical contamination levels are still within permissible limits for drinking water, according to the study, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. But many wells inside the site are contaminated above those levels, and a &#39;&#39;plume&#39;&#39; of badly contaminated water extends half a mile and &#39;&#39;is migrating in a southerly direction,&#39;&#39; the study found. Deficiencies in Monitoring</p> <p>The radioactive material was said to be tritium, a byproduct from a nuclear reactor. The chemicals include chloroform and trichloroethylene, known as TCE, a solvent that researchers have said may cause cancer.</p> <p>In addition, the study reported, &#39;&#39;the ground-water monitoring program has a number of deficiencies which make it difficult to characterize the nature and extent of ground-water contamination both on-site and off-site.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The problems range from too few monitoring wells to wells identified with bicycle flags with a number written on them. The ink weathered and became illegible, the department found.</p> <p>Suffolk County has also identified problems at the laboratory.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They were very proud of their waste-treatment plant until we got a look at it,&#39;&#39; said Gregory J. Blass, a county legislator whose district includes the plant. &#39;&#39;It turned out more than half of their facilities were not connected to it.&#39;&#39; Aeration Used to Clean Water</p> <p>According to George Proios, executive director of the Long Island Water Commission and a member of a task force formed by Mr. Blass to investigate the problem, the monitoring wells are not deep enough to give an accurate picture of the pollution.</p> <p>The laboratory&#39;s director, Dr. Nicholas P. Samios, said the center had the chemical problem under control, having removed 90 to 95 percent of the chemicals by pumping the water out of the ground and aerating it.</p> <p>The tritium, he said, is below dangerous levels and is naturally disappearing, because it has a half-life of less than 13 years, meaning that as it gives off its radiation, it diminishes by half in that period.</p> <p>In addition, he said, more wells have been drilled and other problems have been addressed since the Department of Energy inspection, which was in the spring of 1987. The study draft is dated Jan. 18, 1988; a final version has not yet been issued.</p> <p>According to Dr. Samios, most of the pollution is the result of dumping that has been discontinued at the 41-year-old laboratory. He added that the contamination was not a threat to health and that the laboratory was doing everything possible to control the problem.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We have 3,000 employees of this lab who live in the neighborhood,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re certainly concerned about our own employees, and our own employees are concerned. We try to comply with all the rules.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The study is one of a series being done by the Department of Energy of its centers around the country to determine which require cleanup most urgently. Some of the samples were taken in 1985.</p> <p>Amid growing national pressure to clean up the centers, Congress is moving to bring them under the Federal laws that cover industrial plants. At present the Department of Justice is blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from suing the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense to enforce Federal pollution laws.</p> <p>Last Thursday a subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce approved five bills that would extend the environmental agency&#39;s jurisdiction over the Department of Energy.</p> <p>In a phone interview the chairman of the subcommittee, Representative Thomas A. Luken, Democrat of Ohio, said the department was &#39;&#39;hiding behind a shield of immunity, and it&#39;s resulted in cesspools of nuclear waste and all kinds of waste.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>While Brookhaven&#39;s waste is not as radioactive as that of many other centers, the Department of Energy draft findings note that the laboratory, which is about 60 miles east of New York City, sits atop an aquifer that provides most of the drinking water for the area and that the aquifer is &#39;&#39;extremely susceptible to contamination due to its proximity to the surface and high permeability.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The plume of contamination is moving about a foot a day, according to Gerald C. Kinne, an assistant director of the laboratory, but he said that at that rate it would take several years to spread beyond the center&#39;s boundary and that the aeration program would make the water potable by then.</p> <p>The chemicals are from a class known as volatile organic compounds. The current New York State guideline, which is being met outside the Brookhaven site, is 50 parts per billion for individual compounds, with a total of no more than 100 parts per billion. But the State Health Department is considering a standard for some of the chemicals of five parts per billion. Strontium-90 Is Found</p> <p>The radioactive contaminants include strontium-90, which is the chemical equivalent of calcium and is incorporated into human bones, where it damages the marrow.</p> <p>Tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, the basic fuel of hydrogen bombs, is produced in Brookhaven&#39;s nuclear reactor. It combines with oxygen to form a material whose chemistry mimics ordinary water. The maximum concentration considered safe in drinking water is 20,000 picocuries per liter, according to the study. A picocurie is a measure of the amount of a substance that emits radiation.</p> <p>Tritium was found on one occasion at a level of 1,060 picocuries per liter at a school in Manorville, no longer in use, and at 1,340 picocuries at a Long Island Lighting Company substation in Manorville, according to the report. One well outside the Brookhaven site was reported to contain approximately 7,000 picocuries of tritium.</p> <p>The 20,000 picocurie standard is exceeded in wells on the Brookhaven site, the study said, as is the standard for chemicals.</p>
805018>Auto Air Bags May Have Killed 8 Children, Safety Agency Says Eight children who died in car crashes in recent years may have been killed by the cars&#39; air bags, the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration said today in announcing that the agency would begin considering  next week whether there was a need to adopt a new standard of air-bag design. Under current law, automobile air bags must be designed so that an average man who is not wearing a seat belt is protected in a 30-mile-an-hour crash. As a result, some bags expand so fast and forcefully that they can kill a child who is sitting in the front seat unbelted and so is thrown forward in a crash, said  the Administrator, Dr. Ricardo Martinez.  <p>The accidents involving the eight child fatalities that Dr. Martinez reported today are still under study. But the agency said it appeared that six of the children, sitting in the front seat and not properly belted, might have died from deployment of air bags. The two others were in rear-facing baby seats  that were also hit by air bags.</p> <p>Dr. Martinez, an emergency-care physician who is on leave from Emory University and formerly worked in a helicopter medical crew in California, said  the immediate solution was to have children 12 and under ride in the back seat and make sure they are always belted. Of all children killed in crashes, he said, 72 percent were not wearing seat belts.</p> <p>In contrast with the eight possible cases of air-bag-caused fatalities, the agency credits the bags with having saved more than 900 lives since they were widely introduced in the late 1980&#39;s. And the National Safety Council says air bags, used alone, reduce moderate-to-critical injuries in traffic accidents by 42 percent. Used with seat belts, the council says, they reduce such injuries by 68 percent.</p> <p>&quot;The analogy here, to me, is the medication insulin,&quot; Dr. Martinez said. &quot;No  one would say insulin should be removed from the marketplace, but it kills people every year.&quot;</p> <p>In any case, design changes could reduce the risks. Pam Kueber, a spokeswoman for the Ford Motor Company, said the bags now in use were developed at a time when few people wore seat belts. Now nearly two-thirds do, and one option would  be to alter the standard so that a bag would be required to protect a belted adult rather than an unbelted one. Such a bag would not have to open so forcefully, Ms. Kueber said.</p> <p>Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said one solution was a &quot;smart bag&quot; that would know the speed at which a crash occurred and whether the occupant was belted, and would modify its performance accordingly. And if the passenger seat was occupied by a rear-facing baby seat,  as was the case in two of the eight fatalities cited today, the bag would not open.</p> <p>Ford, in fact, now puts a switch in its vehicles that have only one seat, like pickups, so that parents who install a rear-facing baby seat can disable the bag.</p> <p>Mr. Ditlow said Honda already made a safer bag, one that opens up first toward the windshield and only then toward the passenger. That is better because the bag moves fastest in the early stage of its expansion -- up to 100 miles an  hour, Mr. Ditlow said -- and has completed two-thirds of that expansion by the time it begins moving back toward the passenger.</p>
1590826>Bloc of Lockerbie Families Urges End to Libya Penalties The families of some passengers killed 15 years ago when a Libyan agent bombed a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, are coming here Thursday to lobby for lifting the remaining sanctions against Libya. The families of the 270 victims were divided over even negotiating with Libya, but their divisions deepened strongly last summer, when Libya agreed to pay $10 million for each of the 270 victims if all sanctions against it were lifted. At the time, some relatives said the arrangement seemed like a bribe.  <p>Most families accepted a first payment of $4 million in September, when the United Nations ended its sanctions. But the deal for the remaining $6 million -- $4 million for the end of some economic sanctions and $2 million when the United States took Libya off the list of nations supporting terrorism -- expires on July 22.</p> <p>Meanwhile, recent developments have thrown more of an international shadow on Libya.</p> <p>Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, has publicly expressed regret that former President Ronald Reagan died before he could be tried as a war criminal for ordering an air-strike in 1986 against Libya that killed Colonel Qaddafi&#39;s adopted daughter and others. Also, an Arab-American arrested for currency violations has reportedly told investigators the money was provided by Libya and was to be used in a plot to assassinate the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, an American ally.</p> <p>James P. Kreindler, who represented 120 of the families in the negotiations with Libya, said relatives of 230 victims had signed a recent letter to President Bush, urging that sanctions be lifted. The letter, which he said he drafted at the request of an association of Pan Am families, was sent before the death of President Reagan and the report that Libya might be involved in a plot to kill the Saudi prince.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There is a growing sense that even with these events of the last week, sooner or later these last sanctions are going to be removed and Libya will come off the list of state sponsors of terrorism,&#39;&#39; Mr. Kreindler said in a telephone interview on Monday.</p> <p>The letter said the amount still held in escrow for the families was larger than the Libyan assets in this country that would be unblocked by the lifting of sanctions.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Thus, we are faced with the ironic circumstance in which Libya stands to gain more by the continued blocking of its assets than if its assets were timely unblocked,&#39;&#39; the letter said. &#39;&#39;Libya&#39;s enrichment in this regard, should it occur, would be made all the more difficult to understand if Libya&#39;s assets were unblocked and the other commercial sanctions were lifted within days, weeks or months after July 22.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Kreindler, in the interview on Monday, acknowledged that his firm has &#39;&#39;a lot of money riding on this,&#39;&#39; although he said his share would be &#39;&#39;substantially less&#39;&#39; than the standard contingency fee -- one-third of money recovered.</p> <p>The families coming to Washington will meet with administration officials and Congressional aides.</p> <p>A State Department official said Tuesday that the deal on damages did not involve the government and that &#39;&#39;the U.S. government is going to do what is required by law.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Libya extended its first deadline on the deal by three months, to July 22. Mr. Kreindler said Libya might be persuaded to allow another delay if action seemed imminent.</p> <p>Among the families, one of the strongest critics of lifting sanctions is Dan Cohen, of Cape May Courthouse, N.J., whose only child, Theodora, was killed when the Boeing 747 exploded on Dec. 21, 1988. The structure of the deal, Mr. Cohen said, has turned the relatives into Libyan agents. The Pan Am 103 families, he said, &#39;&#39;are now being enlisted to lobby for murderers.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Money talks,&#39;&#39; he wrote to a Congressional staff member, opposing the lobbying. &#39;&#39;Millions talks very loudly.&#39;&#39; He and his wife, Susan, will accept no Libyan money conditioned on lifting sanctions, he said.</p> <p>But Glenn P. Johnson Jr., the chairman of Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, which is the major family group growing out of the crash, said the families were asking the government to lift the sanctions before July 22 if in fact they were going to be lifted, and &#39;&#39;if they&#39;re not going to lift them, tell us why, and we&#39;ll understand that.&#39;&#39; Mr. Johnson&#39;s 21-year-old daughter, Beth Ann Johnson, who was studying psychology at Regents College in London, died on the flight.</p> <p>John Zwynenburg, chairman of the political action committee for Mr. Johnson&#39;s group, wrote in an e-mail to other families last month that major American corporations were going to benefit from the reopening of Libya, and &#39;&#39;while I&#39;m happy for the American companies, I don&#39;t want to see the families lose out.&#39;&#39;</p>
773946>Miss Liberty Shoos Blades Trying to Get Close Helen had the face that launched a thousand ships, but Lady Liberty&#39;s has launched even more helicopters; they buzz round her, two or three at a time. Now she&#39;d like some personal space. Five hundred feet, to be exact.  <p>So the Federal Government has signed an agreement under which the two helicopter companies that provide tours will keep their aircraft at least 500 feet from both Liberty Island and nearby Ellis Island.</p> <p>&quot;The noise from aircraft flying above two of the nation&#39;s most treasured historical sites has diminished the experience for many visitors,&quot; said the Secretary of Transportation, Federico F. Pena, in an announcement late Friday.</p> <p>The agreement has a rather odd genesis: an effort to protect a rather different national park, the Grand Canyon, from the buzz and roar of small aircraft following a mid-air collision there a decade ago. Now the Interior and Transportation departments in Washington are working together to set rules for flying over a variety of other national parks.</p> <p>In Lady Liberty&#39;s case, both the National Park Service and the helicopter companies say they are satisfied with the deal.</p> <p>At the city&#39;s Department of Environmental Protection, which handles noise complaints, David A. Golub, a spokesman, said he hadn&#39;t heard any complaints, but added of the helicopters: &quot;They definitely seem to come very close, and it&#39;s that pounding sound, which is very annoying.&quot;</p> <p>Along with noise, there are safety concerns, said park officials, who do not like the swarm of helicopters near their statue and their crowds. Lawrence S. Steeler, the deputy superintendent, said that on some summer days there are helicopters from dawn to dusk, sometimes too close for comfort. &quot;We&#39;re very pleased with the agreement,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Executives at the two helicopter companies that signed the agreement -- Island Helicopter and Liberty Helicopters -- maintained their choppers have never flown too close to the statue.</p> <p>Island Helicopter&#39;s brochure reads: &quot;Experience the world-famous Statue of Liberty face-to-face. The only way to fully appreciate the beauty of this historic lady is close up, from the air.&quot;</p> <p>But Peter McGann, president of Island&#39;s parent company, National Helicopter Corporation of America, called the agreement merely &quot;a re-affirmation of the flight patterns that we had anyway.&quot; He said that the agreement was not the result of any noise complaints, but &quot;an effort to work together to continue to preserve the nature of the statue and the island.&quot;</p> <p>At Liberty Helicopters, Rudy Ioppolo, the general manager, said, &quot;We always did fly 500 feet away; this just puts it on paper.&quot;</p> <p>But Harold W. Becker, of the Federal Aviation Administration&#39;s air traffic office, said that it was obvious that some helicopters were coming closer than 500 feet.</p> <p>The F.A.A. has made some other changes, he said. It has moved an east-west helicopter route from directly over the statue to an area further south, toward the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and amended its helicopter charts to show that the island is a national monument.</p>
1533801>NASA Supporters Seek National Debate on Space Goals After the shuttle Columbia disintegrated on Feb. 1, many supporters of NASA expected a renewed national debate on the goals of the space program. But nine months later, supporters of space exploration and the science program say that the subject appears to be in danger of slipping below the national horizon. &#39;&#39;There have been fits and starts of a national debate,&#39;&#39; said Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over NASA.  <p>Mr. Hollings plans to introduce a bill on Wednesday to create a national space commission to oversee NASA&#39;s progress in fixing the hardware and the &#39;&#39;broken safety culture&#39;&#39; identified in the Columbia investigation, and to help set goals.</p> <p>Senator Hollings&#39;s bill, which has six sponsors, all Democrats, joins a varied flock of measures on the House side, none likely to see major action this year.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s not commanding anywhere near the level of attention that the Challenger did,&#39;&#39; said a House staff aide who was on Capitol Hill at the time of that accident, in 1986.</p> <p>The war in Iraq helps explain the difference, the aide added, but beyond that, &#39;&#39;space is more humdrum now,&#39;&#39; even when astronauts die.</p> <p>Sean O&#39;Keefe, the NASA administrator, said in testimony last week that the Bush administration would produce a new plan for space, including a replacement vehicle for the shuttle, now more than 20 years old. He said Congress should wait until that plan is released, but he refused to predict how long that would take.</p> <p>The leisurely pace contrasts with the push by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board to complete its work over the summer so members of Congress could digest the report during their recess and be ready for a vigorous debate when they returned.</p> <p>The most prominent feature of the debate so far has been a skirmish between NASA and the chairman of the House Science Committee and the ranking Democrat on the panel. The two lawmakers, Representatives Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York, and Ralph M. Hall, Democrat of Texas, suggested that NASA hold off on development of an orbital space plane, a crew-transport vehicle that could replace the shuttle, until an &#39;&#39;overall vision for the human spaceflight program&#39;&#39; emerges.</p> <p>Mr. Boehlert said at a hearing on Oct. 16 that NASA would be successful &#39;&#39;only if it&#39;s pursuing a clear and broad national consensus with sustained and adequate funding,&#39;&#39; and he added, &#39;&#39;That hasn&#39;t been the case in three decades.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. O&#39;Keefe, responding to the letter on the orbital space plane, argued that the project was still at a conceptual stage and should proceed.</p> <p>Beyond establishing a commission to oversee NASA&#39;s progress, the Senate bill to be introduced on Wednesday seeks &#39;&#39;to address broader questions about the goals and methods we use,&#39;&#39; with specific concern for public and private investment in spaceflight and use of it. In remarks prepared for delivery on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Mr. Hollings argues that while economics of spaceflight should not take precedence over safety, &#39;&#39;we also know that, in the past, its cost has driven us down pathways that have not resulted in success.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>On the House side, Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee, introduced a bill that would have future accidents investigated by a presidential commission independent of NASA. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board began under a charter written after the Challenger accident, with members selected according to positions they held in the Air Force, Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.</p> <p>Mr. Gordon&#39;s bill was approved by a subcommittee but has gone no further.</p> <p>Mr. Hall, the ranking Democrat on the House Science Committee, introduced a bill on Oct. 1, with 24 sponsors, including 3 Republicans, that would have the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering assemble an oversight committee, as was done after the Challenger accident. NASA has generally opposed outside oversight.</p> <p>Mr. Hall also introduced an amendment to an appropriations bill that would mandate a $15 million study of shuttle crew escape, to be performed by NASA. The House passed the bill, and it is now in a conference committee.</p> <p>Representative Nick Lampson, Democrat of Texas, has introduced a measure that would require NASA to develop reusable spaceships that could sit for long periods balanced between the gravitational pull of Earth and the Sun or the Moon; ships that could reach an asteroid; and, ultimately, ones that could reach Mars. The bill has 24 sponsors but has not yet been taken up in committee.</p> <p>Mr. Lampson said in a telephone interview that he was glad that Senator Hollings was focused on the problem, but he added, &#39;&#39;We don&#39;t need a commission, we need a commitment for NASA.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If the goals get set, we will re-energize the academic community, and the space industrial community,&#39;&#39; he said, predicting that missions to Mars would &#39;&#39;do a great deal to move this country forward.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Hollings, in a separate interview, said, &#39;&#39;I want to go to Mars, too, but unless you get the culture changed and fixed, we&#39;re not going anywhere.&#39;&#39;</p>
1539113>Ignoring a Forest for the Tree Trimming From an ill-timed lunch to some too-tall trees, the immediate causes of the Aug. 14 blackout were made clear in a report issued last week. But a variety of experts now say the findings were too narrow, ignoring the federal government&#39;s role in the recent reshaping of the power industry. Two organizations that operate in the part of Ohio where the problems originated, FirstEnergy, a utility, and the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, or Midwest I.S.O., a regional agency that was supposed to be overseeing FirstEnergy, were created as part of the deregulation process.  <p>The report found that when the blackout hit, FirstEnergy and the Midwest I.S.O. were poorly prepared for their responsibilities.</p> <p>But the authors, including experts from the Energy Department and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, agencies that have been encouraging deregulation for years, did not address the question of how the industry assumed its current structure.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Maybe the report doesn&#39;t go there because the answer is not one that&#39;s comfortable politically,&#39;&#39; said Alan H. Richardson, the president of the American Public Power Association, a trade association for electric companies owned by states and cities. Mr. Richardson said examining the role of deregulation in the Midwest grid could have taken the Energy Department and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission &#39;&#39;to an area where they didn&#39;t want to go.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>That area is the federal role in encouraging the creation of the Midwest I.S.O., the transmission system operator. The report said that Midwest had the computer tools to diagnose the electric grid in its territory and make prompt changes in response to line failures, but that &#39;&#39;these systems are under development and not fully mature.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The agency was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in December 2001 as part of the transition to competitive electricity markets, and has members in 15 states from Texas to Ohio, and in the province of Manitoba.</p> <p>In detailing the Midwest I.S.O.&#39;s shortcomings, the report said that a computer technician at the agency shut down a computer program to fix it, and then went to lunch without turning it back on.</p> <p>An expert in electric transmission, Robert Blohm, asked, &#39;&#39;How come nobody has examined this horror story, of how they set up an entity 10 times more complex than any known one, in such a short period of time?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Nobody&#39;s gone into how prudently this was done,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Blohm, a consultant and member of the North American Electric Reliability Council, an industry group.</p> <p>Other experts were critical of the report&#39;s evaluation of FirstEnergy, which was cited for shortcomings that included improperly trimming trees under its power lines.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There are a lot of aspects in this blackout that have not been touched by this report,&#39;&#39; said another expert, John A. Casazza, a retired executive with Public Service Electric and Gas of New Jersey. &#39;&#39;The root causes that they name are not really the root causes. The root causes are what has happened as a result of our government policy.&#39;&#39; The problem, Mr. Casazza said, was that deregulation had &#39;&#39;provided the incentive to maximize profits now rather than provide long-range service,&#39;&#39; and basic maintenance like tree trimming.</p> <p>One transmission expert involved in the investigation said the ultimate cause of the blackout might be that &#39;&#39;we&#39;ve made it a lot more complicated with market rules and independent system operators,&#39;&#39; as the operation of the grid was adapted to competition. But, the expert said, &#39;&#39;The cause may be that people who were supposed to pay attention to reliability during the transition didn&#39;t.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The report also did not address whether unstable computer systems and poorly trained operators -- conditions cited in the report -- were prevalent around the country.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Energy Department, Jeanne Lopatto, said the task force had followed the mandate laid out by President Bush and the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chrétien. The report was an interim one, Ms. Lopatto said, and other experts were welcome to make suggestions at future public hearings.</p> <p>She added that there was no one else qualified to do the work involved in the report. &#39;&#39;I think you would be hard-pressed to find anyone with the technical expertise who was not somehow directly related to the electric industry,&#39;&#39; Ms. Lopatto said.</p> <p>The report, however, was compiled differently than some other government-sponsored reports on complex engineering challenges. To investigate the loss of the space shuttle Columbia, the government brought in independent experts. And for plane crashes, there is an entire agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, that is separate from the airlines, government aviation regulators and other interest groups.</p> <p>A senior investigator in the group that wrote the report on the blackout, speaking on condition that he not be more closely identified, said: &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re done with the process yet. Everything is on the table when it comes to recommendations.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>News Analysis</p>
347992>WEAPONS NOMINEE WITHDRAWS NAME Victor Stello Jr., the nuclear power expert nominated by President Bush to take charge of the nation&#39;s troubled nuclear weapons program, has asked that his nomination be withdrawn, the Department of Energy disclosed yesterday.  <p>In a letter sent to the White House Friday and released yesterday, Mr. Stello said the controversy over his tenure in his previous job, at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, made confirmation impossible &#39;&#39;in the forseeable future.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Since his nomination last July, Mr. Stello had been accused in several Congressional hearings of taking actions at the Commission that benefited the utilities that owned reactors but that also hurt safety. He was also accused of making contradictory statements to Congressional committees and allowing top-level commission officials to pursue a personal vendetta against another official.</p> <p>Mr. Stello, who will stay on at the department in a Civil Service position, also cited his health. He was severely injured in skiing accident in January, which he said had &#39;&#39;given me an opportunity to more sharply focus on those matters which I consider of significant personal importance.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>New Problems for Program</p> <p>Mr. Stello&#39;s decision creates new problems for the nuclear bomb complex, which is already largely shut down because of safety problems. The Secretary of Energy, James D. Watkins, had taken the unusual step of appearing personally before the Senate Armed Services Committee to ask for Mr. Stello&#39;s confirmation, saying that very few qualified people were willing to serve in his department. Four others turned down the job, he said, because the pay, $80,700, was too low.</p> <p>In his letter, Mr. Stello noted that the Senate Armed Services Committee had decided to delay action on his nomination until the Inspector General at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had completed an investigation. Mr. Stello said that he came to the department to help &#39;&#39;restore the viability of the nation&#39;s nuclear deterrent,&#39;&#39; but that the job required an assistant secretary for defense programs, the post to which he had been nominated, who could be confirmed quickly.</p> <p>Several organizations in Washington had campaigned vigorously against confirmation of Mr. Stello. At Greenpeace, an enviornmental group, Stephen I. Schwartz described the withdrawal as &#39;&#39;very good news.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There are very few people who are worse than Stello,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Schwartz, who said that given the nominee&#39;s history at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, his role at the Department of Energy would have been to continue policies of the past, &#39;&#39;deceit, coverups and emphasis on production over safety.&#39;&#39; $100 Billion Cleanup Bill The Department of Energy has acknowledged that past secrecy and coverup had created a cleanup bill that will run more than $100 billion, and that for years safety and environmental performance was paid far too little attention.</p> <p>Mr. Stello&#39;s nomination was also opposed by many nuclear experts in Washington because of his role in a complicated feud inside the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, where he was the chief staff official. In late 1987, Mr. Stello heard of allegations by an informer against Roger Fortuna, another commission staff member with whom Mr. Stello had had prior conflicts. Mr. Stello took the unusual step of authorizing a $6,000 cash payment to the informer.</p> <p>The informer, a former technican for the Niagra Mohawk Power Corporation, Douglas Ellison, also made allegations of widespread drug abuse at the Nine Mile Point nuclear complex, in Scriba, N.Y., but Mr. Stello later testified before Congress that he delayed looking into those allegations, even though he believed that they were probably true.</p> <p>Two former Government investigators testified to the Armed Services Committee that Mr. Stello had lied to them in an investigation of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident.</p> <p>As the nomination bogged down, Mr. Stello was designated last November as principal deputy assistant for defense programs, a position that does not require Senate confirmation. He will leave that job now, but will continue in his new job to assist with the reopening of the Savannah River reactors, the Government&#39;s only reactors for the production of tritium, a vital and perishable ingredient of nuclear bombs. He will also assist in reopening the Rocky Flats Plant, a factory near Denver that makes triggers for thermonuclear bombs.</p>
305171>The Nuclear Industry Tries Again Right now, the American nuclear power industry appears headed for extinction. Every plant of the more than 100 ordered since 1973 has been canceled, and many others are approaching retirement. But reactor manufacturers say that fears of global warming - the greenhouse effect - are giving them a second chance.  <p>Nuclear power advocates have, of course, been predicting the industry&#39;s rebirth for years. But the plans are becoming more specific, and political calculations are coming into play. Reactor builders are readying designs for a new generation of plants that, they say, will be far safer, less expensive and simpler to operate. The General Electric Company and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the two biggest reactor manufacturers, and General Atomic, a small company with an innovative reactor design, each received $50 million from the Department of Energy in September to work on their models. They are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to bring nuclear power back. And they are presenting the opposition with a tantalizing series of &#39;&#39;what-if&#39;s.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>* What if fundamental design changes made plants a hundred times safer? So safe that many elaborate safety features in today&#39;s plants - equipment that must be radiation-proof, fire-proof, tornado-proof and generally failure-proof - were not needed?</p> <p>* What if all the power and all the pumps and valves could fail, all the operators could be seized with indecision - and the plant would come through without further damage? Designers say such a plant is in their blueprints.</p> <p>* What if, as designers promise, the parts that are most likely to fail were redesigned or even eliminated? If many of the parts that are trickiest to install - like earthquake-proof piping with flawless welds - were drastically reduced? What if cost overruns were the worry of the manufacturer, not the utility and its customers? Would such a reactor sell?</p> <p>* What if plants that were licensed for construction were accepted by the gvernment once built, not subject to costly new requirements before completion, or after? New rules approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and now before Congress would accomplish as much, the industry&#39;s boosters say.</p> <p>Even those in the industry agreed that utility companies are unlikely to buy new plants soon. &#39;&#39;Anyone suggests a nuclear reactor to a utility board of directors, they will send for the guy with the net, and with good reason,&#39;&#39; said Shelby T. Brewer, head of the nuclear division at Combustion Engineering Inc. - a reactor manufacturer that has agreed to be bought out by ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd.</p> <p>But the manufacturers, who have been subsisting on paltry foreign sales, say they must prepare for a second nuclear age. With new equipment, new construction procedures and reformed regulation, they say, the orders will come. At Westinghouse, promotional material speaks of a new design &#39;&#39;restoring the domestic market.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The reactor vendors are counting on growing environmental consciousness and growing demand for electricity. The world&#39;s choices of other power sources will be constrained by fears of air pollution and global warming brought on by the burning of coal, oil and gas. As Hans Blix, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations agency based in Vienna, asked, &#39;&#39;Are you more scared of nuclear than of adding more carbon dioxide?&#39;&#39; The next few years, reactor manufacturers believe, will bring electricity shortages in this country and higher power needs abroad.</p> <p>Environmentalists are skeptical, suggesting that if there is a high-tech remedy for the greenhouse effect, it probably lies in more efficient light bulbs and motors, or photovoltaic cells and other new generating technologies. It is unclear what the leading technologies will be at the turn of the century, the very earliest that the first of a new generation of nuclear plants might be completed.</p> <p>Environmentalists also point out that even if all the nation&#39;s electricity came from reactors, global emissions of carbon dioxide would be cut by only about 3.5 percent.</p> <p>But utility executives say they would like a nuclear option; although mindful of public opposition and the huge cost overruns of the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s, they are not lining up to buy. At a recent conference on nuclear power and the greenhouse effect, organized by the Institute for Resource Management, an environmental group, many experts said the revival of the industry was a realistic possibility, but that it depended heavily on public opinion.</p> <p>As Alan Crane, senior associate project director at the Office of Technology Assessment put it at the conference: &#39;&#39;You can&#39;t just keep the utilities happy. There&#39;s a jury of 240 million people out there.&#39;&#39; Though polls show the public believes nuclear power will be important in the future, he said, &#39;&#39;Nobody would countenance one in their own backyard.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Though some new reactor features have been tested, others exist only on paper. But the industry&#39;s basic selling point is that eight pounds of uranium can make as much energy as 6,000 tons of oil or 8,600 tons of coal. A single large reactor could supply 1.5 million households. If that energy had to come from coal, each household would aggravate the greenhouse effect by burning half a ton of coal each month. Among currently economical technologies, only hydroelectric power and perhaps wood replaced by replanting can provide electricity without worsening the greenhouse effect. But both sources are limited.</p> <p>By themselves, these arguments sway few outside the nuclear community. Safety and cost, which killed off the market for the current generation of reactors, still must carry the day.</p> <p>The United States invented the civilian nuclear reactor as a spin-off from the bomb. For decades, in the &#39;&#39;Atoms for Peace&#39;&#39; era, the nuclear industry had a near-messianic tone. The nation&#39;s resulting disillusionment was all the more severe. Now American manufacturers say this country can use standardization and other reforms to make nuclear power work again - at least as well as the French, Japanese and Koreans, who all prosper with American designs. &#39;&#39;As we see the world,&#39;&#39; said Bert Wolfe, vice president for nuclear services at General Electric, &#39;&#39;it&#39;s hard to see how you can meet the energy needs in the next century without nuclear power.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>General Electric&#39;s Simplified Boiling Water Reactor and Westinghouse&#39;s Advanced Passive 600 are dramatic departures from the reactors these companies have built before. They are smaller, simpler and more forgiving and reliable. &#39;&#39;Even the current reactors tolerate a lot of stupidities,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Blix, in an interview at the United Nations. &#39;&#39;The ones that will come in the 90&#39;s will tolerate even more.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The designs for the 1990&#39;s differ in many ways, but all are only about half as large as the biggest now in service. General Atomic&#39;s plan is for even smaller reactors, which would be built in groups of up to four, with all four together only the size of a smallish plant today.  A Revolution in Design</p> <p>Down-sizing represents a revolution for reactor manufacturers, who, like auto makers, had long equated size with progress. For years the reactor designs grew larger because manufacturers thought the utilities could achieve economies of scale, generating more power with the same plant staff. But bigger plants took longer to build, raising costs and leaving utilities too dependent on single projects.</p> <p>Utilities also found that they had overestimated power demand for the early 1980&#39;s; smaller plants, more quickly built, do not require such accurate long-range projections. Smaller reactors also make it easier to design cooling systems without mechanical pumps or the need for quick action by operators.</p> <p>The other revolution in reactor concepts has been for vendors to complete their designs before they build. In the 1960&#39;s, utilities blithely broke ground on plants when only a quarter of the design was in hand, even when the plants were to be three or four times larger than any reactors already operating. &#39;&#39;Fast-tracking&#39;&#39; was the motto, with construction crews pouring foundations while engineers decided, in effect, where to put the kitchen and how many bedrooms to put upstairs. In a period of rapid inflation in building costs and high interest payments on an unfinished project, fast-tracking was meant to save money. Instead, it created confusion and raised costs, as piping ordered by one set of engineers often failed to fit equipment designed by another.</p> <p>Fast-tracking was especially difficult because the first generation of reactors included scores of one-of-a-kind designs. &#39;&#39;We had 50 separate learning curves,&#39;&#39; said Victor Gilinsky, a physicist and former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Virtually every plant was a prototype, and the experience of building one was of little help in building another. And there was no standardization in operations, either. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s as if the Navy had allowed every commander to design his own ship, hire his own contractor, designate his own ranks,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Gilinsky.</p> <p>Standardization is essential to swift construction, the experts say. As Howard J. Bruschi, the director of nuclear plant programs at Westinghouse, complained, &#39;&#39;The French are using Westinghouse reactors, and they build them in five years. We&#39;ve managed to stretch that to 14 in the United States.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Westinghouse and General Electric are both seeking generic approval for their designs from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by 1995. They also want one-step licensing, to replace the current process of applying for a construction permit and then, after construction is nearly done, applying again, for an operating license. Under the proposed changes, utilities could order a reactor the way a not-too-fussy homebuyer could order a house from stock plans, with only minor adjustments to conform to the particulars of a site.</p> <p>The commission has already approved simplified licensing for standardized plants. Watchdog groups have complained about the potential loss of public say, so the industry wants to head off legal challenges by having Congress write the simplified procedures into law.</p> <p>The new designs confront several other chronic problems of earlier nuclear reactors. Some examples:</p> <p>* In case of accident, existing reactors automatically pump in water to cool the fuel. But a cooling system failure could be catastrophic. New designs by Westinghouse and General Electric depend on gravity and convection to inject cold water and remove heat.</p> <p>* Existing reactors overheat quickly if cooling water flow is interrupted because they squeeze a large amount of fissionable uranium into a small space. Solution: Change the concentration of fissionable uranium in the fuel to lower the concentration of heat produced, by about 40 percent in General Electric plants and 30 percent in Westinghouse plants.</p> <p>* The current plants were plagued with questions about the adequacy of welds. As a result, one $2 billion plant, Zimmer, a General Electric design in Moscow, Ohio, is being converted to coal. Westinghouse has designed a new plant with long, gently curving pipes that have half the welds of a conventional design.</p> <p>* Reactors that boil water directly in the core now use pumps to circulate the water, but the stainless steel piping connected to the pumps has sometimes cracked. General Electric has designed a reactor that relies on natural convection instead of pumps to circulate water. This design also eliminates the need for large pipes to penetrate the reactor vessel below the level of the uranium core, so that if a pipe breaks, the water will not leak out.</p> <p>* Reactors today have emergency diesel generators, which provide power for crucial instruments, pumps and valves in case of a blackout. But the diesels require expensive maintenance and sometimes fail in tests, requiring a plant to close while they are fixed. Westinghouse has designed a plant that it says shuts down safely, dissipating heat with water delivered by gravity, convection and other passive means - without the use of valves, pumps or instruments, and thus without emergency diesel generators.  The Cost Contest</p> <p>Even an industry that meets all the safety criteria still faces huge challenges - most of all, cost. With more and more states requiring their utilities to solicit bids for new power supplies, rather than simply building another generating station and charging customers, nuclear will have to compete with new, highly fuel-efficient gas- and oil-fired generators.</p> <p>In extreme cases like New Hampshire&#39;s Seabrook nuclear plant, which recently took a major step toward operation, costs reached $5,400 per kilowatt of capacity. About $3,600 was for direct costs, the rest for interest payments. The Electric Power Research Institute, a utility research consortium in Palo Alto, Calif., believes that to be competitive, nuclear plants must be built for $1,500 a kilowatt in direct costs, a target that manufacturers believe they can meet. Westinghouse is convinced that its AP 600 can be built for $1,270 a kilowatt, not counting interest but including a 20 percent contingency fee.</p> <p>To limit costs, the builders of nuclear plants must limit construction time. &#39;&#39;If we&#39;re going to be effective with nuclear power,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Bruschi in an interview, &#39;&#39;we have to demonstrate as an industry, unequivocally, that these things can be built in a reasonable amount of time.&#39;&#39; Westinghouse, he said, can fulfill this goal with a strategy not used since the mid-1960&#39;s: the &#39;&#39;turnkey&#39;&#39; plant. It is sold at a fixed price, so the builder bears the risk of cost overruns.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I have been highly encouraged by conversations we&#39;ve had with utilities,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Bruschi, &#39;&#39;But no single utility is going to stick its neck out. So we&#39;re willing to go forward with a turnkey plant.&#39;&#39; The risk might be shared, he said, among Westinghouse, an architecture and engineering firm, and other contractors.</p> <p>Nuclear power opponents raise several other challenges. They question special subsidies and protections for the industry, like the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of reactor operators for accidents. &#39;&#39;What distinguishes nuclear power in benefit to the United States, that it is deserving of such treatment?&#39;&#39; asked Charles Imbrecht, the chairman of the California Energy Commission.</p> <p>The big reactor manufacturers, all of them divisions of larger companies, say Price-Anderson is a necessity for them to continue in the business. But Linden Blue, the vice chairman of General Atomic, said he is so convinced that his reactor could not cause damage beyond the plant boundaries that he would forswear the Price-Anderson benefits.  Suspect Subsidies</p> <p>Many energy experts question why the Department of Energy spends so much more to develop nuclear power than solar power or other technologies. Amory B. Lovins, a physicist and expert in electric efficiency, argues that skepticism over vendors&#39; cost claims will persist &#39;&#39;until the promoters pay for that commercialization, and stop importuning the Treasury to put our money where their mouths are.&#39;&#39; If the nuclear companies paid all their development costs, he said, they would build no new reactors. The same funds invested in energy conservation and efficiency would save far more power, he added.</p> <p>Another problem is nuclear waste. California has barred the construction of more reactors until the Federal Government demonstrates a way to dispose of waste. The Department of Energy is making little progress toward its goal of opening a repository early in the next century.</p> <p>Then there are decommissioning costs, unmeasured even for plants now in operation. Also uncertain is how much of a hazard a decommissioned plant would be. As I.C. Bupp, a reactor expert at the Cambridge Energy Research Associates consulting firm, put it: &#39;&#39;The public expects the option to tear it down and make a baseball field. If that option isn&#39;t there, I think you&#39;re going to have one heck of a political problem.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The industry is convinced it can meet these objections. The first new reactor, the thinking goes, will be built where others already exist, in a region with scarce coal but growing electric demand. The Southeast, including Florida, might provide a site.</p> <p>Until now, the industry&#39;s greatest obstacle has been its own sorry record. But business will revive, industry executives say, when it becomes obvious that a standardized plant can be built quickly, under a licensing system that prevents challenges and changing requirements along the way.</p> <p>With nuclear power in such disrepute, it may take more than just blueprints to persuade a utility to order that first new plant.As Mr. Wolfe of General Electric said, &#39;&#39;Someone is going to have to have faith that the system will work.&#39;&#39;</p>
308609>Report Contradicts Reason Given By Nuclear Official for an Inquiry An outside investigator has concluded that conflicts within the Nuclear Regulatory Commission led the agency to pursue a highly unusual investigation of a staff member last year. The conclusion contradicts an assertion by Victor Stello Jr., formerly the commission&#39;s chief of staff, that the reason for the inquiry was suspicion of wrongdoing that could affect safety.  <p>Mr. Stello has been nominated to be Assistant Secretary of Energy for defense programs, but the Senate Armed Services Committee has delayed action on his confirmation because of questions about his handling of the investigation and other actions he took while he was the chief staff official at the commission.</p> <p>The investigation of the staff member, Roger Fortuna, has already been the subject of several hearings and reports on Capitol Hill. Mr. Stello had had conflicts with Mr. Fortuna, who was responsible for investigating possible criminal wrongdoing in the civilian reactor industry. In late 1987, Mr. Stello heard of an informer&#39;s allegations that Mr. Fortuna had improperly disclosed agency business in a telephone conversation with Steven Comley, a nuclear power opponent in Massachusetts. Mr. Stello authorized a $6,000 cash payment to the informer, among other unusual steps.</p> <p>In a report dated Nov. 7 and not previously made public, the outside investigator, J. Brian Hyland, a former special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said &#39;&#39;the charges against Mr. Fortuna were blown out of proportion because of the personal and organizational animosity&#39;&#39; in the agency. The agent was brought in as an unbiased evaluator by the commission&#39;s inspector general.</p> <p>Mr. Hyland said Mr. Fortuna had not violated any laws, although he &#39;&#39;did not always adhere to the best practices of an investigative agency.&#39;&#39; Issue for Supervisor</p> <p>But if Mr. Fortuna had functioned inappropriately as an investigator, Mr. Hyland wrote, that was a matter between Mr. Fortuna and his supervisor, Ben Hayes. In Congressional testimony, Mr. Hayes has strongly supported Mr. Fortuna.</p> <p>The report was forwarded to the five members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Nov. 17.</p> <p>Mr. Stello has defended his actions in authorizing the cash payment, saying he believed that the informer had important information related to safety.</p> <p>Mr. Fortuna was suspended as an investigator and transferred to other duty. He was formally reprimanded for refusing to attend a hearing in his case without his lawyer present, but recently won a grievance proceeding and had the reprimand removed from his file.</p>
416668>E.P.A. Urging Electricity Efficiency In a rare Federal venture into electricity efficiency, the Environmental Protection Agency began a campaign yesterday to convince the nation&#39;s 1,000 largest businesses that they can reduce pollution, and increase profits, by buying better lights. The voluntary program will seek to persuade chief executives that investments in more efficient lighting in offices, stores and factories will return bigger profits than any other use of the money, while providing better working conditions and good public relations. The agency even plans to hand out &quot;environmental hero&quot; awards to executives who take part in the program, called Green Lights.  <p>If all businesses adopted commonly available high-efficiency lighting techniques, the agency said that about 11 percent of all the electricity used in this country would be saved and costs would drop by $18.6 billion a year. It also said, the national output of sulfur dioxide, the prime cause of acid rain, would fall 7 percent, and output of carbon dioxide, which is believed to cause global climate change, would fall 5 percent. A Different Approach</p> <p>&quot;This is a completely different way of approaching environmental problems,&quot; John S. Hoffman, director of the Global Change Division of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in an interview. When the Government wants to clean up the air, he said, it usually orders car makers to install catalytic converters or utilities to build scrubbers for smokestacks.</p> <p>The idea of saving money through efficiency has largely been a province of the utilities and the states that regulate them, and while many utilities have reported progress, most say they are only scratching the surface.</p> <p>Last week, the New York Power Authority, the largest state-owned power agency, announced a $50 million program to improve the efficiency of its electricity customers, which are other government agencies and nonprofit institutions.</p> <p>For the utilities, the goal has been to avoid having to build multibillion-dollar power plants -- keeping a growing customer population satisfied with a fixed amount of electricity -- by squeezing more light, more heat and more mechanical power from each kilowatt-hour. State utility commissions, eager to avoid the rate increases that often come with new power plants, have been prodding the utilities to do more, and concern over the environment has been cited as a side benefit.  Raising Energy Efficiency</p> <p>The Federal Government, which does not regulate utilities at the retail level, has focused its energy attention elsewhere. Washington&#39;s biggest efficiency push came in the last decade in cars, with new rules forcing higher gasoline mileage. The Department of Energy&#39;s biggest effort in the electric field has been the promotion of nuclear power. And after years of reluctantance, the Reagan White House agreed to a Congressional initiative that set standards raising the efficiency of new consumer appliances like refrigerators. But lighting was largely ignored.</p> <p>Since the Iraq invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Department of Energy has been on a short-term campaign to save energy, especially gasoline, led by James D. Watkins, the Energy Secretary.  &#39;Not Tokenism&#39;</p> <p>Charles Komanoff, an efficiency consultant based in New York, said in an interview, &quot;This is genuine efficiency, not tokenism.&quot;</p> <p>But he added that those who need to improve efficiency the most and who will have the most trouble doing it are not the country&#39;s thousand largest corporations, but small businesses, nonprofit groups and individuals. The E.P.A. plan is to focus on big companies first, because they use the most power.</p> <p>The technologies the E.P.A. is recommending include compact fluorescent lights, which screw into a standard socket but provide four times the efficiency; improved fluorescent tubes that give substantially more light; electronic ballasts, which do the same work as conventional magnetic ballasts in controlling the flow of electricity to fluorescent tubes but use only half the power and eliminate hum and flicker, and control devices that automatically shut off lights in a vacant room, or dim and brighten them to balance the amount of light entering through windows.</p> <p>Green Lights has already signed up 24 corporations, including Bell Atlantic, Citicorp, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Phillips Petroleum and Whirlpool.</p> <p>COMPANY NEWS</p>
789337>Computer Failures in Midwest Delay at Least 200 Airline Flights At least 200 airline flights were significantly delayed around the country yesterday after an air traffic control computer near Chicago and then a second system failed, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The main computer, which is 25 years old, normally handles nearly 10,000 planes a day through six Midwestern states. It failed to restart correctly early in the morning, after it was shut down for repairs the previous night. Then a second computer also briefly failed, which forced controllers to hold Midwest-bound planes on the ground around the country.  <p>The computer that would not restart was the same one that failed three times in July, also causing widespread delays. The F.A.A. decided last month to order an interim replacement, due in late 1997, to keep the system running until a permanent replacement can be installed.</p> <p>No accidents were reported yesterday, but two planes, one cruising at 20,000 feet and the other climbing from 19,000 feet, came too close, within 3.5 miles of each other horizontally and 700 feet vertically, violating the standard 5-mile, 1,000-foot separation. The incident occurred near Ottumwa, Iowa, southwest of Cedar Rapids.</p> <p>A spokesman for the controllers union, David M. Cottingham, said that a controller had simply overlooked the planes under the strain of keeping aircraft separated without the information that the broken computer usually provides. &quot;Under normal circumstances, the controller wouldn&#39;t even have considered himself to be busy,&quot; said Mr. Cottingham, but yesterday, he said, the controller had more than he could handle.</p> <p>But a spokesman for the F.A.A., Don Zochert, said that the incident had been classified as an operational error, and that there was no evidence that it would not have happened anyway.</p> <p>Enough controllers were on hand to provide two for each position, which is a normal practice in busy periods or when equipment fails, but there were not enough to allow breaks on a regular schedule. As a result, controllers routinely worked more than two hours at a stretch at their positions, which is supposed to be their limit, Mr. Cottingham said.</p> <p>&quot;They don&#39;t have any extra people to call in,&quot; Mr. Cottingham said.</p> <p>When the two planes came too close, an alarm sounded on the larger one, an ATR-72, which carries about 68 people. It had been climbing but the pilots put it into a dive. The other plane was what the F.A.A. calls a civil aircraft, meaning that it was not an airline plane.</p> <p>The computer that would not restart properly, an IBM 9020e, is supposed to provide warning of impending conflicts, and can project a plane&#39;s flight path on the screen.</p> <p>A more basic computer failed at 9:10 A.M. central time, one that, among other things, generates paper print-outs that controllers use to track planes, and lets them &quot;hand off&quot; control to other controllers as the plane moves from one jurisdiction to another. At that point, the F.A.A. ordered planes at airports around the country to stay on the ground rather than fly across the six-state region.</p> <p>That lasted for only 20 minutes, but the 9020e was held out of service all day. Technicians eventually got it running but were not ready to certify that it was operating right, said Mr. Zochert.</p>
1624156>Threat to Close Emergency Airfield in Pacific Upsets Airlines The Bush administration is threatening to shut an airfield at Midway Atoll in the mid-Pacific that has been available as an emergency landing site for decades. The airlines say the closing would force many two-engine planes flying between North America and Asia to make a long detour to hug the coastline of Alaska and the Russian far east, and could force some flight cancellations. Three- and four-engine planes are not required to stay within a certain range of emergency fields. But safety experts say that these planes will still face increased risk in flying the mid-Pacific route, because they will be farther from land in case of fire, system failure or passenger illness, which are the main reasons for emergency landings.  <p>The airlines are furious. &#39;&#39;It seems like the government has just lost sight of the importance of Midway,&#39;&#39; said Gene Cameron, the manager of flight dispatching at United Airlines. Dispatchers plan aircraft routes based on prevailing winds and, especially in flights over water, availability of alternate landing spots.</p> <p>But the Transportation Department, which has paid $3.5 million to the Interior Department to keep the airfield open for the last few months, is determined to stop. &#39;&#39;There is no other airport available to commercial interests that we pay to operate,&#39;&#39; said Brian Turmail, a Transportation Department spokesman.</p> <p>Midway was a naval base until 1993, and for several years after that its operation was financed by a private company that brought in visitors for &#39;&#39;eco-tourism.&#39;&#39; When that venture failed, the Interior Department, which controls the atoll, said it would stop paying to operate the airfield. The Transportation Department began picking up the costs in late 2002 but does not want to bear the long-term obligation.</p> <p>On Friday, the Transportation Department said that it would pay about $300,000 to keep the field open until Nov. 20 and that it would meet with the airlines to discuss the field&#39;s economic and safety significance. Along with the airlines, which are in financial distress, a possible contributor is Boeing, which met some of Midway&#39;s costs in the 1990&#39;s. Boeing specializes in two-engine aircraft, while its rival Airbus concentrates on four-engine models.</p> <p>Midway is 2,800 miles west of San Francisco, 2,200 miles east of Japan and about 150 miles east of the international date line. Planes bound to Asia from North America usually fly near the Aleutians and the Russian far east because of prevailing winds, but tend to return on a more southerly route.</p> <p>Mr. Cameron of United Airlines said he calculated that a Boeing 777 that had to return on the northerly route instead would take nearly 90 minutes longer to reach the west coast of the United States and burn nearly $4,000 more fuel.</p> <p>Continental Airlines plans to begin service on Dec. 15 from Nagoya, Japan, to Honolulu in a Boeing 767, a twin-engine plane. But without Midway available, it will probably drop the route, said Rahsaan Johnson, a Continental spokesman. Under rules for twin-engine planes, the 767 would have to follow a circuitous route to stay within range of Micronesia, he said, and the airline would have to leave seats or cargo holds empty so it could carry enough fuel. &#39;&#39;We&#39;d be flying a plane full of fuel,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>A Boeing 777 flown by Continental made an unscheduled stop in Midway in January because of an engine problem. Northwest and American would also be affected.</p> <p>Another possible site for diversions is Wake Island, but it is more than 1,100 miles away. In a recent letter to the Office of Management and Budget, two Democrats in the Senate, Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii and Patty Murray of Washington, complained that this was &#39;&#39;longer than the distance between Washington, D.C., and Miami.&#39;&#39; The Wake airfield is unavailable at night while lighting repairs are completed; airline officials do not expect to be able to use it before the end of the year.</p> <p>The amount of money at stake at Midway is under dispute. The Transportation Department said the cost would run to about $6 million a year. The airlines say that data they received from the Interior Department puts the cost of the airfield at about $1 million when separated from other costs on the island, which is a national wildlife refuge and includes a memorial to the Americans who died in the historic naval engagement there in 1942. The airfield has a simple radio navigation beacon and runway lights, but no tower.</p> <p>Duane Woerth, the president of the Air Line Pilots Association, put the cost at $600,000 a year. &#39;&#39;I&#39;m really ripped about this ridiculous loss of safety,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;This is an inherently governmental function. They keep trying to outsource this inherently governmental responsibility.&#39;&#39;</p>
869727>JET&#39;S LANDING GEAR IS SAID TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF BOMB The front landing gear of the Boeing 747 that crashed off the coast here on July 17 shows such heavy damage that some investigators are convinced that it is the strongest evidence yet that the plane was destroyed by a bomb, Federal investigators said tonight. The investigators believe that the landing gear was blown off the plane by a  bomb blast. But several senior law enforcement officials said tonight that the finding still fell short of the definitive evidence that they said they needed before they could declare the crash the result of a criminal act.  <p>The landing gear would have been retracted into its housing inside the fuselage long before the plane exploded, and the hydraulic mechanism that retracts it was found to have &quot;serious concussive damage,&quot; the result of a violent blow or impact, a Federal investigator said. &quot;By the way it had been smashed, the bomb experts thought it had been very close to the source of the explosion.&quot;</p> <p>The front cargo hold carrying passengers&#39; baggage was just behind the landing gear. The first-class seating area was above. Investigators said this evening that they believe a bomb might have been in a passenger&#39;s bag -- or perhaps in a food cart or a bathroom in the cabin above.</p> <p>For the last several days, law enforcement officials investigating the crash  of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 have been saying privately that they believed the plane was destroyed by a bomb, but they have been waiting to find a piece of clear physical evidence to support their theory. The latest discovery caused a stir among the divers, Navy and Coast Guard technicians and Federal agents who recovered the landing gear on Saturday.</p> <p>Samples of apparent residue found on the landing gear have been sent to the F.B.I. lab in Washington to find if they hold chemical traces of an explosive. Thus far, they have not found such conclusive chemical evidence.</p> <p>One investigator who viewed the hydraulic unit described the damage as &quot;more  like a crack than a tear.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;The vast majority of the wreckage has been these torn, mangled pieces of thin metal, from the fuselage,&quot; he added. &quot;This was a huge piece of thick steel, and it had been blasted is the only way to describe it.</p> <p>&quot;For more than a week,&quot; he said, &quot;everyone had been sifting through this wreckage, desperately searching for some sign of the explosion, but not really knowing exactly what we were looking for. Then when you see it, the kind of visible damage that had been done, you just know.&quot;</p> <p>Investigators also said today that a cargo door, presumably the front one, had been found significantly closer to Kennedy International Airport than almost all of the other parts located so far, tending to support the theory that a bomb blew up in the forward cargo hold, blowing off the door.</p> <p>The plane, bound for Paris with 230 passengers and crew members, was, in essence, decapitated as it was climbing to about 13,700 feet, spreading wreckage over several miles. The main section of the plane, engines apparently still running, flew on and plummeted to about 8,500 feet. There, it exploded in a fireball that was visible for miles.</p> <p>The senior Navy officer here, Rear Adm. Edward K. Kristensen, acknowledged today that the rush to recover human remains ahead of wreckage had slowed the search for evidence, perhaps causing investigators to lose chances to obtain information that could have been gleaned from the wreckage.</p> <p>Today, the Suffolk County Medical Examiner, Dr. Charles V. Wetli, identified  the body of a flight engineer who had been riding in the cockpit as an observer. But the divers who recovered the body had no idea whose body it was at the time  they brought it to the surface.</p> <p>&quot;The ID isn&#39;t done until later in the process,&quot; he said. But by then, the divers were unable to recall where the body had been when they retrieved it. That could be important because searchers do not believe that they have found the cockpit yet, and that is probably where the flight engineer was sitting.</p> <p>Divers are continuing to labor in debris fields that two of them today described as being like underwater junkyards. Little natural light penetrates to the bottom, so their visibility is limited to a few feet. Technicians on ships on the surface, viewing the scene through cameras in the divers&#39; helmets that cannot zoom in or out, have an even murkier picture.</p> <p>The searchers have now recovered 171 bodies, and 165 have been positively identified. Of those, 157 have been returned to next of kin. The number of families at the Ramada Plaza Hotel near Kennedy, once more than 175, is now fewer than 50.</p> <p>Investigators were also cheered today by the arrival of a second Navy salvage tugboat, the Grapple, which went immediately into the complicated business of mooring itself without further damaging the wreckage below while also setting itself up to maneuver gradually over the debris field that holds much of the forward part of the plane. It was expected to begin lowering divers into the water at about midnight.</p> <p>Also arriving today was a British official who helped investigate the Pan Am  103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. That plane was brought down by a  bomb, and investigators have found several similarities between that crash and this one.</p> <p>Robert T. Francis, the vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, continued to stress today that recovering human remains would take precedence whenever remains were found. But he added that some of the equipment  at the scene was useful only for hoisting up debris. Divers rigged some of the debris for hoisting previously and marked it with buoys. The total of bodies recovered rose by 10 today, but Mr. Francis cautioned that the pace might slow.  He has said he does not expect that all the bodies will be recovered.</p> <p>Admiral Kristensen said the third of the four engines had been found, in pieces. Engine break-up in flight can make a plane crash, but the admiral said the early assessment was that this engine had been damaged when it hit the water.</p> <p>A formal declaration that the plane was brought down by a bomb would mark only a symbolic milepost for the safety board, which will continue work here for weeks helping to recover parts, and for the F.B.I., which already has a full-scale criminal investigation under way.</p> <p>The F.B.I., however, has been holding off completing some witness interviews  until it was clear that the crash was a crime.</p> <p>Within the investigative team, two different schools of thought have emerged  about the cause of the crash. While most investigators believe a bomb brought down the airline, others still insist that there is not enough hard evidence to  declare it a bombing. Besides, they say, the plane could have been hit by a missile or rocket, and a few still insist that mechanical failure is an outside  possibility. The senior officials in charge have decided that they are not going to make the announcement of the cause until everyone within the investigation agrees on it and at least one critical piece of forensic evidence is identified.</p> <p>At the end of nearly two weeks of work, the recovery teams have little of the plane in hand, but they do have a small flotilla of ships and boats at work, and a small army of divers, well over 100. This probably would not change if officials announced that they had evidence of a bomb because that would merely answer the what, not the how, and especially not the who of the incident.</p> <p>FATE OF FLIGHT 800: THE OVERVIEW</p>
292562>Chemicals in A-Plant Pose Blast Risk In an effort to squeeze more waste into giant tanks at a nuclear weapons plant in Washington State, engineers in the 1950&#39;s added chemicals that created the risk of an explosion, according to a Government study completed five years ago but not made available until now.  <p>Experts say that if such a blast occured it would shatter the tank and disperse its intensely radioactive contents.</p> <p>Managers of the plant, the Hanford Nuclear Reservation near Richland, say they do not believe that the tanks of radioactive waste could detonate because temperatures are too low. But they do not dispute the report&#39;s observation that the chemicals in the tanks &#39;&#39;have been shown to undergo explosive reactions when heated.&#39;&#39; Not Certain About Safety</p> <p>In addition, they acknowledge that they cannot be certain about the safety of the tanks until they complete studies to determine exactly what is in them.</p> <p>The study was performed in 1984 by a company hired by the Department of Energy, the Battelle Memorial Institute, and kept secret until a few weeks ago because it &#39;&#39;left some unanswered questions,&#39;&#39; said the manager of the tanks, Donald B. Wodrich.</p> <p>But the results of the study have come out in connection with confirmation hearings being held by the Senate Armed Services Committee for members of a new oversight panel for the nation&#39;s 12-state nuclear weapons complex.</p> <p>The Hanford reservation is now operated by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, but was managed by the Rockwell International Corporation, through its subsidiary, Rockwell Hanford Operations, at the time the draft report was issued by a Battelle subsidiary, Pacific Northwest Laboratories.</p> <p>Senator John Glenn of Ohio, a Democratic member of the Armed Services Committee, said he intends to seek answers to questions raised by the report at the committee session today. The report was made available by Senator Glenn&#39;s staff.</p> <p>The study found that cyanide added in the 1950&#39;s to help separate the radioactive metals from the liquid waste could be explosive if it were concentrated and heated. While cyanide is not itself explosive, it forms a combustible mixture in combination with nitrates and nitrites, which are present in the tanks. Potential of 36 Tons of TNT</p> <p>In the &#39;&#39;worst case,&#39;&#39; the report said, the material had the explosive potential of 36 tons of TNT, six times the force of the blast that tore apart the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983. Although such an explosion would not be nuclear, Mr. Wodrich said it would rupture the tank and disperse radioative particles.</p> <p>A chemical explosion involving such wastes at a nuclear weapons plant forced the evacuation of tens of thousands in the Ural Mountains of the Soviet Union in 1957, Soviet officials have recently made public.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The Soviet explosion shows that we&#39;re not dealing with an abstract problem here,&#39;&#39; Senator Glenn said, Mr. Wodrich said the heat in the tanks, produced by radioactive decay, has been measured at 135 degrees Fahrenheit, more than 300 degrees lower than the combustion point for the chemical wastes.</p> <p>But other experts said the materials are unevenly dispersed, and that higher temperatures could be present in areas where the cyanide is more heavily concentrated. The Battelle study calls for an investigation to determine how the wastes are distributed inside the tank and where the combustible chemicals are concentrated.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;At present, there is insufficient information to state that the hazard of a potentially violent cyanide reaction does not exist,&#39;&#39; said a draft version of the study, dated November 1984. Mr. Wodrich said the Government hopes to issue a final version by next summer. Glenn Plans to Raise Issue</p> <p>The author of the study, Lee L. Burger, an employee of Battelle, said yesterday that he believed Rockwell had decided not to make the draft public.</p> <p>Mr. Glenn said he planned to raise the issue of the waste tanks today in the hearing for five nominees to a new Nuclear Defense Safety Board, which will oversee the nation&#39;s nuclear weapons complex. Senator Glenn, who is chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, sponsored the legislation that created the board.</p> <p>The wastes at the Hanford plant, situated on the Columbia River, are the product of 40 years of manufacturing plutonium for nuclear bombs dating from the Manhattan Project. Large sections of the complex have been closed for safety reasons, but the wastes are still being generated.</p> <p>The plutonium is made in the fuel rods of nuclear reactors, and the rods are then removed from the reactor, chopped up and dissolved in acids. Most of the plutonium is removed, leaving radioactive forms of cesium, strontium and other atoms that are made when the uranium is split in the reactor.</p> <p>To handle these wastes, which will be dangerous for tens of thousands of years, the Government built steel tanks, 75 feet in diameter and about 15 feet high and buried under 6 to 8 feet of concrete and dirt. Later, bigger tanks were built.</p> <p>But by the mid-1950&#39;s, the tanks were filling up, and from 1954 to 1957 engineers added potassium ferrocyanide, because it binds readily with metals. The cyanide bound with the cesium and sank to the bottom of the tanks, allowing workers to pump liquid from the tops of the tanks and dump it into earthen pits. Mixture Explodes at 730 Degrees</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Mixed with nitrates or nitrites, both of which are present in the tanks, cyanide has been shown to undergo explosive reactions when heated,&#39;&#39; the report said.</p> <p>After reading the report, engineers at Hanford began removing samples of the wastes and heating them. Mr. Wodrich said a chemical reaction that generates heat begins at about 460 degrees Fahrenheit. At 730 degrees, the mixture explodes.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;What we find in our tanks that have ferrocyanide in them, the hottest of all those tanks is 135 degrees,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>But an expert in nuclear waste said that the level of risk is largely unknown, and added that the Department of Energy&#39;s secrecy worried him.</p> <p>The expert, F. Robert Cook, said: &#39;&#39;You don&#39;t know with any precision what the conditions are locally in those tanks. It may not be evenly mixed.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Cook, a former civilian employee who worked on submarine reactors and later was an official at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said he has been trying to obtain the report since April 1988, but was told he it would not be made public because it was merely a draft.</p> <p>But Mr. Wodrich said the draft report had been made public &#39;&#39;within the last two or three months,&#39;&#39; because its existence had become widely known. He said that the plan was to release a final version next summer, either incorporating the results of studies now under way that would show there was no hazard, or adding those studies in a separate report.</p> <p>A memorandum on the cover sheet in 1984 said, &#39;&#39;The subject matter is expected to be of interest only to Rockwell Hanford Operations and Pacific Northwest Laboratories and should be disseminated only to DOE and DOE contractors.&#39;&#39;</p>
1706755>Near Miss for 2 Jets on a Las Vegas Runway An America West passenger jet taking off from Las Vegas missed hitting an Air Canada jet by about 100 feet last Thursday night, according to a preliminary report, because a controller in the tower confused two planes and issued conflicting instructions. The controller has been taken off duty and sent for more training, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, and the episode is under investigation.  <p>America West Flight 539, departing for Cleveland, was cleared for takeoff about 11 p.m. local time on Runway 25 Right. At the same time, Air Canada Flight 593 had landed on Runway 25 Left, a parallel runway, on a flight from Toronto, and had been cleared to taxi to the terminal, across 25 Right. A collision was averted because the America West plane was airborne by the time it reached the point where the Air Canada plane was crossing.</p> <p>The America West and Air Canada planes were both midsized Airbus jets that carry more than 100 passengers.</p> <p>An F.A.A. spokeswoman said Wednesday that the agency did not believe that the America West plane had flown directly over the Air Canada plane, but that investigators were still trying to determine how close the two jets came.</p> <p>Donn Walker, an F.A.A. spokesman, said the tower controller had cleared the America West plane for takeoff. Then a different America West plane, a Boeing 757, taxiing behind Flight 539, asked for a brief delay. The controller responded by revoking the takeoff clearance for the 757 -- although he had never issued one for that plane -- and cleared the Air Canada plane to cross the runway. Meanwhile Flight 539, duly cleared, rolled down the runway for takeoff.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Our system is set up as much as possible to absorb human error and still not have a collision,&#39;&#39; Mr. Walker said.</p> <p>He said, as did others, that the aviation agency had computer systems in place that would alert controllers to some kinds of human error, like pilots not following directions because they misheard an instruction or got lost in the field, but that it did not have an automatic system for warning controllers about confusing two airplanes.</p> <p>In July at Kennedy International Airport in New York, a DC-8 cargo plane nearly hit a fully loaded Boeing 767 that blundered onto the active runway. The tower controller could not spot the problem because of heavy rain and clouds that cut visibility to near zero and made radar ineffective. The aviation agency has a system for seeing through clouds and rain, using signals given off by the planes themselves, as opposed to radar, which bounces electromagnetic energy off the planes&#39; skins. But the agency has not installed it at Kennedy.</p>
1768697>Amtrak Takes Action to Ease Delays During Power Failures In response to last month&#39;s widespread power failure, Amtrak has put a rescue locomotive near the entrance to the Hudson River train tunnel system between New Jersey and Pennsylvania Station to remove stranded trains. In a letter to New Jersey Transit, whose trains run on Amtrak&#39;s rails, Amtrak said the rescue engine, with a crew and special coupling equipment, was among several steps being taken to help the railroads recover more quickly from power failures, like the ones on May 25 and last Friday.  <p>But Amtrak has not found out why the failures were so extensive, and it wants to bring in an outside group of experts to evaluate the blackouts. It described the May 25 failure, which stretched from Washington to New York, as the worst in 23 years, and said the cause was the failure of two devices to share the power load properly; one is owned by Amtrak and the other by the Philadelphia Electric Company.</p> <p>The letter, dated Wednesday, was from David J. Hughes, the acting president of Amtrak, to George Warrington, the executive director of New Jersey Transit. Mr. Warrington said in a statement on Thursday that New Jersey Transit shared Amtrak&#39;s interest &#39;&#39;in bringing this to closure to ensure that future outages do not occur.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>On May 25, 30,000 New Jersey Transit passengers were delayed, along with 4,200 Amtrak passengers, as well as commuters on suburban lines in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington. Three of the New Jersey trains, with hundreds of commuters, stalled in the tunnels. Amtrak&#39;s letter also disclosed that a third electric disruption occurred last Saturday, but said each disruption appeared to have a different cause. On May 25, the rescue of the first train from the tunnel system went smoothly, but the &#39;&#39;removal of the other two N.J.T. trains took much too long.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>One problem was that coupling equipment on the locomotives and the trains, called knuckles, was incompatible. The locomotive now standing by near the tunnels is equipped with &#39;&#39;all necessary compromise knuckles,&#39;&#39; the letter said.</p> <p>Amtrak buys electricity from utility companies that offer alternating current with 60 cycles a second, the American standard, but its trains run on an archaic 25-cycle system. Amtrak said it was now staffing one of its frequency converter stations, near Philadelphia, 24 hours a day.</p> <p>In a fact sheet with the letter, Amtrak said it owns three of six power supply stations between Washington and New York, the oldest built in 1992. But it described the other three as &#39;&#39;1930&#39;s era.&#39;&#39; One of those is owned by Public Service Gas &amp; Electric, one by Philadelphia Electric and one by Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light and Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric. The three Amtrak installations are electronic, and the three owned by the utility companies are mechanical.</p> <p>Amtrak said the power failure last Friday, which lasted 45 minutes, occurred when a Philadelphia Electric Company transmission line took itself out of service during a thunderstorm, causing the frequency converter to shut down. Amtrak said it was not clear why. The failure on Saturday occurred when a tree hit a power line.</p> <p>Amtrak&#39;s six supply stations can provide more than twice the amount of electricity that the trains require during rush periods, but on May 25 one station had been closed for maintenance.</p>
1377148>EgyptAir Pilot Sought Revenge By Crashing, Co-Worker Said A former EgyptAir pilot told American investigators two years ago that the co-pilot of EgyptAir 990 crashed the plane into the Atlantic Ocean to take revenge on a company executive who had just demoted him and was riding as a passenger, a person involved in the investigation said today. American aviation investigators say they do not know whether the explanation given by the pilot, which was first reported today in The Los Angeles Times, is true. Since the crash of the Boeing 767, Egyptian officials have argued that there was no evidence that the co-pilot, Gamil al-Batouti, committed suicide.  <p>For their part, American investigators have focused mainly on whether a mechanical flaw caused the crash. They concluded that it did not and now firmly believe that Mr. Batouti deliberately crashed the plane into the Atlantic about 60 miles south of Nantucket, killing himself and all 216 others on board.</p> <p>The Los Angeles Times said it conducted nine hours of interviews with a former EgyptAir pilot, Hamdi Hanafi Taha, who laid out the revenge motive.</p> <p>Mr. Taha said that EgyptAir&#39;s chief Boeing 767 pilot, Hatem Rushdy, had told Mr. Batouti that he would be taken off the United States route because of accusations of sexual misconduct.</p> <p>Mr. Taha sought asylum in London a few months after the October 1999 crash, saying he feared persecution in Egypt because of his revelations about the state-owned airline. At that time, Egyptian officials said that Mr. Taha did not have any information about the crash.</p> <p>American investigators did confirm that Mr. Batouti had been told he was being taken off the route and that Captain Rushdy was a passenger on the flight.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The thing that was clear was, he did it,&#39;&#39; said an American official involved in the investigation.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Why, I don&#39;t know that we&#39;ll ever know,&#39;&#39; the official said, &#39;&#39;but this is what the defector&#39;s story was.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Egyptian investigators might have been able to establish a motive but did not seek to do so, the official said, with the Egyptians saying the cause might be a failure in the system that maintains the plane&#39;s nose-up and nose-down attitude.</p> <p>Removal from the route from Cairo to Los Angeles with a stop in New York, would have been a financial blow for a pilot who was likely to supplement his modest salary by buying consumer goods in the United States and selling them in Egypt.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;That was how these guys made a living,&#39;&#39; said the American official.</p> <p>The chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Marion C. Blakey, said on Thursday that her agency might issue its final report next week. But people at the board say although the report will say the co-pilot crashed the plane, it will not explore his motive.</p>
271719>What Exxon Will Be Leaving Behind AFTER the Valdez oil spill off the coast of Alaska last March, Exxon promised to do something that many environmentalists said was impossible: clean 11 million gallons of oil from hundreds of miles of shoreline and thousands of square miles of water. Last week, the company seemed well on its way to accomplishing something that might seem equally improbable: spending $1.25 billion on the cleanup, or about $10 million a day, while making hardly anyone happy.  <p>It has now become obvious that oil coats rocks and seeps into crevices a lot more easily than it can be hosed off and sucked up by waiting skimmers. Exxon, the Federal Government and the state of Alaska all agree that beyond a certain point, spraying hot water on oily beaches does more harm than good. No amount of money will make Prince William Sound look as it did before the disaster. Now officials are in the tough position of having to decide when Exxon has done all that it can reasonably be expected to do.</p> <p>How much can be spent effectively is only one question. The other is how much damage was done, and that will probably be decided in court. The Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency are investigating, and scores of private parties have already filed suit.</p> <p>Even without counting the liability suits, the cost of the spill has been enormous. The company said last week that it had set aside $850 million - more than 80 percent of what it earned for the quarter that ended June 30 - to pay for the cleanup. It had already set aside $30 million for the tanker and the cargo, and said that insurance would pay for more than $400 million. Pricing a Disaster</p> <p>About $600 million has already been spent to put 3,000 people on the beaches of Prince William Sound and 7,500 more in supporting roles, and to deploy 50 landing craft, two dozen barges, swarms of helicopters and small planes and hundreds of tons of equipment and supplies.</p> <p>The sum is staggering in comparison with what has been spent on earlier spills. Union Oil paid $16.7 million in damages and spent $11 million on the cleanup for the January 1969 oil spill off Santa Barbara channel. The cost is also huge compared with the price of repairing the damage of some recent natural disasters. For example, Exxon has promised to spend more than three times the estimated cost of cleaning up after the earthquake that struck Whittier, Calif., in October 1987. The cost approaches that of the worst industrial accidents, like Three Mile Island, where a billion-dollar asset turned into a billion-dollar liability in a few hours. Exxon is, in effect, buying back its oil for $116 per gallon, roughly 250 times the pre-spill price.</p> <p>Is that enough, either in terms of work accomplished or as penance? As the ink was drying on all the zeroes, the company was responding to complaints about an internal memo, first made public by United Press International, that listed a &#39;&#39;non-negotiable&#39;&#39; date for demobilizing the army of cleanup workers -Sept. 15, which is about the time that winter storms arrive.</p> <p>Exxon said that by the middle of this month it had treated about 500 miles of the 730 miles of shoreline it had promised to tackle in its May 24 cleanup plan. It has deployed more personnel and equipment than promised, the company said earlier this month. But the state of Alaska, which is preparing to sue Exxon, sees the situation differently. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s not enough to declare victory and go home,&#39;&#39; said Gov. Steve Cowper. Achieving Stability</p> <p>In the Gulf of Alaska, into which Prince William Sound empties, there is still so much oil on the water that tarballs are washing up on virgin beaches, said the Governor&#39;s spokesman, David Ramseur. In some places, tide changes are still taking oil off one beach and putting it on another. Mr. Ramseur maintained that the $1.25 billion cleanup &#39;&#39;probably is not enough.&#39;&#39; But Samuel K. Skinner, who as Secretary of Transportation oversees the Coast Guard, said, &#39;&#39;Exxon basically has done everything they told the government and me they would do.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In Alaska on Tuesday, after his memo on the cutoff date was made public, Exxon&#39;s manager in Valdez, Otto Harrison, insisted that he did not preclude a return of the cleanup crews in the spring.</p> <p>William Stevens, president of Exxon USA, told a Congressional committee on Friday that his company would comply with any &#39;&#39;reasonable request&#39;&#39; to do more clean-up work next spring. President Bush said he was encouraged by that, but added: &#39;&#39;If I had the feeling Exxon was going to pull back on an agreement, or fail to fulfill an agreement they&#39;d made with us, with the Government, or with the state of Alaska, I would be very much exercised about that and try my best to do something about it.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>On Wall Street the overall effect has hurt Exxon. The stock price dropped by 3.6 percent after the quarterly report. Despite the huge cost of the cleanup, however, Exxon raised its dividend 5 cents, to 60 cents for the quarter. If the recent news on profits did not justify the increase, perhaps public relations did. As George F. Friesen, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, suggested, &#39;&#39;They felt they had to do something to counter that news.&#39;&#39;  IDEAS &amp; TRENDS</p>
583465>Building Less Expensive Solar Arrays Taking a new approach to large-scale production of electricity from sunlight, a New Jersey company has built a five-acre array of photovoltaic cells of the type normally found in pocket calculators and wristwatches. The array, which produces power for Pacific Gas and Electric, was built in Davis, Calif. It uses a thin film of amorphous silicon sandwiched between two pieces of glass. Earlier arrays built to supply utilities used silicon crystals, which capture a larger fraction of the sun&#39;s energy but are more expensive to build.  <p>The company, Advanced Photovoltaic Systems Inc. of Princeton, N.J., announced on Monday that a cooperative research project called Photovoltaics for Utility Scale Applications in Davis had accepted its array after a one-year test period. The acceptance means the cells meet standards for reliability and durability set by utilities.</p> <p>Thin-film cells are cheap, relative to crystal cells, because of stingy use of materials; with an active layer that is just 1.5 microns thick, the most expensive part of the cells is the plate glass.</p> <p>But in making large thin-film cells, manufacturers have had trouble keeping the layers even; as a result, the cells lost efficiency and showed odd rainbows of color, according to Ronald W. Matlin, Advanced Photovoltaic&#39;s director of power systems. But his company has succeeded in building cells that are 31 inches by 61 inches.</p> <p>Thin-film cells capture only about 4.5 percent of the sun&#39;s energy, half what crystalline cells can achieve, and skeptics have argued that even the crystalline cells take up so much space that they cannot be useful for bulk power generation.</p> <p>But Mr. Matlin pointed out that in his company&#39;s installation, the value of the equipment was $400,000 an acre; compared with that, he said, land is a minor component, because it is generally available at $1,000 to $10,000 an acre.</p> <p>Costs are still high, about 25 cents a kilowatt-hour, compared with a national average retail selling price of about 8 cents for the electricity that utilities make from all sources. But a solar system incurs no costs for acid rain, global warming or other pollution or reliance on depletable natural resources, domestic or imported, he pointed out. And there is room to improve efficiency, raising the power output of a cell of a given size, which would cut costs, he said; in addition, fabrication costs are falling with increasing automation.</p> <p>The new thin-cell system takes up roughly the same space as a crystalline array, Mr. Matlin said, because, following the cheap route, the cells are mounted on simple platforms that do not track to follow the sun. Platforms that track, as are commonly used for crystalline cells, must be spaced farther apart to avoid putting one in the shadow of the next.</p> <p>BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
872063>Fourth Luggage Bin Found in Air Crash As Mystery Deepens Divers have recovered the last of four luggage containers that Trans World Airlines Flight 800 had been carrying in its forward cargo hold and have found that the large metal box, like the others retrieved earlier, showed no visible evidence of damage from a bomb, investigators announced this afternoon. The finding threw serious doubt into a leading theory of investigators, that the Boeing 747 that crashed on July 17, killing 230 people, was brought down by a bomb secreted in passengers&#39; luggage.  <p>Divers brought up the fourth container on Saturday, and James K. Kallstrom, the senior F.B.I. officer on the case, said this afternoon that all four luggage containers &#39;&#39;are basically unremarkable, although the testing has not been completed.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Nonetheless, investigators with both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Transportation Safety Board all said today that they still believed it remained probable that a bomb caused the explosion and crash.</p> <p>Tonight, a senior investigator said: &#39;&#39;I think it potentially closes out one area where the bomb might have been. But by no stretch of the imagination does it mean a bomb did not blow up the airplane. All it does is rule out those four containers as the place where a bomb was hidden.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But for that theory to be so, the explosives would have had to have been hidden somewhere else.</p> <p>One senior investigator said last night that an emerging theory is that a bomb was placed under a seat in the middle part of the cabin, possibly above the center fuel tank . Investigators have also said an explosive could have been stored in an overhead bin, or hidden in a food cart that was then loaded onto the plane.</p> <p>At the former Grumman hangar in Calverton, L.I., investigators are reconstructing pieces of the plane from the rear of the forward cargo hold to the back of the wings, where there is clear evidence of fire damage on the metal.</p> <p>In addition, investigators are eager to recover and test pieces of the underbelly of the plane&#39;s midsection, which they believe is located in the debris site closest to Kennedy Airport. The small pieces in that area are believed to be the first pieces blown from the airplane.</p> <p>The focus on the inside of the plane&#39;s cabin has come as investigators have eliminated other possible locations for a bomb. They have already said they do not believe a bomb was in the cockpit area because when they pulled the cockpit out of the water a week ago, they found that the glass covers for most of the pilot&#39;s gauges were unbroken. At the same time, they discovered to their surprise that the glass ceiling light over the stairway to the jumbo jet&#39;s upper level was intact, making it unlikely that a bomb had exploded near there.</p> <p>The forward cargo hold of a Boeing 747 -- large enough to hold a car parked sideways -- can carry as many as 16 luggage containers, seven or eight on either side. But this flight was only about half-full, and so the hold contained only four. They were situated in the front of the hold, and no other cargo was in the hold, investigators said.</p> <p>The rear cargo hold is believed to have contained only cargo, not luggage. But because the plane&#39;s forward section split from the rest of the fuselage and fell into the ocean first, investigators said they strongly believed that an explosion occurred somewhere near the front of the plane, forward of the wings.</p> <p>As early as the middle part of last week, several key investigators began having doubts that a bomb had been hidden in luggage in the cargo hold because of the condition of the other three aluminum baggage bins, which had been recovered early last week.</p> <p>Two of the containers were badly damaged, and the third was relatively intact. But bomb experts looking at those containers did not find any residue or damage consistent with a bomb, investigators said.</p> <p>Safety board investigators said they also remain interested in the center wing fuel tank, a large space between the wings. It was mostly empty when the plane took off, but aviation experts said it still held enough fuel to explode, if the fuel got warm enough to turn into a vapor and something ignited it.</p> <p>The wreckage shows that the center-wing fuel tank had extensive fire damage, as would be expected no matter what caused the initial blast. But because divers have pulled up only a portion of the tank, they are not ready to draw conclusions.</p> <p>Also today, Robert T. Francis, the safety board vice chairman who is in charge of the investigation, said two more bodies were recovered over the weekend, meaning that 198 of the 230 people on board have now been accounted for.</p> <p>The baggage containers, used to speed up the loading and unloading of the jumbo jets, are rectangular metal boxes with side doors or roll-up canvas sides. Baggage handlers say most of them are made of aluminum. Luggage is stacked inside the containers, which are rolled into the cargo hold and then secured in place. A manifest listing the contents is then stuck to the side of each container.</p> <p>Salvage workers have also recovered two engines and parts of a third. They believe the fourth is in the main debris area, under other parts, but they are reviewing sonar records from other areas to make sure they have not missed anything.</p> <p>Little wreckage was recovered today as the Navy gave nearly all of its personnel some extra time off. Most of them have been working 12 hours a day for weeks. Divers on the Grasp, a Navy ship moored over the main wreckage field, skipped the noon-to-midnight shift today. But they were due to resume operations early on Monday.</p> <p>Rear Adm. Edward K. Kristensen, the Navy officer in charge, also said the Navy had decided to send home the research vessel Diane G. but keep the ship&#39;s experimental laser-line scanning system on hand at the Shinnecock Inlet Coast Guard Station, in case it should be needed later. The laser system, he said, had been useful mostly for finding human remains because conventional sonar signals, good for finding metal, are not particularly useful for finding bodies.</p> <p>The system -- a box about the size of a refrigerator, with a sensor that is towed behind a ship -- could be installed on another ship if the searchers found another area where they thought it would be useful, he said.</p>
1558931>Program Promoting Car Safety for Children Will Focus on the Poor Most parents have gotten the message that children are safer in the back seat of the car, but parents with less income and education disproportionately have not, according to a new survey. In response, safety officials plan to announce on Wednesday a program to distribute safety information with the food vouchers given to mothers of young children under a federal program. In 2002, figures show, 324 children were killed in the front seats of cars. If those had been in the back seat, 100 would have survived, safety experts say, and thousands of others would have been hurt less severely or not at all if they had been in back.  <p>According to the federally sponsored Air Bag and Seat Belt Safety Campaign, foundations and companies in the automotive field, about 1,700 children&#39;s lives have been saved since 1996 because they were in the back seat.</p> <p>Researchers have long known that the rear seat is safer, but a public campaign to keep children 12 and younger off the front seat took hold in the 90&#39;s, when children were being killed by passenger-side air bags, often in fairly low-speed collisions.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Old air bag, new air bag, no air bag, kids are safer in a rear seat, properly restrained,&#39;&#39; Chuck Hurley, executive director of the campaign, said.</p> <p>The survey, by Public Opinion Strategies, questioned 800 adults of all ethnic backgrounds, and an additional sampling of 300 African-American adults and 363 Hispanics, all of whom said they transported children 12 and younger. The survey found that 6 percent of all adults said they put children 12 and younger in the front seat. Eleven percent of African-Americans and 7 percent of Hispanics said they did so. People with lower incomes and educations were also more likely to put children in the front seat.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;In almost every area of highway safety, risk patterns of low-income people tend to be higher,&#39;&#39; Mr. Hurley said.</p> <p>The group hopes to reach many of them through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or W.I.C.</p> <p>The campaign recommends that children 12 and younger sit in back. Infants should be in rear-facing safety seats until they are at least 12 months old and weigh at least 20 pounds. Children older than 12 months who weigh 20 to 40 pounds should ride in forward-facing seats. Those over 40 pounds should use boosters or other appropriate restraints until they are about 4 feet 9 inches tall and can use an adult lap-shoulder belt, the campaign said.</p>
607800>Regulator Says Connecticut&#39;s Largest Power Company Harassed Worker Northeast Utilities, Connecticut&#39;s largest power company, persecuted one of its engineers because he called a safety problem at a nuclear reactor to the company&#39;s attention, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said yesterday. Moreover, it said, Northeast delayed reporting the problem even though it could have affected the safety of other reactors around the country.  <p>The Federal commission said the violation of its rules was even worse because top officials of Northeast, including the company&#39;s chairman, were &quot;aware of it, but failed to act in an effective manner to correct the situation.&quot;</p> <p>It proposed a $100,000 fine and characterized the violation as being in the second most severe category; nationally, only three or four such violations are issued each year, and Northeast has not been cited that way since 1984. Retaliatory Actions</p> <p>&quot;We take whistle-blowers seriously, and we expect our licensees to take them seriously also,&quot; said Joseph Fouchard, the chief spokesman for the commission. The commission found, among other things, that managers at the utility, in retaliation, improperly sought to give the engineer, Paul M. Blanch, bad performance evaluations and initiated an audit of overtime and expense reports in the department he supervised.</p> <p>The company said it was working on a detailed rebuttal and would file it within the 30 days allowed under the commission&#39;s rules.</p> <p>Mr. Blanch, 51, who filed a complaint four years ago, said, &quot;I feel very vindicated.&quot; But he added: &quot;They agreed with me, but in the meantime I am unemployed. The action against Northeast and to protect me should have occurred within three months; why does it take four years?&quot; He had quit his job at Northeast in February, after 20 years.</p> <p>His next goal, Mr. Blanch said, is to get a job in which he could improve the quality of regulation of the nuclear industry. He is suing the company that makes the transmitters, Rosemount, of Eden Prairie, Minn., a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Corporation, contending that the company &quot;influenced Northeast to supress my uncovery of the defect.&quot; Further Study Pledged</p> <p>The chairman of the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control, Clifton A. Leonhardt, said he found the Federal report &quot;very troubling.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It suggests a violation of a basic compact that&#39;s involved in the operation of four nuclear plants within the borders of Connecticut,&quot; he said. His agency will study the report, he said, and decide whether it will take action beyond what the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has done.</p> <p>At Northeast, a spokesman, Anthony Castagno, said: &quot;Our position is that no employees or supervisors or managers did anything that violated regulations at all. We don&#39;t believe there was any harassment or intimidation.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Castagno said that the commission had investigated the company in 1990, after other workers complained of harassment, and that it had found the majority of employees felt comfortable raising safety concerns. Since then, he said, Northeast had established a phone number for employees to make anonymous calls, installed suggestion boxes and established a &quot;peer program&quot; under which employees could relay their concerns to workers at their level to be passed on to managers.  Helped Develop Solution</p> <p>But in its report yesterday, the commission said that &quot;various workers&quot; at Northeast said they would not raise safety issues with management, because of the way Mr. Blanch had been treated.</p> <p>Mr. Blanch discovered in the late 1980&#39;s that an electronic transmitter in use in one of Northeast&#39;s reactors -- as well as plants around the country -- tended to fail without giving any indication that it had done so. The result of the failure was to leave control-room instruments indicating a reassuring, but false, water level. Northeast adopted a solution that Mr. Blanch helped develop, a computer program that watches for a telltale lack of activity.</p> <p>When other utilities that use the equipment formed a joint research group on the issue, the commission said, Northeast and the manufacturer of the equipment blocked Mr. Blanch from becoming chairman of the joint group.</p> <p>The commission also faulted the company yesterday for failing to report promptly that in 1986 and 1987 5 of the 12 transmitters of the type Mr. Blanch had identified had failed. The failure file a prompt report is serious, the commission said, because the problem &quot;could involve the safety of other nuclear-power plants.&quot; But the commission did not propose a fine.</p>
1362580>Suicidal Nuclear Threat Is Seen at Weapons Plants Since the suicidal terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, some experts on nuclear security are increasingly concerned that intruders could break into American weapons plants, assemble a nuclear bomb from materials there and explode it on the spot. Critics of security procedures at Energy Department weapons plants  say intruders might use conventional explosives to blow up nuclear waste or uranium or plutonium, sending radioactive materials into areas nearby, or they might try to create an actual nuclear bomb.  <p>Building a high-yield nuclear weapon requires substantial skill with metal-working and explosives, but starting a chain reaction is relatively easy. Government bomb builders have accidentally done it several times over the years. With some training, terrorists might produce a chain reaction using uranium in a way that created a substantial explosion, some experts say.</p> <p>Ron Timm, a former Energy Department security official, said that in some cases assembling a bomb could be done without explosives, by bringing uranium parts together manually. &#39;&#39;Flying a 757, or a 767, is a lot more sophisticated than what we&#39;re discussing here,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Mr. Timm is a co-author of a report issued in October by the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group, that traces a history of security problems at the weapons plants.</p> <p>The report recommends consolidating nuclear materials now held at 10 sites and putting security for the materials under the direction of an independent oversight agency instead of the Department of Energy.</p> <p>A scientist not associated with the report, Frank N. von Hippel, who is a physicist and a professor of public and international affairs at Princeton, said in a telephone interview that a 100-pound mass of uranium dropped on a second 100-pound mass, from a height of about 6 feet, could produce a blast of 5 to 10 kilotons. The Hiroshima bomb, which used uranium, was 12 to 17 kilotons.</p> <p>Even a blast of only one kiloton, he said, would destroy an area of about one square mile. But finding the right amounts of uranium could still be a challenge, he said.</p> <p>Nuclear fuel is stored in a wide variety of buildings, and previous security reviews have found that some of it is vulnerable to theft.</p> <p>Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a longtime critic of the Energy Department, plans to raise the issue on Wednesday in a news conference where several current and former Energy Department workers will describe security lapses.</p> <p>In a letter to the energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, which Mr. Markey said he would send on Wednesday, he argues that suicidal terrorists could try &#39;&#39;rapidly propelling two masses of weapons-grade plutonium or uranium towards one another to create a critical mass,&#39;&#39; by using conventional explosives.</p> <p>That is how the Hiroshima bomb, was detonated, experts point out.</p> <p>Scientists said that a plutonium bomb could be built with a much smaller quantity of material than a uranium bomb, but that it would probably begin a chain reaction before the parts could be moved into  position, resulting in a nuclear blast that would not be very powerful.</p> <p>The first plutonium bombs, tested at the Trinity Site in New Mexico and then used at Nagasaki, had elaborate arrangements of explosives to squeeze the mass together and hold it there long enough for the chain reaction to become sufficiently established.</p> <p>Mr. Markey&#39;s letter cites cases in which nuclear weapons laboratories and manufacturing plants have failed security drills conducted by Navy Seals and other commandos playing the part of terrorists. For example, in a drill at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1997, the &#39;&#39;terrorists&#39;&#39; used a garden cart to steal enough weapons-grade uranium for numerous nuclear weapons,  a report cited by Mr. Markey says.</p> <p>But John A. Gordon, a retired Air Force general who is under secretary of energy for national security, expressed confidence in security.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;After Sept. 11, we&#39;ve put the folks on higher alert and they&#39;re working very aggressively,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;I think a D.O.E. weapons site is one of the last places a terrorist would think about attacking and having hopes of success; the security basically bristles.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>General Gordon said &#39;&#39;attackers&#39;&#39; sometimes prevailed in security drills because &#39;&#39;sometimes we run them to failure.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We want to find out where the system would break down, and we run stuff that is guaranteed to lose in the end,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;After each one of them, we strengthen security.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Energy Department has been concerned since at least 1991 about the possibility of terrorists using its materials to build a bomb on site, but Mr. Timm and others questioned whether suicidal terrorists were a likely threat.</p> <p>A NATION CHALLENGED: NUCLEAR SECURITY</p>
834904>Aging Hardware Means Increased Airline Delays The weather may be fine for flying and the plane may be ready and waiting, or even most of the way to its destination. But the flight may still be delayed because the country&#39;s air traffic control system has broken down. Key pieces of electronic hardware in the nation&#39;s control centers are approaching 30 years of age, reason enough for unreliability. But management miscalculations have made the situation worse. The Federal Aviation Administration has let its inventory of spare parts decline, along with its cadre of skilled technicians, because the old equipment was supposed to have been replaced by around 1990. But in fact, because of delays in acquisitions, crucial parts will have to last for years to come.  <p>And breakdowns may get worse before they get better, according to Monte Belger, the agency&#39;s associate administrator for air traffic services, because 30-year-old equipment will hardly be more reliable when it turns 31. The National Transportation Safety Board, an independent body, also predicted more trouble ahead, because parts break down so much that at any given time the backup equipment is out of service for 30 percent of the electronic gear, meaning that part of the system is one failure away from breakdown.</p> <p>For travelers there is hardly any way to avoid trouble. The oldest equipment is in the five busiest control centers: Chicago, Cleveland, Fort Worth, New York and Washington. These centers handle flights that originate or end in their areas, but also flights that are just passing through.</p> <p>Chicago and New York have an additional problem: the controller work force in those places is stretched thin, making it hard to cope with equipment failure.</p> <p>The system hardly ever shuts down completely, but it tends to lose features  that the air traffic controllers use to juggle more and more planes on their screens.</p> <p>For example, when everything is working right, a controller can push a button and a line will appear in front of each blip on the radar screen, showing where that plane will go in the next few minutes, based on a flight plan that the pilot filed before takeoff and the plane&#39;s speed and heading. If the lines cross or come too close together, the planes will come in conflict unless the controller orders one or both of them to change heading, altitude or speed.</p> <p>Controllers can still separate traffic safely when that feature disappears,  but it makes the job slightly harder.</p> <p>Another example: Normally, when an airplane reaches the border of one controller&#39;s sector and is about to pass into another, the controller uses a trackball to click on a certain spot, automatically alerting a controller in the adjacent sector that he is handing off the plane. In serious breakdowns, that point-and-click function is lost, and the controller has to talk to another controller, who may be in the same room or may be hundreds of miles away. That kind of failure sharply increases a controller&#39;s workload and reduces the amount of traffic that each controller can handle.</p> <p>Outside safety experts say there is little danger, mostly because the F.A.A. sharply limits the number of planes it allows in affected areas when equipment fails. The last time an air traffic control equipment failure was officially listed as a cause of a near miss was in 1989, during a breakdown at the Denver center. Other factors included heavy workload and a controller-trainee&#39;s misunderstanding of the situation in the air.</p> <p>Even if accidents are unlikely, delays are certain. Major failures have required hundreds of planes to wait for long periods, in holding patterns or at  airports.</p> <p>The number of delays depends on outside factors, like the overall traffic level and weather conditions. A breakdown in the middle of the night can pass with hardly any effect at all, but on a summer afternoon when traffic is heavy and thunderstorms are disrupting routes anyway, the effect can be widely felt.</p> <p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the controllers&#39; union, recently offered advice to travelers, especially those flying on high-traffic days: Take a book along.</p> <p>TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT&#39;S REPORT</p>
129703>Texaco Appears Close To Ending Bankruptcy Texaco appeared close yesterday to clearing away the remaining major obstacles to emerging from bankruptcy.  <p>The company announced that it had reached an agreement on a procedure for settling a $6.5 billion Federal tax claim and lawyers said a dispute involving shareholder suits was near a resolution.</p> <p>A Federal bankruptcy court hearing is scheduled to begin Tuesday in White Plains in which a judge will hear objections to the reorganization plan. Interest in the mammoth case is so large that the hearing will be held in the ballroom of a hotel near the court.</p> <p>Texaco shares closed up $1 yesterday, at $45.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p> <p>Shareholders have filed 15 suits on behalf of the company against Texaco&#39;s top executives for mishandling Texaco&#39;s 1984 merger with the Getty Oil Company. That deal broke up a merger arrangement between Getty and the Pennzoil Company. After Pennzoil was outbid by Texaco, Pennzoil sued, arguing that Texaco had illegally interfered with a completed deal.</p> <p>Pennzoil was awarded $10.3 billion by a jury in Houston. Unable to post a bond required for the appeal, Texaco entered bankruptcy. Texaco and Pennzoil later agreed to a $3 billion settlement, to be paid on Texaco&#39;s emergence from bankruptcy.  Plan to Extinguish Suits</p> <p>The reorganization plan, if approved by the judge, would extinguish the shareholder suits. Its provisions also bar Texaco from suing the entities that sold it the largest blocks of Getty stock, the Sarah Getty Trust and the J. Paul Getty Museum, which, Pennzoil maintained, had earlier agreed to sell their shares to Pennzoil.</p> <p>According to other lawyers in the case, the lawyers for the shareholders will apply to the court for payment of their fees, which Texaco will not oppose. But the dollar amount of the bill has not been established, and other details are still open.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s not a done deal,&#39;&#39; said one of the lawyers, &#39;&#39;it&#39;s not even a 90 percent done deal.&#39;&#39; But he confirmed the outlines of the agreement.</p> <p>Texaco announced late yesterday that it had entered into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service that would permit negotiations to continue with the I.R.S. after the company emerges from bankruptcy. Under the agreement, Texaco plans to deposit $1 billion over four years in an account bearing no interest, beginning with $200 million on April 14, the day it plans to emerge from bankruptcy. Four other equal payments would be made on each anniversary of the first payment.</p> <p>Texaco also promised to maintain a net worth of at least $7 billion, and agreed to other financial limits, including restrictions on its ability to make payments to shareholders.</p> <p>According to Wilbur L. Ross Jr. an adviser to the equity committee, this provision would eliminate the possibility of a leveraged buyout of the company by limiting the amount of the debt the company could incur.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The I.R.S. has determined that, based upon the term of the agreement and its review of Texaco&#39;s financial information, the company will be able to pay the tax claims as and when they are finally resolved,&#39;&#39; the company said. &#39;&#39;The agreement is neither a settlement nor an admission of liability for tax claims on Texaco&#39;s part, but rather establishes a process under which tax claims against the company can be resolved.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The I.R.S. claim results from a two-tiered oil-pricing system imposed by Saudi Arabia on Texaco and three other oil companies, the Exxon Corporation, the Chevron Corporation and the Mobil Corporation, from 1979 to 1981. Under the system, the Saudis sold oil to the four companies at $28 a barrel when the market price was $34, and ordered the companies to sell the oil to their subsidiaries at the lower price. The I.R.S. asserted that the difference between what the companies charged and the world oil price was taxable income.</p> <p>Even if Texaco successfully emerges from bankruptcy, its corporate troubles are not over. Carl C. Icahn, the head of Trans World Airlines who owns 14.8 percent of Texaco&#39;s shares, is pressing for a drastic restructuring of the company and T. Boone Pickens, the head of Mesa Petroleum, has announced that he intends to take a major position in the company.</p>
1542588>Mars Mission&#39;s Invisible Enemy: Radiation As the United States considers new goals for NASA after the loss of the Columbia, some space enthusiasts have renewed calls for a mission to Mars. But a team of physicists and biologists here at a laboratory on Long Island is demonstrating that even if the nation wanted to commit to such a goal, it would be far more complex than the Moon mission that gripped the country in the 60&#39;s.  <p>One reason is radiation, in the form of heavy ions from distant stars, zipping through everything in their path. Others include price, estimated at $30 billion to $60 billion, and launching enough food, supplies and fuel for a round trip. Any one of these could make the project impractical.</p> <p>In a new $34 million NASA laboratory here, part of Brookhaven National Laboratory, scientists are using subatomic particles accelerated to nearly the speed of light to slam into materials that could be used in a spaceship, and tissue samples and small animals. Using tools like PET and M.R.I. scans and DNA sequencing, they hope to shed light on ways that radiation damages biological tissue, and what can be done about it.</p> <p>On a trip to Mars and back, probably every cell in the body would be hit by an ionized particle or a proton, researchers say, and they have very little idea what that would do. &#39;&#39;If every neuron in your brain gets hit, do you come back being a blithering idiot, or not?&#39;&#39; asked Dr. Derek I. Lowenstein, the chairman of Brookhaven&#39;s collider accelerator department.</p> <p>A trip to Mars means &#39;&#39;trying to live in an environment that human beings were not built to live in,&#39;&#39; Dr. Lowenstein said. &#39;&#39;Space is not &#39;Star Trek,&#39; but the public certainly doesn&#39;t understand that.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>On earth, radiation shielding is easy; just add concrete or lead. That is not so easy on a spaceship, where weight is of the essence. Nor is there much prospect of significantly reducing the amount of time the astronauts would be exposed, unless NASA develops a much more effective propulsion system.</p> <p>The NASA administrator, Sean O&#39;Keefe, has identified radiation as one of three problems that will have to be solved before a Mars mission. The others are better propulsion and on-board power generation.</p> <p>Brookhaven is studying the radiation in a a sprinkling of undistinguished-looking corrugated metal buildings, connected by low earthen berms. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s where the action is,&#39;&#39; said Mona Rowe, a spokeswoman. The berms are shields for tracks underneath that carry the accelerated particles that slammed into targets or one another. Above the berms, wild turkeys amble through the woods.</p> <p>The radiation environment that the accelerator is mimicking is vastly different from the terrestrial one.</p> <p>The average American receives about 350 millirem of radiation a year: the fraction of solar and cosmic radiation that makes it through Earth&#39;s magnetic field and atmosphere; radiation from naturally radioactive rocks and minerals, some incorporated into building materials; higher doses from flying in airplanes; and sources like medical X-rays.</p> <p>In contrast, the astronauts who went to the Moon on Apollo 14 accumulated about 1,140 millirem, equivalent of about three years on Earth in their nine-day mission. The astronauts on the Skylab 4, who spent 87 days in low Earth orbit, received a dose of about 17,800 millirem (equivalent to a 50-year background dose on Earth).</p> <p>That dose was near the threshold of radiation exposure that produces clinically measurable symptoms. Longer-term effects like increases in cancer rates have not been observed in adults exposed to doses at that level, but experts presume the effects exist. By comparison, nuclear power plant workers are limited by law to exposures no greater than 5,000 millirem a year; in this country they are generally held below 2,000.</p> <p>A round trip to Mars would be of a different order of magnitude. Brookhaven puts the exposure at 130,000 millirem over two and a half years. That is equivalent to almost 400 years of natural exposure.</p> <p>But radiation in space is not like radiation on Earth.</p> <p>On Earth the dose is mostly made up of gamma rays, which have far less energy than the heavy charged particles of space. But beyond Earth&#39;s protective atmosphere and magnetic field, the radiation is mostly ions of every element on the periodic table up to iron (No. 26), moving at a substantial fraction of the speed of light, and approaching from distant stars in all directions. Astronauts in low Earth orbit get some protection from the magnetic field.</p> <p>Much less is known about the biological effects of this radiation, because very few places can simulate the interplanetary radiation. Brookhaven can do it, but its method, sequentially firing ions of different elements, resembles playing a symphony by mimicking one instrument at a time.</p> <p>One recent afternoon, scientists were adjusting the flow of iron ions being delivered to the 400-square-foot &#39;&#39;target room&#39;&#39; of the laboratory here, using a control a bit like a shower head, which could vary the dimensions and density of the spray. The target would eventually be a flask filled with human tissue, but for now was a monitoring instrument that captured an image the way an X-ray film would.</p> <p>Dr. Adam Rusek, a physicist, shuttled between a control panel and the main room of the Space Radiation Laboratory, where Dr. Betsy Sutherland, a staff biologist and some assistants, were watching instruments that analyzed the beam.</p> <p>Intermittently, an assistant went into the heavily shielded target room to adjust the target, a procedure that requires a retina scan by a security device and the insertion of special keys to assure that no one unauthorized enters.</p> <p>Inside the room, the lighting dimmed before each initiation of the beam, so that anyone trapped inside could hit a panic switch to stop it.</p> <p>At last, the beam assumed the desired size, density and uniformity. &#39;&#39;Is that better?&#39;&#39; Dr. Rusek asked. &#39;&#39;Yes, don&#39;t breathe on it,&#39;&#39; Dr. Sutherland replied.</p> <p>One persistent question about radiation exposure is the importance of the delivery rate, but Dr. Sutherland is simply trying to hit each cell once. &#39;&#39;If a cell is hit once, there is no rate,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;Once is once.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>After irradiation, the cells are moved to a nutrient medium that is known to support cancer cells but not normal cells.</p> <p>The experiment is repeated with ions of several elements. Dr. Sutherland also uses protons, which come from the Sun and stars and far outnumber the ions.</p> <p>One theory holds that cells busy repairing damage from protons will not be able to cope with damage from heavy ions; another says that proton irradiation will prime the cell&#39;s repair system to be ready for particle damage.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s a reasonable thing to ask, what are these first protons going to do to the later response to iron,&#39;&#39; said Dr. Sutherland, noting that the theory had not been tested.</p> <p>Another Brookhaven scientist, Dr. Marcelo Vazquez, a physician, plans to irradiate mice to look for brain damage. Damage from heavy ions, he said, will include a column of cells formed by the track of the ion, and a surrounding halo of cells damaged by electrons.</p> <p>Dr. Vazquez, who also has a doctorate in neurobiology and radiobiology, said that neither the column nor the penumbra was visible on post-mortem examination. But changes in motor skills are tested by stimulating animals with cocaine and measuring movement with infrared beams, Dr. Vazquez said. Memory can be observed. Mice are put in water and trained to escape to a platform; then they are irradiated and the drill is run again.</p> <p>NASA&#39;s chief scientist, John M. Grunsfeld, who as an astronaut made several spacewalks to maintain the Hubble telescope, said the research would take years. &#39;&#39;The current plan is about five years but I suspect we&#39;ll extend that,&#39;&#39; he said in an interview in Washington. He hopes that the research reveals the biological mechanism of radiation damage to cells, he added.</p> <p>Also, some targets are structural materials. The incoming protons and ions have so much energy that they make neutrons peel off the aluminum or other materials; those neutrons are a potent form of radiation. In addition, irradiating some materials can cause changes that make them radioactive. Such &#39;&#39;activation products,&#39;&#39; commonly produced in nuclear reactors on Earth, give off yet more radiation. Researchers hope they can pick materials that will resist such activation or neutron peeling.</p> <p>A third area of research is shielding. On Earth, radiation shielding is commonly provided by concrete or lead, but the costs of launching spacecraft are so high that this is not practical. One possible solution is a water tank, with the astronauts&#39; living in a chamber in the middle. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s just so expensive to put material into orbit that you&#39;d like to use materials you have to bring anyway,&#39;&#39; Dr. Lowenstein said.</p> <p>And beyond the spaceship itself, making space safe for extended trips beyond the magnetosphere will probably require a new system to monitor the Sun.</p> <p>Physicists predict solar storms now by watching the Sun from Earth or from satellites in Earth orbit, but protecting a Mars mission will probably require watching the side of the Sun that faces away from Earth. The job could be done with a small number of satellites launched into orbit around the Sun, somewhere outside the orbit of Mercury, Dr. Lowenstein.</p>
478764>A-PLANT TO CLOSE OVER SAFETY ISSUE The Yankee Rowe nuclear reactorin Massachusetts, the nation&#39;s oldest nuclear power plant, began closing yesterday, a few hours after the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said its confidence in the complex&#39;s safety had been reduced. The regulators very seldom close an operating plant. The last time it happened was in March 1987, when Federal inspectors found operators asleep in the control room at the Peach Bottom plant in Pennsylvania.  <p>In this instance, the staff had planned to present its findings to the regulatory commission this morning, but a plant spokesman, William McGee, said that under the circumstances, &quot;it seemed like the prudent thing to do for us to voluntarily initiate the shutdown&quot; rather than wait for a vote.  Vow to Keep Rowe Closed</p> <p>Operators said they hoped to win permission to re-open the plant soon. But critics of Yankee Rowe who have been fighting for months to close the plant for precisely the reasons cited yesterday in the commission staff&#39;s findings said they would try to keep it closed.</p> <p>The plant, situated a mile south of the Vermont border and 35 miles east of Albany, supplies about 1 percent of New England&#39;s electric power, so the closing will not affect supply or price. But the move is a blow to the nuclear industry and the Department of Energy, which had selected Rowe and another plant to be first in line to apply for renewal of their 40-year operating licenses.</p> <p>Rowe&#39;s operators had intended to apply for renewal last month under a procedure laid out by the commission last summer, but the plant abandoned that schedule as it became embroiled in a furor over its safety and on whether it should be closed immediately as a hazard.</p> <p>Attention was focused on Rowe&#39;s safety in June, when a nuclear watchdog group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, petitioned the commission to shut down the plant because of uncertainty about the condition of the reactor pressure vessel. The vessel, a 33-foot-high steel pot that is 10 feet in diameter and 8 inches thick, holds the fuel and the water used to cool the fuel and carry away the heat so it can be used to make electricity. Radiation makes the vessel more brittle every year.</p> <p>Until yesterday, the commission&#39;s staff had agreed with Rowe&#39;s operators that the plant could be safely operated until March, when the owners, a coalition of New England utilities, planned to close it for its most detailed inspection since the plant began operation in 1960. After the staff&#39;s assurance, the four commissioners voted in August to let the plant keep running, but they called for more information from the plant and told their own staff to keep them informed.  Defeat for Critics</p> <p>At the time, the watchdog group took the vote as a defeat for its position that Rowe should be closed because its safety could not be guaranteed.</p> <p>In August the commission&#39;s staff said the plant should be permitted to operate until March since its assessment on the problem with the reactor pressure vessel included many worst-case assumptions and that the chance of an accident that would test the brittleness of the vessel was about 1 in 1,000.</p> <p>Yesterday, the chief of the commission&#39;s staff sent a memorandum to the commissioners saying that new computer simulations cast additional doubt on the vessel&#39;s safety.</p> <p>The problem, which experts say could become increasingly common among the nation&#39;s aging reactors, is whether the vessel is so brittle that during an accident it would crack like a glass jar.</p> <p>If a pipe breaks anywhere in the cooling system, the emergency core cooling system is supposed to force cold water into the vessel to prevent overheating, all the time maintaining pressure, to keep the cooling water from boiling away. But cooling the metal while keeping it under pressure could create a condition called &quot;pressurized thermal shock,&quot; in which any flaw in the metal could turn into a catastrophic crack, according to the commission staff. Until the vessel is inspected, engineers must assume there is a flaw.</p> <p>As analyzed by Yankee Rowe engineers, in the worst case, a small pipe would rupture and the cooling system would add a relatively small amount of water, without much mixing in the vessel. In that case, the cold water would be concentrated in one part of the vessel, chilling the metal there and making it prone to crack. The biggest risk, according to the engineers, would be the break of a pipe with a diameter of 1 and 5/16th inches.</p> <p>Nuclear plants are designed to withstand multiple equipment failures and the rupture of their largest pipes, but not the failure of a reactor vessel.  Question of Assumptions</p> <p>John D. Haseltine, the project manager at Rowe for demonstrating the safety of the vessel, said the commission engineers were using slightly different assumptions about the reactor than were plant engineers. Some of the same assumptions used by the commission staff and by the plant engineers in their separate calculations are &quot;conservative&quot; rather than &quot;realistic,&quot; he said, and by making the assumptions more realistic, he hoped to persuade the commission that the plant is safe.</p> <p>Engineers at Rowe had proposed heating the water that would be used in an emergency and making sure that if the emergency core cooling system became activated the pumps that usually circulate the cooling water would continue to operate. But those pumps are not certified as able to work in an emergency; for example, critics say, their wiring has never been tested to determine if it would withstand the steam and radiation that would be present in an accident. The memorandum to the commissioners yesterday said that the staff could not estimate with confidence the reliabiltiy of pump operation.</p> <p>While the plant&#39;s owners said the plant would remain closed until the commission gave permission to re-open, they added that they hoped to obtain that permission without the detailed inspection that had previously been scheduled for March. They said they were hoping to persuade regulators that existing data demonstrated an acceptably low risk.</p> <p>At the plant, some opponents were ambivalent about the closing.</p> <p>&quot;I think the N.R.C. staff recommendation that it be closed down is good news,&quot; said Gail Steinbring, a member of an activist group, Citizens Awareness Network, that held weekly meetings on the plant over the summer. &quot;But in reality we&#39;ve been living with a risk far greater than we were aware of.&quot;</p> <p>The debate over the reactor vessel has engendered severe mistrust. Three members of the citizens group said yesterday that closing the plant was good but that they were concerned about extra emissions of radiation caused by the shutdown. In raising this unusual concern, none of the three could describe how such releases would occur.</p> <p>Robert Pollard, reactor safety specialist for the Union of Concerned Scientists and a former member of the commission&#39;s staff, said, &quot;On the one hand, I&#39;m encouraged with the staff having gone out on a limb, saying &#39;Oops, we made a mistake.&#39; On the other hand, if the commission hadn&#39;t intervened in our petition, the staff would have done nothing.&quot;</p> <p>It cost cost $40 million to build Yankee Rowe, a large figure in 1960 but paltry as against that of more recent plants, which have cost 100 times as much.</p> <p>Yankee Rowe is 37 percent owned by Northeast Utilities, 30 percent by New England Electric System, 10 percent by the Boston Edison Company, and the rest by other utilities. It has about 200 employees.</p>
852362>F.A.A. Cites Problems With Airline and Oversight The Federal Aviation Administration said today that Valujet airlines had been beset by safety problems in the weeks before the Florida Everglades crash on Saturday and that in investigating those problems the agency had discovered deep flaws in its own monitoring of the airline. While maintaining that the airline is safe and that the F.A.A. acted appropriately as it learned more of Valujet&#39;s flaws, the agency released internal reports today showing that F.A.A. managers were concerned about their ability to monitor the airline.  <p>Some critical surveillance activities did not receive much attention,&quot; said a report by the agency&#39;s Flight Standards Office last Feb. 14.</p> <p>The agency&#39;s increased scrutiny of Valujet since Flight 592 crashed into the  Everglades last week, killing all 110 people aboard, prompted the carrier to cancel half its daily flights today. Valujet officials said that the company&#39;s 51 planes would remain in service but that it would cut its daily flights to 160, from about 320.</p> <p>&quot;The measures we are announcing today go well beyond the current F.A.A. inspection to reassure our customers that we share their insistence on the utmost safety,&quot; Lewis Jordan, Valujet&#39;s president, said in a statement.</p> <p>The F.A.A. report in February, which was made after a string of problems with Valujet planes prompted the agency to take a closer look, found fault with both  the regulated and the regulator. Despite the fact that Valujet&#39;s fleet consisted almost entirely of old planes, the F.A.A. made no structural inspections of the planes for two years, according to the Feb. 14 report, which  said that this area had been &quot;severely overlooked.&quot;</p> <p>Inspections of the airline&#39;s manuals and procedures were also neglected, as were inspections of things like mechanical shops, the report said. Inspecting manuals is important to assure that they are appropriate; for example, the F.A.A. found that at one point Valujet was training DC-9 crews with manuals meant for other airplanes.</p> <p>The report said that the airline, which is based in Atlanta, lacked &quot;adequate policies and procedures for the maintenance personnel to follow&quot; and also lacked data on engine trends. It recommended that the F.A.A. consider &quot;recertification  of this airline.&quot;</p> <p>Explaining that term this afternoon, Anthony J. Broderick, the Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification at the F.A.A., said it meant determining, step-by-step, that the airline was in compliance, a process that he said was under way.</p> <p>Mr. Broderick also said that the job of checking on the performance of Valujet&#39;s pilots in the cockpit would be taken over directly by F.A.A. inspectors, beginning next week. These proficiency checks are usually carried out by the airline, using employees who have been qualified for that job by the  F.A.A.</p> <p>At a news conference that became testy at times, Mr. Broderick was asked repeatedly why his agency never simply grounded Valujet, after a variety of incidents in which aircraft were damaged, sometimes with minor injuries to passengers or crew members. He said Valujet&#39;s problems never demonstrated &quot;systemic safety violations.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;In large airlines and large companies, you will find individual pockets of noncompliance,&quot; he said. But he added, &quot;We judge people in a binary fashion: either you do meet our standards or you don&#39;t.&quot; And Valujet, he said, does.</p> <p>&quot;If they do not meet the standards at any time in the future, we will not let them fly,&quot; Mr. Broderick said.</p> <p>But he also sought to demonstrate, by reciting a chronology of Valujet&#39;s problems and the F.A.A.&#39;s responses, that the agency had been, at every step, appropriately concerned and active.</p> <p>Among the steps taken was the preparation of a second report, by the Atlanta  inspectors&#39; office, that found an increased number of unfavorable reports on maintenance and &quot;a significant decrease in experience level of new pilots being  hired by Valujet as well as other positions such as mechanics, dispatchers, etc.&quot;</p> <p>It also found &quot;continuous changes of key management personnel.&quot;</p> <p>And there was a third report, an analysis of the rate of accidents of low-cost carriers per 100,000 departures, compared with the rate for major, higher-cost carriers. A draft of that third report, dated May 2, was obtained by The Chicago Tribune, which on Thursday published an article based on it. Later that day, the F.A.A. released what it said was a final version of that report and asserted that, contrary to the assessment of The Tribune, the figures did not show major differences between the two groups of airlines.</p> <p>But that study did cast Valujet in an unfavorable light.</p> <p>The report said that for each 100,000 departures, Valujet had 2.537 serious accidents (all accidents, minus those resulting from turbulence, other &quot;minor accidents in flight&quot; and mishaps at the gate or on the ramp). In comparison, 12  low-cost airlines had zero: Amerijet, Air South, American Trans Air, Carnival, Frontier, Kiwi, Morris, Reno, Spirit, Vanguard, Western Pacific and Southwest. Only one other low-cost airline studied had had a serious accident, Tower, with  a rate of 8.680.</p> <p>Among nine major carriers, which are far larger and thus less likely to achieve a rate of zero, the average rate was 0.76. The data went back to 1990.</p> <p>Also, of any of the 23 airlines studied, Valujet had the second-highest level of pilot deviations -- cases in which a pilot strayed too far from an assigned altitude or route through the sky -- and the highest rate of runway incursions,  in which a plane was on the wrong spot on the ground.</p> <p>In a statement written as a preface to the report and released on Thursday, the F.A.A. said that &quot;because of the significantly smaller volumes of departures by low-cost carriers, a single accident could lower an airline from the best record in the survey to the worst.&quot;</p> <p>The figures for low-cost airlines are also distorted by the relative sizes of the companies. Measured by flights, Southwest Airlines accounts for 80 percent of the group&#39;s business, and it had no serious accidents and a low rate of minor accidents.</p> <p>For all 14 low-cost carriers, including Southwest, the total accident rate was 0.418 per 100,000 departures, vs. 0.3 for the &quot;higher cost&quot; companies, which were Alaska, America West, American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, TWA, United  and USAir.</p> <p>The rate of serious accidents was 0.12 for the low-cost carriers and 0.08 for the major airlines. That means that a low-cost airline was 50 percent more likely to have a serious accident than a major airline. The F.A.A. said that the report had found &quot;little difference&quot; in relevant statistics.</p> <p>The difference was far larger if Southwest was excluded from the low-cost group; the other low-cost carriers had an accident rate of 1.204 per 100,000 departures, four times the rate of the major carriers.</p> <p>The report did find that the low-cost carriers did better than the major airlines in one measure of safety, pilot deviations. For the low-cost carriers the rate was 1.86; for the majors it was 2.66.</p> <p>Mr. Jordan, the president of Valujet, said in a news conference this evening  that the company had hired a &quot;safety czar,&quot; a retired four-star Air Force general, James B. Davis. General Davis will have full authority over all aspects of safety, he said.</p> <p>The F.A.A. has been urging all airlines to hire a top-level safety official for about 18 months.</p>
229211>No Clear Winners or Losers Emerging Yet in Lilco Pact If the Shoreham nuclear power plant is abandoned under the agreement announced Tuesday by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, will the Long Island Lighting Company&#39;s one million customers be getting a better deal than if the reactor had operated? And what about the shareholders?  <p>The questions may come into sharper focus today when the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission is to take a vote that could clear the way for the licensing of Shoreham. Lilco has said it will pursue a license until the agreement is ratified by all parties.</p> <p>State analysts and the company are reluctant to portray any party as a clear winner or loser. Outside observers will have a hard time doing that, too. Answering the questions requires a room full of financial and energy analysts, a computer and a crystal ball.</p> <p>Tne answers depend, for example, on how reliable the plant would have been, how much the oil that would have been saved would have cost, and how many expensive new regulations would have come from the N.R.C.</p> <p>It is also impossible to pick winners and losers because the agreement does not guarantee rate increases. The State Public Service Commission will have to determine increases by April 15 and they must pass muster with the Lilco board and shareholders. Rate Increases Inevitable</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There are no numbers out there&#39;&#39; yet for the actual costs with or without Shoreham, Joseph W. McDonnell, a spokesman for the company, said.</p> <p>It is obvious, however, that large rate increases are coming, whether the plant runs or not. It is also obvious that the parties to the agreement are relying on the benefits of a treaty ending years of strife to solve some of Lilco&#39;s problems.</p> <p>For example, with a schedule of guaranteed rate increases, Lilco could re-enter the credit markets and refinance its $3.7 billion in long-term debt, some of which is now at rates of 17.5 percent. With the ability to attract capital at lower rates, Lilco&#39;s profit margin could be reduced.</p> <p>A breakdown of the $5.5 billion cost of the Shoreham plant does give some clue about what it would cost customers to operate it. And an agreement last June that the Legislature refused to approve but which is the basis of this week&#39;s agreement provides a rough idea of what Long Islanders and shareholders would see on their bills.</p> <p>The June agreement called for annual rate increases of 5 percent for 10 years. But since then, to settle a racketeering case, Lilco has agreed to forgo $400 million in income. The new agreement is expected to bring a decade of annual rate increases of 4.3 to 4.6 percent. The Traditional Way</p> <p>In contrast, if the plant were to open, the traditional system would be to add its cost to Lilco&#39;s &#39;&#39;rate base,&#39;&#39; its investment in plant and equipment. The rate base is the dollar amount on which the utility is allowed to earn a rate of return, or profit. The Public Service Commission currently allows Lilco to earn 14.2 percent on its equity.</p> <p>In addition, everything in the rate base is assumed to wear out, or depreciate. The company is reimbursed for depreciation through rates.</p> <p>But in Shoreham&#39;s case, the Public Service Commission found that $1.4 billion of the $5.5 billion construction cost was spent imprudently and thus could not be put in the rate base. (The amount is now under review because of a court challenge.) That leaves about $4.1 billion.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, the $4.1 billion could not be put in the rate base before the plant operated. But the Public Service Commission has bent its rules to keep the company from going bankrupt. It has already allowed Lilco to act as if $2 billion were in the rate base.</p> <p>Assuming that the rate increase was calculated in the traditional fashion, all in the year that the plant went into service, the rate increase would be about $322 million, or 18 percent. But running the plant would cost about $65 million a year in operating and maintenance expenses, $72 million in property taxes and - even though construction is complete - about $65 million a year in new capital expenditures. With these costs, the rate increase would be about 27 percent. Uranium Would Cost Less</p> <p>On the other hand, running the plant would mean switching the company&#39;s fuel source from expensive oil to cheap uranium. That would reduce the size of the rate increases by 2 to 3 percentage points.</p> <p>In practice, even if Shoreham began operations, its cost would be phased in. And the cost of Shoreham would not be the only impetus for rate increases; Lilco&#39;s labor costs will rise, and fuel costs will probably do the same. In all, according to the calculations by the Public Service Commission staff, the other elements would add another 47 percent to the approxiately 25 percent increase for Shoreham, for a total rate increase of 72 percent over 10 years.</p> <p>But if Shoreham were abandoned, an increase of only 60 to 62 percent would be needed, the commission&#39;s staff believes. Among the reasons are that property taxes on the plant would be phased out and there would be no operating and maintenance expense or additional capital expenses. Cheaper in First Decade</p> <p>While the state calculates that retiring Shoreham would be cheaper for customers in the first 10 years, it does not make that claim for the plant&#39;s expected lifetime of 40 years. That calculation relies more heavily on the price of oil and the reactor&#39;s reliability.</p> <p>Whatever the rates turn out to be under the proposed settlement, the abandonment plan builds in a number of savings. It calls for Lilco to write off $90 million for a failed uranium venture. It also calls for a $234 million write-down on Shoreham itself and $23 million for another abandoned reactor, Jamesport. The total is $357 million, equivalent to $3 a share.</p> <p>The agreement outlined last June also called for a delayed return to the payment of dividends on common stock, although it is intended to return the company to financial health eventually. Tomorrow, it will be five years since Lilco paid a common dividend.</p> <p>But the company would begin earning a rate of return and depreciation on the bulk of its Shoreham investment. Without the settlement, its prospects for doing so are uncertain, depending on action by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and subsequent court challenges, among other variables.</p> <p>Mr. McDonnell said that in &#39;&#39;doing it this way, the company is in a weak financial condition, in terms of the normal financial ratios one would apply.&#39;&#39; But, he added, &#39;&#39;what investors are looking for is a sure, steady return to financial health,&#39;&#39; which the financial package will probably provide.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;In 10 years,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;you look like a normal utility.&#39;&#39;</p>
1751713>Automakers Use New Technology To Beef Up Muscle, Not Mileage John Elsden relishes the excitement of the mint-condition &#39;65 Mustang convertible he takes out of his garage in eastern Virginia only on sunny days. The sporty coupe with a 289-cubic-inch engine growls, rumbles, vibrates and shakes when he puts his foot on the gas pedal. But the Mustang, Mr. Elsden said, is not as zippy as his daughter&#39;s year-old sports wagon, a Nissan Murano, and accelerates hardly better than his wife&#39;s 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Mr. Elsden, a car buff who has owned a variety of muscle cars, said the average sedan today accelerated faster than many cars designed to turn heads in the old days.  <p>For two decades automakers have been developing technology that could make vehicles go farther on a gallon of gasoline. But instead, they have chosen pep and size -- making vehicles like the new Murano accelerate faster than cars like the old Mustang, and making them bigger.</p> <p>The average vehicle, which 25 years ago accelerated to 60 miles an hour in 14.4 seconds, now does it in 9.9 seconds, a pace once typical only of sporty or luxury cars like Camaros and Jaguars. And vehicle weight now averages about 4,100 pounds, up from about 3,200 in the early 1980&#39;s, as many buyers switched to larger, roomier cars or to sport utility vehicles and minivans, and as automakers added safety equipment.</p> <p>Buyers like the extra zoom and room, but these have come at a cost: average fuel economy has fallen slightly over the last two decades. The government&#39;s new standards for light trucks like S.U.V.&#39;s, published yesterday, will require an 8.1 percent increase in miles per gallon over the four model years from 2008 through 2011. [Page C1.]</p> <p>But over the longer term, significant improvement appears to be lagging. As scientists and engineers look for ways to satisfy the fast-growing demand for energy and to slow climate change, many of them say that fundamental changes are needed in the way fuel is produced and consumed.</p> <p>They say that ways must be found to replace oil and gas, and to get more energy from coal, which will become increasingly important as an energy source, without adding to carbon dioxide emissions.</p> <p>And they say that greater fuel efficiency is imperative as the number of motor vehicles, which the Worldwatch Institute says has nearly doubled worldwide in the last two decades, could double again in 15 years. The United States has the highest per capita gasoline consumption of any major country.</p> <p>Higher mileage would also significantly reduce emissions of global-warming gases that come from burning gasoline. The increase in vehicle acceleration and weight alone has raised emissions of carbon dioxide in the United States by about 5 percent.</p> <p>If 2005 model vehicles, with their better technology, had the performance and size of those in 1987, they would use only 80 percent of the gasoline they do today, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That alone would get the country nearly halfway to the goal President Bush set in his State of the Union address: to cut American oil consumption enough to nearly eliminate the need to import from the Middle East.</p> <p>But because Americans have not insisted on better fuel economy, &#39;&#39;we can take the technology in the cars and turn the knob toward performance,&#39;&#39; said Karl H. Hellman, an automotive development expert who retired from the E.P.A. two years ago.</p> <p>Improving mileage now would be easy if drivers sacrificed some zip in new cars, he said, &#39;&#39;but in this country, we don&#39;t sacrifice for anything.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Just as significant as vehicle weight is how much faster autos accelerate, even as more driving is done on congested roads. The E.P.A. does not calculate how much of the poorer fuel economy results from acceleration and how much is attributable to weight, but it publishes figures suggesting that the split is about even.</p> <p>The 2005 Toyota Camry, one of the most popular sedans, accelerates more quickly than some 1975 Pontiac Firebirds. The Chevrolet TrailBlazer, an S.U.V., can reach 60 miles an hour in 8.2 seconds -- about half the time of its 1985 ancestor. The 2006 Cadillac STS-V, which can reach 60 m.p.h. in less than five seconds, is one of many cars that now have more than enough horsepower to pull an 18-wheeler.</p> <p>Philip H. Kosak of High Point, N.C., owns a 1965 Mustang, a 2005 Mustang, a Chevrolet TrailBlazer S.U.V. and an extended-cab Silverado pickup. The whole country, himself included, is spoiled, he said.</p> <p>He has thought about buying something smaller and more fuel-efficient, especially with gasoline prices often running near $3 a gallon, but he has driven a pickup for years. &#39;&#39;Once you&#39;ve graduated to that, it&#39;s tough to go back. It&#39;s like moving back into a smaller home.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Kosak, who owns a company that produces snack food, said he drove 30,000 miles a year. He could save hundreds of gallons of gas a year with something smaller, he said, but even at today&#39;s fuel prices he can afford the extra expense and does not want to give up the fun of something that performs well. Mr. Kosak, who is 50, says he is looking forward to a lot of driving just for enjoyment.</p> <p>But nearly a hundred million households burning an extra few hundred gallons a year add significantly to pollution and a greater reliance on imported oil. That contributes to a larger trade deficit and, at times, the use of American power to protect foreign supplies.</p> <p>Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York, who has pushed for years for higher fuel economy standards, said, &#39;&#39;We can talk all we want about our addiction to oil, but words have to be followed with deeds.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It wouldn&#39;t be a sacrifice at all. No one really needs that greater power, except specialized vehicles for law enforcement purposes.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The carmakers say they give customers what they want. &#39;&#39;Performance and safety, those factors are salable into the marketplace,&#39;&#39; said Gerald M. Roussel, manager for energy and environment at the Ford Motor Company&#39;s government relations office. And they have done so while reducing emissions of pollutants that cause smog and acid rain, he and others pointed out.</p> <p>In improving fuel economy, virtually everyone agrees that there is a way only if there is a will. &#39;&#39;There is no shortage of technology,&#39;&#39; said John M. DeCicco, a senior analyst at Environmental Defense, a nonprofit advocacy group.</p> <p>Technologies already in use include four valves for each cylinder, which allows more power from a smaller, lighter engine, and computer-controlled fuel injection, which increases efficiency and cuts pollution.</p> <p>More changes are coming. For example, gas-electric hybrids are increasingly common, but have been used in some cases more to make the vehicle accelerate faster than to go farther on a gallon of gasoline.</p> <p>Indeed, Mark P. Mills, a physicist and energy expert, said that improvements in vehicle efficiency would not reduce consumption because without a significant rise in gasoline prices to encourage buyers to save fuel, most people would simply take advantage of the advances to demand bigger, faster vehicles.</p> <p>Mr. DeCicco agreed. &#39;&#39;What we&#39;re really talking about here is the need to, through a combination of public policy and awareness, use the technologies at hand with a different set of priorities in mind,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Until we do that, all the invention in the world isn&#39;t going to make a difference.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Energy Challenge</p> <p>Articles in this series will periodically examine the ways in which the world is, and is not, moving toward a more energyefficient, environmentally benign future.</p>
339055>Con Ed Wants to Stifle Demand Consolidated Edison, which like other utilities has historically earned its profits by building generating stations and selling customers more electricity, is now moving instead to insure that it will not have to build another power plant for many years.  <p>In advertisements in newspapers and trade journals, the company recently asked for bids to help it meet 200 megawatts of demand, about 2 percent of its current capacity, through a combination of new generating stations and cutting demand. At the same time, the company, which serves 2.9 million electric customers in New York City and Westchester County, is expanding an experimental program to help big customers use less energy by paying them to buy more efficient lights and motors.</p> <p>More Aggressive</p> <p>While Con Edison began stressing conservation in 1971, the company is becoming more aggressive about it because it is being pushed by a conservation-minded New York Public Service Commission. In addition, company executives recall their financial problems from Con Edison&#39;s last big construction project, Indian Point, in Buchanan, N.Y., in the mid-1970&#39;s. The company could not raise the money to finish the Indian Point 3 reactor, as well as a much smaller oil- and gas-fired generator in Astoria, Queens, because of financial problems related to the rise in fuel prices and accounting changes.</p> <p>The company omitted two quarterly dividends in 1974, and had to be bailed out by the New York Power Authority, which bought the unfinished reactor and the Queens plant at cost, and opened them soon thereafter.</p> <p>The experience left the company wary of exposing itself to more risk. This time, rather than building a major plant, the company hopes to cut the growth in demand in half by &#39;&#39;buying conservation,&#39;&#39; and meet the other half by contracting with independent power producers, avoiding the need for a new plant of its own until at least 2010.</p> <p>The company&#39;s efforts to sell less of its product are not the most advanced in the country, but they are of broad interest because Con Edison&#39;s rates are among the highest. If the conservation measures Con Edison tries in lighting and electric motors do not work, they would seem unlikely to be successful anywhere. In Con Edison&#39;s service area, each kilowatt-hour saved represents 13.6 cents for a residential customer and 10.8 cents for an industrial customer; the national average price is around 8 cents for residential customers and 5 cents for industrial customers.</p> <p>The company&#39;s location is another special inducement for conservation. Con Edison will find it very difficult to build locally and will probably face opposition to building anywhere in the surrounding area. And it cannot buy additional energy from neighboring utilities because it is at the center of a region generally short of power.</p> <p>Conservation will not come free; the company has budgeted $39.4 million for subsidies, education and other activities in the current year and will probably spend more in years to come. But &#39;&#39;just putting off the need to build new plants is sufficient incentive,&#39;&#39; Eugene R. McGrath, the president and chief operating officer, said in an interview.</p> <p>His company has been accumulating land near the village of Red Hook, N.Y., about 85 miles north of Manhattan, on which to build a big power plant. But in the current environmental and technical climate - when nuclear power is not an option, coal is suspect and natural gas can be burned just as efficiently in smaller plants - the company is in no hurry to build.</p> <p>An Unusual Period</p> <p>The decision to avoid construction will extend an unusual period for the company, in which generating resources have been more than ample despite growing demand for electricity. Con Edison&#39;s newest big plant, Indian Point 2, is now 17 years old; the company built very little in the late 1970&#39;s and the 1980&#39;s, when other companies nearly bled to death because of overruns in the cost of nuclear plant construction.</p> <p>As a result, Con Edison had the highest annual return (dividends plus capital appreciation) of any utility in the country between 1979 and 1989 -25.7 percent, according to Duff &amp; Phelps, the Chicago-based debt-rating and financial analysis company.</p> <p>In the 1960&#39;s and 1970&#39;s, spurred by projections of rapid growth in its service territory, Con Edison feverishly added capacity. But demand stopped growing after the energy shocks of 1973 and 1979, leaving the company with a capacity surplus of 40 percent.</p> <p>Consumers paid the bill for the plants whether or not they ran. But the surplus has declined to about 20 percent. In the brutal heat wave of 1988, the figure fell to 17.2 percent.</p> <p>Close to the Margin</p> <p>For New York utilities, the optimum level has been set at 18 percent - a utility always needs a margin to handle scheduled maintenance and unexpected breakdowns. Living close to the margin, Con Edison no longer regards its projected load growth of about 1.3 percent a year as desirable.</p> <p>The program to preserve the company&#39;s generating margin is particularly focused on saving electricity on hot summer afternoons. Thus the company expects to spend $9 million this year in subsidies to encourage the owners of large buildings to run their air-conditioning systems on steam or gas, both of which Con Edison also sells and which are in surplus in hot weather.</p> <p>The company provides gas to one million customers and in Manhattan south of 96th Street, supplies about 2,000 with steam from electricity production. But its electric revenues dwarf the other services: $4.2 billion in 1988, compared with $614.8 million for gas and $271.4 million for steam.</p> <p>Con Edison will also help customers install equipment in their buildings that makes vast amounts of ice at midnight, when electric generators would otherwise be idle. The following day, the ice is used to cool water or air which is then piped into offices.</p> <p>Idea From California</p> <p>And with a technique established in California, Con Edison is looking for customers willing to shut down on a half-hour&#39;s notice, in exchange for an annual payment of $60 for every kilowatt of demand that is cut.</p> <p>Sixty-five customers have signed on, reducing demand by 20 megawatts, or 20,000 kilowatts, the size of a small power plant and about 2 percent of the production from a nuclear plant; the company hopes to double the program this summer.</p> <p>The customers range from hospitals that can run on emergency generators to small manufacturing plants that can reschedule production.</p> <p>For commercial customers, beginning this year, Con Edison will take steps like paying the extra cost of high-efficiency equipment.</p> <p>The company also offers free advice to architects on energy efficiency and will subsidize the added cost of buildings that use less power. But last year the builders of only five structures signed up.</p> <p>Checkbook in Hand</p> <p>Even with checkbook in hand, the company has met with mixed success in offering New Yorkers help to use less energy. Because it could not find enough takers, the company last year underspent its conservation budget by $11 million, or one-third.</p> <p>For residential customers, the company has a $6 million a year education program reminding people to take steps like weatherstripping their houses and turning off appliances when they are not needed.</p> <p>Con Edison does not help residential customers pay the extra cost for more efficient window air-conditioners or refrigerators because, the company believes, offering a subsidy merely encourages the consumer to buy a bigger model with a bigger appetite for power.</p> <p>Together, Con Edison&#39;s conservation steps produce a result similar to the addition of a power plant, according to company officials. But the cost is about $270 a kilowatt of capacity, which is less than a tenth the cost of recent nuclear plants.</p> <p>Commitment Questioned</p> <p>Con Edison&#39;s conservation expenditures this year come to about eight-tenths of a percent of its electric revenues, said Charles Komanoff, an energy consultant based in New York. &#39;&#39;Others are committed to doing much more,&#39;&#39; he said. For example, the $30 million a year spent by the Wisconsin Energy Corporation is about 2.4 percent of electric revenues and Pacific Gas and Electric in San Francisco spends about twice as large a percentage as Con Edison.</p> <p>Mr. Komanoff, who is often hired as an expert witness by utility critics in rate cases, said other utilities tend to put the money to better use, in subsidies for hardware that saves energy.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;At Con Ed, a lot of it is informational, and informational stuff tends to have a lower bang for the buck,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Mr. McGrath cites different obstacles. The average Con Edison residential customer, he said, uses about 3,900 kilowatt-hours a year, less than half the national average, leaving less room for conservation. Many customers are apartment-dwellers and a substantial percentage of them live in buildings with a single meter, so they have no incentive to save.</p>
1773264>William A. Shurcliff, 97, Dies; Helped Develop Atomic Bomb William A. Shurcliff, a physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb and went on to play an outspoken role in defeating plans for a supersonic passenger plane in the 1960&#39;s and the Star Wars antimissile defense system in the 80&#39;s, died June 20 in Cambridge, Mass. He was 97. The cause was complications of pneumonia, said a granddaughter, Elizabeth Shurcliff.  <p>At the time of his death, Dr. Shurcliff was working on a new method of insulating houses against summer heat, Ms. Shurcliff said. He had written a dozen books on solar power.</p> <p>Dr. Shurcliff, who earned a B.A. from Harvard in 1930 and a Ph.D. in 1934, was called to Washington in 1942 to work as a senior technical aide for the Manhattan Project and was later promoted to head of the Technical Intelligence Group. He was later co-editor of The Smythe Report, the official history of the development of the bomb.</p> <p>In July 1946, as a government historian, Dr. Shurcliff witnessed the detonation of two 23-kiloton bombs at Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;He said that even from 15 miles away, it was so blindingly bright that they were advised to cover their eyes, and even with his eyes covered, it was just blinding,&#39;&#39; his son Arthur said about the first blast. It was followed by an underwater detonation and a mushroom cloud.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I think after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he was almost horrified at what he had helped do,&#39;&#39; Arthur Shurcliff said. &#39;&#39;In a sense, the rest of his life was a sort of atonement.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Dr. Shurcliff returned to Cambridge to head an optics laboratory at the Polaroid Corporation, a company run by his classmate Edwin H. Land, and his inventions led to about 20 patents, Arthur Shurcliff said.</p> <p>In 1967, while working as the senior research associate at the Cambridge Electron Accelerator, a laboratory run by Harvard and M.I.T., Dr. Shurcliff founded a group called the Citizens&#39; League Against the Sonic Boom and began a nationwide campaign against the American effort to build a supersonic transport plane to match the British-French Concorde. &#39;&#39;We all believe in progress,&#39;&#39; he told The Harvard Crimson, &#39;&#39;but some things just aren&#39;t progress.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>He published a book, &#39;&#39;SST and Sonic Boom Handbook,&#39;&#39; and predicted that the plane would be obsolete before it could be built. Congress ultimately agreed.</p> <p>In 1986, he took on the Strategic Defense Initiative, a missile-based system of defense proposed by President Ronald Reagan that came to be known as Star Wars. He surveyed members of the National Academy of Sciences on whether they thought that interception of ballistic missiles could keep the country safe.</p> <p>In 1938, he surveyed fellow physicists to determine if they favored barring German scientists from American laboratories, to convey disapproval of the Nazi government.</p> <p>In his later years, Dr. Shurcliff became an expert on solar heating, publishing books including &#39;&#39;Solar Heating: One Hundred Daring Schemes Tried and Untried,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Air-to-Air Heat Exchangers for Houses&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Thermal Shutters and Shades: Over 100 Schemes for Reducing Heat Loss Through Windows.&#39;&#39; In 1978, he published a survey of 120 solar-heated buildings in North America.</p> <p>Besides his son Arthur, of Cambridge, and his granddaughter Elizabeth, of Montreal, Dr. Shurcliff is survived by his wife of 65 years, Joan Hopkinson Shurcliff; another son, Charles, of Ipswich, Mass., and a second grandchild, Margaret of Twin Oaks, Va.</p> <p>An active commentator on technology trends, Dr. Shurcliff, in a July 2002 letter to The New York Times, responded to an article about three-dimensional systems for televisions and computers.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I was at the center of the technology of the 1950&#39;s 3-D craze,&#39;&#39; he recalled of his years at Polaroid. In theaters, he wrote, &#39;&#39;it turned out that the audience loved the feeling of being right in the room with the action,&#39;&#39; if the movie was pleasant.</p> <p>But he added: &#39;&#39;Especially for TV viewing, 3-D may have little merit and may even spoil the atmosphere. Your home is not a place for strangers, including dislikable and vicious ones, to seemingly enter and take over.&#39;&#39;</p>
1343322>Oil Drilling in Arctic Called Departure From Past Policy If Congress approves drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, it will be breaking with government practice of the last 35 years, which has limited when drilling may occur in refuges, the General Accounting Office has concluded. Oil wells are not uncommon in wildlife refuges around the country, and proponents of drilling have argued that if energy is extracted from refuges elsewhere, it can be done in Alaska, too.  <p>In a report requested by an opponent of such drilling, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of  Massachusetts, the accounting office  found that about 13 percent of the refuges, in 21 states, had some kind of oil and gas activity last year.</p> <p>But the office, the investigative and auditing arm of Congress, also found that since the passage of the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, in 1966, the only leases that the government has signed for oil and gas exploration were where drillers on adjacent private land were extracting fuel from under the refuges.</p> <p>In most of the others, the petroleum development preceded the creation of the refuge, or private companies already owned the mineral rights in the refuge.</p> <p>Opponents of drilling have generally argued that the Alaska refuge is a unique, fragile treasure that should not be threatened by an oil spill, or even by the infringement of industrial development. Mr. Markey raised an additional point, that drilling in the refuge would set a bad precedent.</p> <p>Proponents of drilling, he said, &#39;&#39;very disingenuously argue that many refuges allow for drilling.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;What they don&#39;t mention is that none of that permission has been granted since 1966,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;and that if the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge was made an exception, it would become a Trojan horse that could be used to permit drilling in the 297 other refuges that have been identified by the United States Geological Survey as having oil and gas potential.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In January, in The Wall Street Journal, Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana argued that there had been oil and gas production from  refuges there for nearly 60 years, with 1,605 wells. &#39;&#39;If Louisiana can do it, why can&#39;t Alaska?&#39;&#39; Mr. Breaux, a Democrat, wrote. The wells and pipelines, he said, are on &#39;&#39;fragile wetlands&#39;&#39; that are home to a variety of wildlife. He said there had been &#39;&#39;few adverse consequences.&#39;&#39;</p>
305756>Disputed Nuclear Nominee Gets Lower Post Faced with strong opposition in the Senate, the Bush Administration gave a second-level appointment yesterday to a nuclear expert whom it had nominated to take charge of the nation&#39;s nuclear bomb complex.  <p>The nominee, Victor Stello Jr., was named Principal Deputy Assistant for Defense Programs while his nomination as Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs lingers before the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p> <p>Despite a highly unusual personal appeal to the committee by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, the panel left Mr. Stello&#39;s five-month-old nomination to the higher post in limbo last week when it adjourned until Jan. 22 without acting on it. The lesser job does not require Senate confirmation.</p> <p>At Mr. Stello&#39;s confirmation hearings, several Senators raised questions about his actions in his previous job, as the chief staff official of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has jurisdiction over civilian reactors. Charges Against Nominee</p> <p>In that role, Mr. Stello was accused of altering agency regulations at the request of utilities that operate reactors, to the detriment of safety, and authorizing unusual cash payments to an informant as part of a vendetta within his own agency. The chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, complained at the confirmation hearing earlier this month that the committee was still awaiting information from the Justice Department on a grand jury investigation of Mr. Stello in the mid-1980&#39;s.</p> <p>A spokesman for the department, Philip D. Kief, said the new appointment yesterday was taken &#39;&#39;to keep him here so he can work.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Since Mr. Stello was nominated five months ago, he has been on loan from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Mr. Kief said this temporary status deprived him of full authority.</p> <p>High-ranking officials at the department had speculated that Mr. Stello would withdraw his name if the Senate did not act.</p> <p>In a memorandum sent yesterday afternoon to managers of the nation&#39;s nuclear bomb program, Under Secretary of Energy John C. Tuck said the new appointment was made to &#39;&#39;enable Defense Programs to more readily meet the wide range of demands facing the nuclear weapons complex.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Many of the plants in the nuclear weapons production system are shut down for safety reasons and two are under investigation for possible felony violations of pollution laws.</p> <p>As Mr. Stello&#39;s confirmation was delayed, Mr. Tuck was earlier given on an acting basis the job to which Mr. Stello has been nominated.</p> <p>That action was taken, according to the department, to dramatize the need for Senate action. According to Mr. Kief, Mr. Tuck could be given that job, in addition to his own, because he is already a Presidential appointee with Senate confirmation.</p> <p>In his new job, Mr. Stello will be the leader of six deputies, until the Senate acts. Mr. Tuck said in his memorandum yesterday that &#39;&#39;it is my expectation that the Senate will complete action on his nomination shortly after it reconvenes in January.&#39;&#39;</p>
53822>Towns Near Boston See Incinerator as Solution While the rest of the country tries to cope with a shortage of landfill space, officials north of Boston grow happier and happier with their solution: an incinerator that cuts trash volume by 90 percent without violating state pollution standards.  <p>The commercial plant, which disposes of most of the trash from 20 towns with a combined population of more than 600,000, also produces electricity, which is now the plant&#39;s primary revenue source.</p> <p>Waste disposal experts say that each American produces about 850 pounds of trash each year, an amount that is producing mountains in communities nationwide. The experience here in Saugus offers one way to stretch the space remaining in landfills.</p> <p>The incinerator opened in 1975, the first commercial one in this country using a garbage-to-energy technology that is common in Europe, burning trash to boil water for electricity. At Start, Begging for Garbage</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We had to go out and beg for garbage when we started,&#39;&#39; said H. Bruce Manning, the general manager. &#39;&#39;Now we&#39;re at capacity.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The average fee paid by the towns to the plant&#39;s operator, Signal Environmental Systems, is $22 a ton. Landfills in the region that have not yet been filled or closed for environmental reasons charge up to $100 a ton.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They took a technology and made it work,&#39;&#39; said Bruce K. Maillet, director of the air quality control office of the Massachusetts Division of Environmental Quality Engineering.</p> <p>He said recent tests had shown that concentrations of dioxins and furans, suspected carcinogens, are under the state&#39;s guideline of 1.1 picograms per cubic meter of air. A picogram is a trillionth of a gram. &#39;&#39;We basically have satisfied ourselves that there is no public health hazard,&#39;&#39; Mr. Maillet said. But, he added, newer plants are built with &#39;&#39;acid scrubber&#39;&#39; systems to remove acidity, equipment his department would like to see installed.</p> <p>The plant&#39;s smokestack filters capture 99 percent of the particulates, according to Mr. Manning. On a scale in which black smoke would equal 100 and clear would be zero, the plant is well below the state standard of 20, he said.</p> <p>There are 67 similar plants operating in this country and five more in Canada, another 30 under construction, and 35 in the advanced planning stages, according to a survey last year by the United States Conference of Mayors.</p> <p>As garbage trucks bearing the names of a score of communities come and go every few moments, a bulldozer at Saugus pushes the trash deep into a loading area and a crane descends and lifts it. The garbage is loaded into one of two giant boilers. The temperatures reach 2,500 to 3,000 degrees, high enough to destroy nearly all the harmful compounds, plant operators say.</p> <p>Saugus is called a &#39;&#39;resource recovery&#39;&#39; plant because the fire&#39;s heat is used to make steam for electricity. The steam goes to a turbine-generator, which makes 37 megawatts of power, about one-twentieth the size of a reactor like Indian Point, in Buchanan, N.Y. #60% of Plant&#39;s Revenue Saugus uses about 3 megawatts to run the fans, crane and other equipment. The rest is sold to the Massachusetts Electric Company. The price is tied by Federal law to the price the utility would have had to pay for oil, coal and other fuels. It is now about 7.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, yielding over 60 percent of the plant&#39;s total revenue.</p> <p>The plant must still bury its ash, but Mr. Maillet said, &#39;&#39;They are landfilling a more stable material, and taking less space to do it.&#39;&#39; The ash is less prone to contaminate water supplies, he said, and does not decompose to produce methane as rotting garbage does.</p>
386064>Curbing U.S. Oil Appetite: Why It&#39;s So Hard Oil, like ice cream or french fries, is something Americans enjoy but would be better off consuming less of. But it is also very hard to get away from, for engineering reasons as well as historical and economic ones.  <p>The biggest obstacle is that no other fuel holds so much energy in such a small, light package, least of all the readily available substitutes of coal or electricity. What is more, 80 years into the automobile era, everything is built around gasoline, an investment of billions in refineries, tanker trucks and gasoline stations.</p> <p>And even at the modestly elevated price now, few of the alternatives approach being economically competitive with oil. That is particularly important because many Americans have come to feel almost as if they have a constitutional right to low-priced gasoline and do not see much point in paying higher taxes or higher prices for substitutes.</p> <p>The addiction to oil is worse for the United States than for any other country. The American economy is the biggest and its thirst for oil the greatest. And per capita oil consumption in the United States is more than double that of France, Britain and Japan.</p> <p>The main reason for the difference is the automobile. Of the 17.3 million barrels of oil used each day last year, 10.9 million, or 62.7 percent, went into transportation, most of it for gasoline. In a recent study, Lee Schipper, an energy analyst at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, calculated that Americans used about 350 gallons of gasoline per person in 1987, compared with 150 gallons in West Germany.</p> <p>Higher fuel efficiency would help; if the average American car were as fuel-efficient as the average German car, American consumption would have been about 75 gallons lower, he calculated. But about another 75 gallons of difference resulted because Americans travel more miles. Still another reason for greater gasoline use is that this country has more cars per 1,000 population. Americans traveled more than 11,000 miles by car that year, on average, while West Germans drove 5,000 miles. Americans, in a bigger country, tend to drive farther to work and play.</p> <p>Drawbacks of Other Fuels</p> <p>Candidates for a new transportation fuel abound, but they all have strong disadvantages.</p> <p>Foremost are the technical reasons. No fuel, natural or synthetic, carries so much energy around in such a small package. A gallon of gasoline, which weighs about 7 pounds, has as much energy as 11 pounds of coal, and coal, as a solid, is more difficult to handle. Coal can yield a liquid fuel, methanol, but that has only about half the energy of gasoline per gallon. (Also working against this solution is that more than conventional gasoline, methanol from coal introduces gases that are thought to promote climate change. Also, burning methanol from any source produces formaldehyde and other pollutants.) A pound of natural gas will take a car about as far as a pound of gasoline, but the natural gas takes up much more space: The energy in one gallon of gasoline would require, at atmospheric pressure, a container of gas in a cube nearly 5 feet on each side. The natural gas can be squeezed into a far smaller volume, but that requires a very heavy tank.</p> <p>And the amount of natural gas needed would be vast. For households that heat the structure, cook and heat water with natural gas, for example, converting the family car to natural gas would more than double their energy demand. If millions of vehicles were converted, more wells would have to be drilled and many more transmission pipelines built.</p> <p>As for electricity, it is abundant because it can be made from coal, but the space problem is even worse than for natural gas. If the amount of energy stored in 12 gallons of gasoline were instead stored in lead-acid batteries like the ones typically used for cranking and ignition in cars, the battery would weigh nearly a ton and a half, about as much as a small car.</p> <p>Historical Momentum</p> <p>Providing nearly 100 billion gallons of gasoline a year has created a momentum that would be difficult for any competing fuel to overcome. &#39;&#39;It takes mucho, mucho billions, not only to develop and produce a fuel, but to produce an infrastructure,&#39;&#39; said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates of Cambridge, Mass. &#39;&#39;Gasoline won the struggle for automotive fuel at the turn of the century, and everything has been invested in that ever since.&#39;&#39; Mr. Yergin said that gasoline was once viewed as a useless byproduct of kerosene, which was used for home heating, and was therefore readily available when cars first appeared.</p> <p>Cars at the turn of the century ran on everything from electricity to &#39;&#39;town gas,&#39;&#39; which was produced by heating coal at central stations, mostly for lighting streets and homes and for cooking. A variety of petroleum products including naphtha were also tried. Some Stanley Steamers ran on kerosene.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;At the very beginning of the auto industry, they didn&#39;t know what cars were going to run on,&#39;&#39; said James A. Wren, the chairman of the Society of Automotive Engineers history group. Alcohol was so popular, he said, that in France grape growers feared there would be nothing left for drinking.</p> <p>Mr. Wren traces the dominance of gasoline to nearly simultaneous developments: the Spindletop gusher, the large oil find in Texas that pushed oil prices below 5 cents a barrel, and Oldsmobile&#39;s open two-seater runabouts, called the Curved Dash Olds, which ran on gasoline. At that point, in 1901, &#39;&#39;you had a mass-produced car and a cheap fuel.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The range of options is larger now in a technological sense but not in an economic sense. Theodore Eck, the chief economist at Amoco, estimated that liquid vehicle fuel made from this country&#39;s most abundant hydrocarbon, coal, would not compete until oil prices reached $40 to $50 a barrel.</p> <p>Turning to Unconventional Oil</p> <p>Another possibility is ordinary gasoline made from abundant but unconventional oil, as from tar sands or shale, which generally requires mining rock and cooking it to make the oil come out. Chevron this spring estimated that such oils would be competitive with a world price of $25 to $40 a barrel in 1990 dollars. But while oil has jumped past $30 a barrel in recent weeks, oil executives say that because of the long lead times and heavy capital investments, it must be obvious to investors that the price will stay there. Today, that is like betting on Saddam Hussein&#39;s job tenure.</p> <p>Some fuels are available today at a price lower than gasoline&#39;s, but they entail other costs. A kilowatt-hour of electricity, for example, will propel a van about two miles, and the national average cost is about 8 cents, which is equivalent to gasoline at 80 cents a gallon in a 20-mile-per-gallon vehicle. And utilities say they could sell power for much less in off-peak hours, for drivers who charged their batteries at night. But because of the current state of battery technology, the vehicle itself would be uncompetitive.</p> <p>Other Costs Involved</p> <p>Some utilities will sell natural gas for vehicle use at a price equivalent to 70 cents a gallon of gasoline. But switching fuels means developing a vehicle engine that runs on something else, which could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and providing a network of fueling stations.</p> <p>Amoco, which recently began selling natural gas at two stations as an experiment, puts the cost of adding a natural gas pump at about $250,000 per station. With environmental regulations governing underground storage tanks, costs for other kinds of fuels would also be high. And the United States has about 200,000 places that sell gasoline; a substantial fraction of them would have to offer a different kind of fuel before most Americans would buy it.</p> <p>Mr. Eck at Amoco said that if Detroit would build cars that could switch from gasoline to natural gas, &#39;&#39;we could build the fueling stations a lot faster than they could build the cars.&#39;&#39; Sold in volume, he said, a car equipped to burn natural gas as well as gasoline would cost as little as $300 extra.</p> <p>But the auto makers show little enthusiasm for heavy new investments for a product for which the public is not clamoring.</p> <p>BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
1817469>Car Seats for Infants Often Fail In Broadside Crashes, Tests Find Car seats for infants often fail to withstand the impact when a vehicle is struck by another from the side, according to laboratory tests conducted by Consumer Reports. Of a dozen models tested in simulations of such impacts, 10 failed, some &#39;&#39;disastrously,&#39;&#39; the magazine reports in its February issue.  <p>The seats have a base that is installed in the car, and a detachable carrier in which the baby is strapped. In the simulations, the seats often separated from the base and skidded across the laboratory, Consumer Reports said.</p> <p>The seats are rear-facing models of the kind intended for infants up to 1 year old, or about 22 pounds. The government requires manufacturers to test such seats for head-on collisions, but not for broadside crashes, which kill about 30 infants a year in the United States.</p> <p>It is not clear from the tests how many of those deaths could be avoided with better seats: the magazine tested the seats at 38 miles an hour, the speed at which the government tests cars for protection of adults.</p> <p>Nicole R. Nason, administrator of the government&#39;s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the agency was working to develop its own infant-seat tests for broadside crashes. &#39;&#39;We need to move faster,&#39;&#39; Ms. Nason said, though adding, &#39;&#39;I do not want parents to be misled into thinking their children are safer in mommy&#39;s arms.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The magazine also found flaws in a much acclaimed system, required by the government in all new cars since 2002, that helps anchor baby seats to cars. Indeed, some child seats performed worse with this Latch hardware than when held in place by seat belts. The traffic safety agency said it would hold a public meeting next month to discuss how to improve the Latch system.</p> <p>One seat that failed the magazine&#39;s test was the Companion model made by Britax, a product that Consumer Reports, on the basis of frontal impact tests, had previously listed as top-rated. Britax, of Andover, England, sells a better seat in Europe, the magazine said.</p> <p>Another model, the Evenflo Discovery, even failed a head-on test, the magazine said, and should be recalled. But both the Evenflo Company and the traffic safety agency said the Discovery had passed the government&#39;s head-on test.</p> <p>Robert S. Matteucci, the chief executive of Evenflo, said in a telephone interview that Consumer Reports had so far refused to describe the test method it had used and that small changes in the test could invalidate the results.</p>
377073>Blockade of Iraq Raises Oil Prices Oil prices moved up more than $1 a barrel on world markets yesterday as traders reacted to the American blockade of Iraqi oil and the Saudi decision to turn away an Iraqi tanker that had sought to load at a pipeline terminus.  <p>Trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange ceased abruptly for the day shortly after 1 P.M. because power was cut off by a fire at a Consolidated Edison electric substation. The last quote recorded yesterday for West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude oil, for September delivery was $26.77, up 54 cents from the Friday close.</p> <p>The exchange said it was the first such disruption since trading of contracts for crude oil delivery began in 1983. The exchange set up special procedures yesterday to handle the absence of an official closing price, called a &#39;&#39;settlement&#39;&#39; price.</p> <p>Wide Spread in Cash Market</p> <p>But in the afternoon oil continued to move higher on the cash market, in which &#39;&#39;wet barrels&#39;&#39; as opposed to &#39;&#39;paper barrels&#39;&#39; are traded. Prices surpassed $27. Traders said the cash market showed an unusually wide spread between prices asked and prices bid, indicating uncertainty in the market.</p> <p>In addition, prices of Brent North Sea crude moved up on the International Petroleum Exchange in London, closing at $26.50, up $1.03.</p> <p>The rise in oil continued despite a midday news conference by the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, who said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would soon meet to consider ways to stabilize prices.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There is a lot of concern now that the blockade&#39;s in place, with people wondering where the extra oil is going to come from and whether there will be some shooting starting,&#39;&#39; said Peter C. Beutel, a trader at Merril Lynch Futures. &#39;&#39;The variables that are loose on this market are beyond imagination.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Saudi Move Is Cited</p> <p>At the Ashland Petroleum Company, based in Ashland, Ky., Ernie W. Stamper, administrative vice president, said the Saudi decision on Sunday to turn back an Iraqi tanker, Alqadisiyah, from the harbor at Yanbu, the terminal of the Iraqi pipeline across Saudi Arabia, was &#39;&#39;a potentially provocative act.&#39;&#39; In addition, he said, the embargo showed &#39;&#39;that sanctions are going to be effective, that there will be less leakage, maybe no leakage.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Either one of those would push the price up,&#39;&#39; Mr. Stamper said, adding, &#39;&#39;Nothing has happened to decrease tensions.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., predicted yesterday that the oil market would be &#39;&#39;a no man&#39;s land for the next few weeks until some action on the military and political front clarifies the situation.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Last Cargoes Are Due</p> <p>The market is watching for &#39;&#39;a military incident or accident, a coup d&#39;etat in Iraq, or a peaceful appeasement and solution&#39;&#39; to judge how long the embargo will continue. The last pre-embargoed cargoes of oil from Iraq and Kuwait will arrive in United States ports late this month or in early September, Cambridge pointed out.</p> <p>Gasoline for September delivery was trading on the exchange at 82.8 cents a gallon, up 3.35 cents, when trading was interrupted.</p> <p>While oil company traders followed the cash market instead of the futures market, the New York Mercantile Exchange announced that trading would open tomorrow &#39;&#39;no earlier than 11 A.M.&#39;&#39; Trading usually begins in phases, with crude oil opening at 9:45 A.M.</p> <p>The exchange said the settlement price for Tuesday would be used for Monday as well.</p> <p>The settlement price, an average of contract prices at the close of the market, is used to figure margin calls and is used as a reference point by many companies in the oil business in transactions made off the floor.</p>
779233>Rule Changes Are Coming For Truckers The rules that govern how many hours a truck driver may work were written in 1937, and the consensus of both the industry and its regulators is that it is time to change them. There are Interstate highways now, gears that shift more easily and suspensions that smooth the ride so that a driver&#39;s head no longer hits the cab ceiling with each bump. There are quiet cabs, air-conditioning and cruise control, all making it obvious that change is needed. But it is not so obvious what that change should be.  <p>Longer hours, the industry says, because driving is less work.</p> <p>Shorter hours, the National Transportation Safety Board says, because driving is soporific.</p> <p>The change may come next year, says the Federal Highway Administration, which sets the rules and is studying the issue. It began what was supposed to be a five-year study six years ago; the betting now is that the study will take at least seven.</p> <p>The agency&#39;s $4.5 million study was to test the driving environment and take account of 50 years of new knowledge about human sleep patterns. Researchers wired 500 drivers &quot;like Martians,&quot; said Stan Hamilton, an agency spokesman, to measure their hours of sleep and wakefulness and their level of performance.</p> <p>The results, when they are ready, may promptly lead to new rules, Mr. Hamilton said, if everyone involved agrees. &quot;But I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not going to happen,&quot; he added.</p> <p>The issue is important to everyone, according to the safety board, which said in a study in January that 750 to 1,500 people die every year in accidents in which the fatigue of truck drivers is a factor. The board&#39;s chairman, James Hall, said the research convinced him that truck drivers were simply not getting enough rest.</p> <p>The current rules for truck drivers call for 8 hours off after 10 hours of driving or 15 hours of work, which can include loading and unloading or other duties. But the hours off can be split into two segments, with the shorter being as little as two hours, and can be taken in a cab&#39;s sleeper berth.</p> <p>There is also a maximum number of hours per week: 60 if the company does not operate 7 days a week; or 70 hours in 8 consecutive days if the company operates 7 days a week.</p> <p>The safety board wants longer breaks and an end to the practice of splitting the breaks. With the advent of refrigerated trucks, it contends, there is less need to rush goods to market.</p> <p>Earlier this week the American Trucking Associations, which represents trucking companies, staked out its position. While the group believes it is too soon to make changes based on the safety board&#39;s research, it does want to ease the rules on a driver&#39;s working hours.</p> <p>In fact, drivers routinely violate the rules, Thomas J. Donohue, president of the associations, said on Tuesday at a news briefing in Washington.</p> <p>&quot;If you&#39;ve got a just-in-time delivery to Ford,&quot; Mr. Donohue said, &quot;and you&#39;re 35 minutes late because you&#39;ve been stuck in traffic, are you going to pull off the road and stay there for a day and a half, or are you going to deliver the damn thing? Reality, pragmatism, takes over.&quot;</p> <p>The company group offered its own logic: Even if drivers get more time between shifts, there will be no assurance that they will use it to sleep. And if they are barred from driving at night, when people naturally want to sleep, more trucks will be on the highways during the day, which will hardly increase safety.</p> <p>The group, citing statistics from the Transportation Department, noted that fatal accident rates for trucks were down 37 percent over the last 10 years, despite a major increase in mileage driven.</p> <p>There are various ways to improve safety, said David F. Dinges, a consultant to the industry who is also a biological psychologist of the University of Pennsylvania medical school. Among them, Mr. Dinges said, are continuous small doses of caffeine, new drugs to help drivers sleep during the day if they are assigned to drive at night, and lights in the cab to keep the driver alert.</p> <p>Another area for research, Mr. Donohue said, is equipment on a truck that could sense erratic driving and then give off an alarm that could &quot;wake the dead.&quot;</p> <p>The company group argues that more research is needed on two aspects of job fatigue: the tendency of people to fall asleep at certain times of day and the recovery of functionality after short rests.</p> <p>Both need to be addressed, the industry says, because various products, from milk to morning newspapers, must be moved at night to arrive at markets fresh in the morning; other products, like gasoline, are more safely moved at night.</p> <p>Trucks already travel 165 billion miles a year, Mr. Donohue said, and the industry predicts that amount will rise by 31 percent, to 220 billion miles, by the year 2003. &quot;We can&#39;t do that in 12 hours a day,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The industry also wants more highway rest areas. There are 28,000 fewer public rest area parking spots for trucks than are needed, the company group said, and sometimes sleeping drivers are wakened by the police after two hours and told to drive on, so another truck driver can stop to rest.</p>
209132>U.S. Hedges on Its Promise to Obey Court Decree in A-Plant Cleanup The Department of Energy yesterday backed away from a promise its officials hailed last month as precedent-setting: to submit to a Federal court&#39;s authority in cleaning up pollution at a uranium enrichment plant in Piketon, Ohio.  <p>Department officials said they would rather reach an out-of-court settlement than be bound by the Federal court. &#39;&#39;We feel a settlement agreement is a more flexible document,&#39;&#39; said Douglas G. Elmets, the department&#39;s press secretary.</p> <p>But in November, Ohio&#39;s Attorney General, Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr., said agreements not certified by a court were &#39;&#39;worthless&#39;&#39; because if the Federal Government failed to meet them, the state would have to go through extensive legal proceedings to enforce them. He reiterated that position in a telephone interview yesterday. Remaining Question</p> <p>Federal and state officials said the parties were near agreement on the technical steps required for a cleanup; the remaining question is how tightly the department will be bound to the agreement.</p> <p>In their announcement a month ago, Mr. Celebrezze and Gov. Richard F. Celeste said the state and the Energy Department&#39;s regional headquarters at Oak Ridge, Tenn., had agreed on a settlement of pollution violations. They said it would take the form of a consent decree, an agreement that has the force of law because it is approved by a Federal district judge. That announcement was confirmed by Energy Department officials.</p> <p>But yesterday an official at the Department of Energy said &#39;&#39;the General Counsel&#39;s office at headquarters switched the signals it was sending to the rest of the department&#39;&#39; about whether a consent decree was acceptable. He said officials in the department were now engaged in a spirited debate about whether to go along with a consent decree, and might still agree.</p> <p>The agreement concerned the Portsmouth Uranium Enrichment Complex, a six-square-mile plant in Piketon, where cancer-causing chemicals have contaminated the soil and underground water. Officials in Ohio said the consent decree was to have been the first such order in the nation. A consent decree was issued this month covering another Government nuclear site in Ohio, the Feed Materials Production Center at Fernald.</p> <p>About the Piketon cleanup, Mr. Elmets, the department press secretary, said in a telephone interview yesterday, &#39;&#39;The matter is still under consideration at headquarters&#39;&#39; and added, &#39;&#39;No final decision has been made.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>With a simple out-of-court settlement, he said, &#39;&#39;the parties can work out the problems without the intervention of the judiciary&#39;&#39; if circumstances require changes in the agreement. In view of this preference, it was not clear why the Energy Department had agreed to a consent decree in the Fernald case.</p> <p>On Nov. 22, when the Ohio officials announced the Piketon agreement, C. Anson Franklin, the department&#39;s chief spokesman and liaison with Capitol Hill, said simply, &#39;&#39;We have agreed to negotiate a consent decree.&#39;&#39; And Eugene W. Gillespie, the department&#39;s manager at the site, also confirmed the agreement, saying, &#39;&#39;We&#39;re breaking new ground here.&#39;&#39; &#39;We Had a Commitment&#39;</p> <p>In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Celebrezze said negotiations were continuing. &#39;&#39;We had a commitment from them,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;I expect the Energy Department to keep its word.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Asked whether Ohio officials had prematurely announced an agreement with the Oak Ridge office that might not have been approved in Washington, Mr. Celebrezze said: &#39;&#39;If you get into a game of who speaks for whom, the bureaucracy can run you around for the next five years.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;That&#39;s a very popular tactic for the Federal Government to use, when the person at the table says, &#39;Oops, I goofed.&#39; I think there was a very clear understanding.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The subject of the disputed agreement is a plant about 60 miles south of Columbus, owned by the Government and operated by the Martin Marietta Corporation, where gaseous uranium is enriched for use as fuel in nuclear power plants and submarine engines. It is vital to the operation of civilian reactors around the country, to nuclear submarines and to military reactors. Extensive Contamination</p> <p>The soil and underground water around the 34-year-old plant are extensively contaminated with such cancer-causing chemicals as trichloroethylene, a solvent, and PCB&#39;s, used in electric transformers.</p> <p>A survey of Energy Deparment nuclear operations in 12 states, made public this month, found the fourth most serious problem to be at the Piketon plant. It estimated that each day the cooling towers were releasing 30 to 40 pounds of chromium, a toxic and cancer-causing heavy metal, into the air.</p> <p>There is no evidence so far that the chemicals and radioactive materials have harmed employees or nearby residents.</p> <p>In describing the cleanup arrangement a month ago, the Energy Department, the state and environmentalists said it was the first time a Federal plant had been placed under state regulation and Federal and state environmental laws.</p> <p>Ohio officials estimated that the Government would have to spend $50 million to bring the plant into compliance with environmental laws.</p>
514435>Hertz Eases Surcharges In New York Responding to public anger, the Hertz Corporation announced yesterday that New York City residents who want to avoid surcharges can pay a $25 one-time fee for the company to check their driving and employment records to determine whether they are what Hertz is calling &quot;responsible renters.&quot; But Hertz said that it would keep its surcharges -- $56 a day for residents of the Bronx, $34 for Brooklyn residents, $15 for those who live in Queens and $3 for Manhattan -- because they appear to be achieving their purpose, scaring off renters who cause a disproportionate number of accidents and later suits against Hertz by people who are injured.  <p>Hertz said yesterday that in January and February, only about 20 of its cars were wrecked in the city, compared with about 90 in the same period last year. The number of accidents with less severe damage was down, but not as sharply, it said. Meanwhile, the number of rentals is roughly unchanged. Hertz will not know until next year whether suits are down also, because those usually lag the accidents by months, it said.</p> <p>Hertz, based in Park Ridge, N.J., has reported huge losses in payments to pedestrians, passengers and the drivers of other cars hit by cars rented from Hertz, under a New York law that makes the car owner liable. It attributes the problem mostly to people renting cars near their homes. Other car rental companies complain that local renters are more accident-prone than people traveling on vacation or business, but Hertz is the only one to take such an action. Avis, in contrast, is lobbying in Albany for a change in the liability law. &#39;A Burden on Residents&#39;</p> <p>Public officials who were asked for a reaction to Hertz&#39;s announcement yesterday were uniformly negative.</p> <p>Jeff Maclin, a spokesman for Mayor David N. Dinkins, said that applying for a safe driver certification &quot;still amounts to a burden on residents.&quot; Clint Roswell, a spokesman for the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, said: &quot;It&#39;s a smokescreen. Maybe it&#39;s easing somebody&#39;s conscience, but it&#39;s not really a responsible program.&quot;</p> <p>Daniel Andrews, a spokesman for Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, complained that Hertz was hurting mothers at home with young children, retired people and youths by limiting &quot;responsible drivers&quot; to working people.</p> <p>Hertz was slightly conciliatory yesterday. Joseph Russo, a spokesman, said the aim of the new program, which will start in 90 days, was to respond to &quot;the indignation of New Yorkers who are saying, &#39;Wait a minute, we&#39;re not all bad drivers.&#39; &quot;</p> <p>Potential renters would have to apply two weeks in advance, paying $25 and permitting Hertz to search their motor vehicle records. Applicants with no tickets in the last three years would qualify. Hertz will recheck the records intermittently, he said, and if someone later gets a speeding ticket, the qualification would be canceled.</p> <p>But the peace offering was immediately rejected by consumer advocates, including three members of the City Council who have sponsored a bill, scheduled for a vote today, that would outlaw discrimination in rental charges based on geography within the city. Sponsors of the bill said the Council would vote on it despite Hertz&#39;s action. And the city and state consumer agencies and the New York State Attorney General are still suing Hertz over the surcharges.</p> <p>&quot;We think this is a token effort that fails to address the issue of a discriminatory surcharge,&quot; said Ed Barbini, a spokesman for Attorney General Robert Abrams. He compared the requirement to imposing literacy tests on voters.</p> <p>Susan D. Alter, a City Councilwoman from Brooklyn and the chairwoman of the Council&#39;s consumer affairs committee, said of Hertz&#39;s new program, &quot;It&#39;s not enough.&quot; Hertz&#39;s policy is dividing the city, said Ms. Alter, who is one of three sponsors of the bill scheduled for a vote today. Bill Would Support Hertz</p> <p>Hertz officials said yesterday that the city law, if passed, would be unconstitutional, and that the company would sue to block its enforcement.</p> <p>State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican from Yonkers, said yesterday that he would introduce a bill to prevent the city from barring the Hertz surcharges. He said in a statement that if Hertz could not raise its prices in New York City it would do so all over New York State.</p> <p>Yesterday, State Senator Kemp Hannon introduced a bill that would limit the liability of car rental companies, for accidents involving their cars, to $100,000 a victim and $300,000 an accident. The bill is backed by Avis, based in Garden City, L.I., in Senator Hannon&#39;s district.</p> <p>Avis is lobbying hard for the bill, but Hertz is not, reasoning that it is unlikely to pass because of opposition by trial lawyers. New York is one of eight states that place no cap on liability.</p> <p>Hertz&#39;s announcement yesterday parallels a move by Alamo in January to require driving record checks for &quot;local&quot; renters at airports in 10 cities. Before it required the checks, it simply charged local renters more than renters arriving by plane. But Alamo&#39;s policy applies only to large cars. Alamo has a rental office in Newark, but none in New York City. AVOIDING HERTZ&#39; SURCHARGE</p> <p>To enter Hertz&#39;s &quot;Responsible Renter Qualification Program&quot; and avoid the surcharge, you must pay $25 and give the company your name, address, date of birth and other personal information. The company will then check your driving record. It must be clean, and you must have been employed for the last 12 months. Then, when you call for a reservation, the agent will quote you a rate that does not include the surcharge.</p> <p>Approval takes about two weeks. If you are rejected, Hertz keeps the $25.</p> <p>To reduce fraud, the company said, it will not issue an identification card. Its computerized information will be available to rental agents at counters.</p> <p>The company will check driving records periodically -- it will not say how often -- and if it finds a ticket for a moving violation in the last three years, it will cancel the certification.</p> <p>The program will begin in 90 days. Forms will be available at all Hertz offices in the New York area.</p>
87748>Net Rises for Oil Companies Leading oil companies reported sharply higher earnings from exploration and production operations in the third quarter compared with the depressed levels of a year ago, after a rise of nearly 40 percent in crude oil prices since then.  <p>But this was tempered by lower results in refining and marketing operations. Consequently, companies with major refining and marketing operations like the Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation found the third quarter a continuation of a difficult year. Exxon, the nation&#39;s largest oil company, reported yesterday that third-quarter net income was up only slightly, because of markedly lower profits in refining and marketing, and Mobil showed a slight decline in the third quarter after taking into account a one-time loss last year.</p> <p>The Shell Oil Company, the Atlantic Richfield Company, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Unocal Corporation and the Pennzoil Company all reported higher profits.  Exxon</p> <p>Exxon said its third-quarter net was $1.065 billion, up 1 percent from $1.055 billion a year earlier, or 75 cents a share compared with 73 cents. For the first nine months, profit was down 15 percent, to $3.28 billion, from $3.88 billion, or from $2.68 per share in 1986 to $2.31.</p> <p>The decline in profit over the first nine months would have been sharper if the company had not cut back on capital and exploration expenditures, which were $4.2 billion this year, down 25 percent from the comparable period in 1986. But capital spending was up in the third quarter over the same quarter last year.</p> <p>Third-quarter revenues were $21.9 billion, up 27 percent from $17.2 billion.</p> <p>In a statement, L. G. Rawl, Exxon&#39;s chairman, said, &#39;&#39;Refined product margins continued to be depressed, as product price increases have not kept pace with higher crude costs.&#39;&#39; Crude oil prices averaged $6.50 a barrel higher in the third quarter of this year than last, he said, resulting in higher earnings from exploration and production operations.</p> <p>The company reported third-quarter profits from domestic refining and marketing operations of a scant $7 million, down from $106 million a year ago. For foreign operations, the third-quarter net was $53 million, down from $357 million.</p> <p>Many companies have suffered from crude oil prices rising faster than product prices, analysts said. Dillard Spriggs, of Petroleum Analysis Ltd., said: &#39;&#39;Downstream margins have been very niggardly for all companies. The exploration and production business is doing well, the chemical business is doing well compared with last year, but refining and marketing is down from last year.&#39;&#39;  Shell</p> <p>Shell&#39;s net more than tripled, to $420 million, from $133 million. Revenues rose 41 percent, to $5.65 billion, from $4.01 billion.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Major factors in the improvement were a partial recovery of crude oil prices from a seven-year low, and a record performance in our chemical business,&#39;&#39; said the company president, John F. Bookout. Net income for the quarter from oil and gas exploration and production rose more than ten-fold, to $262 million, from $25 million a year earlier.</p> <p>Production costs were lower in the first half, Shell said, but profit margins on refined products fell, as did natural gas prices.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We are pleased with our strong third-quarter performance, but the substantial improvement only appears dramatic when contrasted with the severely depressed third quarter of 1986,&#39;&#39; Mr. Bookout said.</p> <p>The company is owned by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.  Mobil</p> <p>Mobil said its third-quarter earnings were $319 million, up 75 percent from $182 million a year earlier, or 77 cents a share, compared with 45 cents a share. But results last year were pushed down $150 million by a loss on the sale of the Container Corporation of America; excluding that transaction, Mobil&#39;s results were 4 percent behind the year-ago period.</p> <p>Revenues were $14.4 billion, up 27 percent from $11.3 billion a year earlier.</p> <p>Allan E. Murray, Mobil&#39;s chairman, noted that exploration and production results had risen because of higher prices for crude oil and higher natural gas production, but refining and marketing profits fell.  Occidental Petroleum</p> <p>Occidental Petroleum, which is not heavily engaged in marketing and refining, reported third-quarter earnings of $46 million, or 20 cents per share, up 18 percent from $39 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose 14 percent to $4.2 billion from $3.7 billion.</p> <p>Boosted by higher crude oil prices, earnings for the company&#39;s oil and gas division were $58 million, compared with a loss of $3 million a year earlier.  ARCO</p> <p>ARCO reported that third-quarter earnings more than tripled, to $315 million, or $1.71 a share, from $102 million, or 56 cents a share. Sales rose 25 percent, to $4.4 billion, from $3.53 billion.</p> <p>Lodwrick M. Cook, chairman and chief executive, cited the same factors. &#39;&#39;Crude oil prices were higher in the third quarter compared with a year ago, leading to significantly improved results from our oil and gas operations,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Results also benefited from higher earnings from Arco Chemical Company and higher crude oil and natural gas liquids production. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from refining and marketing operations.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Gas and oil exploration and production net rose to $235 million, from $41 million in the same period last year. Earnings for refining and marketing dropped to $30 million, from $94 million.  Unocal</p> <p>Unocal reported third-quarter net income of $28.9 million, or 25 cents a share, up 33 percent from $21.8 million, or 19 cents a share. Revenue totaled $2.58 billion, up 35 percent from $1.91 billion.  Pennzoil</p> <p>Pennzoil had net income of $2.8 million, with no earnings per share after payment of preferred dividends, compared with a loss of $10.1 million a year earlier. But Pennzoil&#39;s year-earlier earnings had included a $23.1 million charge; excluding that, the company would have made a profit of $13 million in that period.

1590379>As Risks Make a Helmet More Vital, Fewer Motorcyclists Wear One Dr. Daniel R. Wehner is not sure what business will be like at his emergency room this summer, the first since Pennsylvania repealed its motorcycle helmet law, but he says he hopes the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend will not prove to be typical. That day the ambulances and helicopters brought him six motorcycle casualties. One man, who had been wearing a helmet, had a broken leg. The other five, who had not been wearing helmets, all had brain injuries. &#39;&#39;Most of the time, if your brain&#39;s O.K., we can save you,&#39;&#39; said Dr. Wehner, the chairman of the emergency medical department at Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center, a regional trauma center. For a brain injury, he said, &#39;&#39;there&#39;s very little we can do.&#39;&#39;  <p>Dr. Wehner has a curbside view of a crisis. Motorcycling, which is growing in popularity, is also growing much more dangerous. Motorcycle deaths last year were up 11 percent over 2002, to 3,592, and were up almost 70 percent since 1997. The risk has increased so much that there were 50 percent more deaths per mile in 2002 than in 1997.</p> <p>No one is sure quite why, although the repeal of helmet laws in 31 states, many in the last few years, is one reason. Another likely factor is that motorcycles are getting faster, and their riders are getting older; all six of Dr. Wehner&#39;s highway casualties, for example, were at least 40.</p> <p>That Sunday, there were also two casualties on a racecourse near town, both young men. On the track, they are required to wear helmets, and their injuries were limited to broken bones.</p> <p>The federal government is eager to reduce the carnage, but beyond advocating helmets, it is not sure how. Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said an in-depth study was needed. &#39;&#39;You can&#39;t really develop any sort of regulatory solution until you understand why motorcycles are crashing in the first place,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Tyson, a motorcyclist who is president of a club for fans of Ducati, an upscale Italian make.</p> <p>The Motorcycle Safety Foundation, a group financed by manufacturers, says the solution is rider training. But its officials acknowledge that such training may be of benefit mostly to novices, with little impact after the first six months.</p> <p>The fact that motorcycling is no longer just for the young and rebellious is apparent at a small hospital, 30 miles east of Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center. Every morning, Marc J. Finder, a 50-year-old emergency room doctor, rides 22 miles to work on a BMW R1100 RT. His colleagues tease him, saying he is riding a &#39;&#39;donor-cycle,&#39;&#39; a reference to riders becoming organ donors.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;All of life is risk,&#39;&#39; Dr. Finder said. &#39;&#39;The issue is how much we control it.&#39;&#39; He said he always wears boots, long-sleeved shirts and a helmet.</p> <p>When victims arrive at his emergency room without helmets, he said, he tries to persuade the victims to wear them, although he said helmets cut down on hearing, can interfere with vision and are hot. Riding helmetless is &#39;&#39;seductive,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Dr. Finder is in some ways typical of today&#39;s riders, in age and purchasing. He got his first bike in 1999 and is now on his second, which has more horsepower than his old Subaru sedan. With his son now out of college, he is shopping for a third, faster one.</p> <p>There are no precise statistics on the age of riders, but the federal government does track those who die. Deaths among people 50 and over were up 24 percent in 2002, the last year for which the breakdown is available; deaths among people under 40 declined slightly.</p> <p>Some wonder whether older riders are more vulnerable because of slower reflexes or impaired judgment. And while some assume that older riders might take fewer risks, Chuck Hurley, a spokesman for the National Safety Council, said that older riders were no more cognizant of risk than younger ones. &#39;&#39;The greater the risk, the greater the risk denial,&#39;&#39; he said. And many older riders can afford as much horsepower as they can handle, or more, experts say.</p> <p>Buck Shinkman, who is 60, used to be satisfied commuting from his home in Bethesda, Md., to his job at the State Department in Washington on a 1995 Harley-Davidson Wide Glide motorcycle, which cruises at 65 or 70 miles an hour. But in 2002, Harley came out with the V-Rod, which &#39;&#39;goes like crazy,&#39;&#39; he said -- zero to 60 in 3.4 seconds -- and he bought one. It reaches 60 m.p.h. faster than all but the speediest sports cars, and far faster than most airplanes rolling toward takeoff.</p> <p>Mr. Shinkman said he had had just one accident in many years of riding. He wears conservative ties over button-down white shirts, with his State Department ID hanging around his neck on a Harley-Davidson lanyard. Does he race the V-Rod?</p> <p>&#39;&#39;No, no, good Lord, no,&#39;&#39; he said, but added: &#39;&#39;Just occasionally, somebody at a traffic light gets a little snitty. I have to blow them off.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>At Battley Cycles, in Gaithersburg, Md., a northern suburb of Washington, many of the buyers are older, said the owner, Devin Battley. What he hears from prospective customers these days, Mr. Battley said, is, &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve got the kids&#39; college education figured out, so now I can get my motorcycle.&#39;&#39; In fact, many of his motorcycles sell for up to $20,000, the equivalent of a semester&#39;s college expenses at a top private school.</p> <p>Mr. Battley said he worried about selling a novice more bike than he can handle. He sold six to Mike Tyson, the boxer, beginning in 1997, and pleaded with him to take lessons. Getting good at any sport requires a trainer, he said he told Mr. Tyson. Mr. Battley, who has been selling motorcycles for 20 years, said big bikes were selling well. But while the big engines have caught on, sophisticated braking control systems have not.</p> <p>Many of the heavier and faster motorcycles now have power-assisted disc brakes but most lack antilock brakes, and have a setup akin to a bicycle&#39;s, with separate front and rear controls. Unlike a car, a motorcycle requires the operator to decide how much force to apply to each brake. There is substantial evidence that in emergencies, many riders do it incorrectly, avoiding the front brake, even though it has 70 to 80 percent of the stopping potential.</p> <p>Mr. Battley said many riders would not want linked brakes, which apply in the front and the rear, or antilock brake systems. But based on the maintenance work his shop performs, many of his customers use the rear brake too much. He often finds the rear brake pads more worn than the front ones.</p> <p>Hugh H. Hurt Jr., a safety researcher in California, who has investigated crashes of police motorcyclists and other experienced riders, said the rear brake locks and the rider can lose control, or fail to slow down enough to avoid a crash. Some police departments have switched to BMWs, he said, one of the brands that has linked brake systems.</p> <p>But Lee D. Edmunds, a spokesman for Honda, said that many customers do not even want linked or antilock brakes. &#39;&#39;They want to be able to have full control over that,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Among motorcyclists, openness to improved technology depends on the rider, Mr. Edmunds said. &#39;&#39;The pure performance guys, those guys resist that technology,&#39;&#39; he said. The &#39;&#39;re-entry guy&#39;&#39; -- the rider returning to the motorcycle because his children are older -- would probably accept it, he said.</p> <p>For some older riders, the lure of the motorcycle is indeed powerful. Ron McKinnon, 57, of suburban Virginia, has arthritis and says he lacks the strength to support the cycle at a red light. So he cruises around on a powerful, three-wheeled Honda. His grandchildren love to ride along. &#39;&#39;Grandpa can take kids on his motorcycle, so Grandpa is cool,&#39;&#39; he says they tell him.</p>
768629>F.A.A. Opposed to Requiring Baby Seats The Federal Aviation Administration told Congress yesterday that requiring babies on planes to ride in safety seats remained a bad idea, despite a renewed recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board. The aviation agency also said that using two kinds of child restraints, booster seats and harness web belts, was more risky than simply strapping a child into an adult lap belt. It proposed banning the child restraints.  <p>The proposal, if adopted, means that some parents may drive to anairport with their children in a government-approved safety device -- as required by state motor vehicle law -- and find that it cannot be used on the airplane.</p> <p>Linda Hall Daschle, the deputy administrator of the F.A.A., said the message to parents using harness belts was: &quot;You need to go out and buy another child safety device.&quot; Parents using booster seats should send them as checked baggage, she said, asserting that children big enough for a booster seat are big enough to be buckled into adult lap belts in their own seats.</p> <p>At the Association of Flight Attendants, which has called for requiring restraints for all children, Jill F. Gallagher, a spokeswoman for the union, called the move &quot;an odd thing to do&quot; because harness belts are uncommon anyway. The F.A.A. should simply have required the use of automobile baby seats, she said.</p> <p>In tests, the F.A.A. found that rear-facing child safety seats, which are typically used for children 20 pounds and under, would perform well in a plane crash. Forward-facing seats, commonly used in cars for children 20 to 40 pounds, were not nearly as good, the F.A.A. said, but in a &quot;tip sheet&quot; for parents the agency advised that &quot;current devices offer dramatic improvements in protection compared to lap-held and/or unrestrained children.&quot; Children 40 pounds and more should simply use the lap belt, the agency said.</p> <p>The use of child restraints on planes became a major issue seven years ago, after the crash of a United Airlines jet in a cornfield near the Sioux City airport in July 1989. But the proposed rules announced yesterday would be the first to sort out, from among the dozens of devices used in cars all over the country, what works well in an airline cabin.</p> <p>In the Sioux City crash a child riding in its mother&#39;s lap was killed but might have survived if it had been strapped into a baby seat, the National Transportation Safety Board said. It made the same finding about a 9-month-old girl killed on a USAir jet that crashed on approach to Charlotte, N.C., in July 1994.</p> <p>But the F.A.A., in a report to Congress delivered yesterday, reiterated a position it has taken for years, that if it required baby seats for children under 2 and parents had to buy tickets for those children, some families would choose less safe means of travel, like cars.</p> <p>&quot;We&#39;re not going to do a Federal rule that kills more babies than it saves,&quot; Ms. Daschle said. By her agency&#39;s calculation, use of appropriate child seats could save five infants&#39; lives over the next 10 years, but if the airlines charged full fare for a child, enough people would choose to drive instead so that total deaths, child and adult, would increase by 82.</p> <p>Instead, the agency issued the tip sheet and said it was encouraging airlines to discount seats for children under 2. Ms. Daschle and other experts could identify only one airline that now does so, Southwest.</p> <p>Until recently the major airlines&#39; trade association, the Air Transport Association, had petitioned the F.A.A. to make baby seats mandatory. But the association dropped the petition last month, because, said Christopher Chiames, a spokesman, &quot;there were findings that some seats were not safe.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;We did not want to be in the position of encouraging the F.A.A. to require the use of seats that were not safe,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Among the problems uncovered in crash simulations was that in airline cabins, restraints designed for cars often let a child&#39;s head smash into the seat in front. One idea being tested by the F.A.A. is to remove the seat cushion, which would put the child&#39;s head lower; since the seat in front is angled back, that would give more space.</p> <p>Mr. Chiames would not say whether the airlines would return to advocating the mandatory use of such seats once the F.A.A. had established which ones were safe.</p> <p>Other analysts have suggested that some might offer steep discounts on seats for children under 2. Southwest, for example, offers discounts of nearly 60 percent off unrestricted, one-way fares; from Baltimore to Chicago is $99 for adults, $94 for children 2 to 21 and $45 for an infant if the parent buys a seat.</p> <p>If there is a vacant seat on a Southwest flight, a parent can bring on a car seat for free rather than take the baby on the lap, but often there are no extra seats. &quot;We want to offer this extra peace of mind for the parent, to know in advance you can use the car seat,&quot; said a spokeswoman, Ginger Hardage. But the discount is off the unrestricted fare; the 21-day advance purchase fare is $47 for adults and children, while the baby fare is still $45, virtually the same as an extra ticket.</p> <p>And it is not clear that other airlines will follow. Julius Maldutis, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said that &quot;there&#39;s a real shortage of seats, and airlines have been able to increase the price of their product.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I doubt very much they would now start offering special discounts for under-age children,&quot; Mr. Maldutis said. &quot;The industry dynamics point just in the opposite direction.&quot;</p> <p>The F.A.A. has a toll-free consumer telephone line, (800) 322-7873, available 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. Eastern time, where operators can mail the tip sheet or give instructions for obtaining the information via the Internet or Compuserve.</p> <p>Correction:  June 9, 1995, Friday</p> <p>A headline yesterday about infant safety seats on airliners misstated the position of the Federal Aviation Administration in some copies. As the article reported, the agency said that it opposed requiring babies to ride in safety seats and that certain types of restraints were risky; it did not call all safety seats a bad idea.</p>
809322>Economy Champs Get the Cold Shoulder FOR years, the people who lobby against tougher fuel economy rules have argued that not many American buyers want the highest-mileage cars. The 10 most  fuel-efficient models, they pointed out, account for less than 2 percent of sales. But now, they say, that argument is outdated; in the &#39;95 model year, it was less than 1 percent. The decline was modest, to nine-tenths of a percent in the 1995 model year from 1.26 percent in 1994. In actual numbers, the slippage was smaller, because  the number of cars sold rose last year to 8.2 million, from 6.1 million the year before. But the lobbyists have a point; at the extreme high end of the fuel economy scale, as in the car market as a whole, gas mileage is clearly not as important as it used to be.  <p>Honda, for example, has dropped the model that won the 1995 fuel economy derby, the Civic VX hatchback, at 47 miles to the gallon in the city, 56 on the  highway. Hatchbacks don&#39;t sell well these days and consumers want more muscle under the hood, a spokesman, Jeffrey Smith, said. The replacement is the Civic HX coupe with a 1.6-liter VTEC-E engine and 115 horsepower, up from 1.5 liters and 70 horses.</p> <p>The difference: a mileage rating of 39 city/45 highway, compared with 47 city/56 highway for the model it replaces. The car now comes with some comforts  formerly associated with a guzzler: dual air bags, power steering, dual power mirrors, power windows, power locks and &quot;a host of other convenience features,&quot;  the company says.</p> <p>General Motors dropped its highest-mileage model, the Geo Metro XFi, a 3-cylinder, 1-liter model, after the 1994 model year. Despite a redesign, sales  of other Metros were off a bit in the &#39;95 model year, to 100,092 from 108,000 for &#39;94, but a company spokesman said it could be because potential buyers at the lowest rungs of the new-car market went for used cars instead, or for other  reasons. &quot;We could talk all day about how to account for a sales increase or decrease,&quot; said Daniel R. Hubbert, the spokesman. &quot;It&#39;s kind of like polling the O.J. jury.&quot;</p> <p>But he did identify one reason: consumers of the smallest cars are doing what buyers of bigger vehicles do. &quot;People who previously bought a small car, or wanted a car with great gas mileage, are now going for small trucks,&quot; Mr. Hubbert said. They like being able to haul big things, he said, and they like sitting higher above the road.</p> <p>Switching from the &#39;95 Geo Metro, with the 1-liter 3-cylinder engine and a 5-speed manual transmission, to the Chevrolet S-10 pickup, with a 2.2-liter 4-cyclinder and a 5-speed, meant a mileage drop to 23 m.p.g. city/29 highway, from 44 city/49 highway. Jumping to the Geo Tracker convertible, the company&#39;s most fuel-efficient sport-utlity, with a 1.6-liter engine and a five-speed manual transmission, meant moving to 25 m.p.g. city/27 highway.</p> <p>Moving from a car to a sport-utility vehicle or a truck means losing fuel economy for several reasons. One, vehicle weight, is obvious, but another is less advanced technology. In 1994, 70 percent of new cars had multi-point fuel injection, compared with only 3 percent of light trucks and vans, according to John DeCicco of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.</p> <p>And truck and van economy is going nowhere, literally. House and Senate conferees recently agreed to freeze mileage standards for light pickups, vans and sport utility vehicles for one year.</p> <p>Mileage seems to be a lagging interest everywhere. At Ford, sales of the Aspire, the sixth-highest-mileage car in the 1996 rankings, are strong. But Ford&#39;s customer surveys show that economy now ranks 16th out of 19 reasons for choosing a particular car.</p>
270983>Northeast Utilities Bids For Owner of Seabrook Northeast Utilities yesterday offered to buy the assets of the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, including its share of the Seabrook nuclear reactor, for $1.9 billion, and to limit rate increases to 5.5 percent a year for the first seven years. Northeast had bid for Public Service&#39;s nonnuclear assets, as had the New England Electric  <p>Northeast Utilities yesterday offered to buy the assets of the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, including its share of the Seabrook nuclear reactor, for $1.9 billion, and to limit rate increases to 5.5 percent a year for the first seven years. Northeast had bid for Public Service&#39;s nonnuclear assets, as had the New England Electric System.</p> <p>The State of New Hampshire, with which Northeast had been negotiating for weeks, immediately accepted the offer, although it reserved the right to consider any higher bid that might be made.</p> <p>Northeast, based in Hartford, said its offer for the bankrupt utility company was more concrete than competing bids because it included a rate plan. High-Level Support</p> <p>Gov. Judd Gregg said the Northeast deal would be better for rate payers than a plan proposed by a bankruptcy examiner. He said the examiner&#39;s plan &#39;&#39;gouges New Hampshire consumers&#39;&#39; to satisfy the utility&#39;s creditors.</p> <p>Wilbur Ross, an adviser to a committee representing Public Service&#39;s stockholders, said the offer from Northeast, New England&#39;s largest utility, was still much too low.</p> <p>With the tentative backing of the state, the Public Service bankruptcy, which began 18 months ago, appeared to take a step toward resolution. The Federal Bankruptcy Code is not clear on whether a state&#39;s authority to regulate utility rates is preserved when the utility comes under the control of a bankruptcy court.</p> <p>The bankruptcy court in Manchester, N.H., has set Tuesday as the deadline for bids. New England Electric, based in Westborough, Mass., said yesterday that it might amend its $1.4 billion bid made in April.</p> <p>Public Service, which is also in Manchester, said through a spokesman yesterday that it had not seen the Northeast bid and could not comment. The company has its own plan for emerging from bankruptcy.</p> <p>Northeast and New England Electric had bid for the nonnuclear assets of Public Service, the first electric utility owned by investors to enter bankruptcy since the Depression.</p> <p>The reason was largely because of the Seabrook plant, in the New Hamsphire seacoast town of the same name. After large cost overruns, the plant was blocked from operating by objections from six Massachusetts towns that are within Seabrook&#39;s 10-mile emergency zone. The towns have refused to cooperate in emergency planning, and have even chopped down utility poles on which warning sirens were mounted. $1.35 Billion Is Offered In January, Northeast Utilities bid $1.2 billion for the nonnuclear assets. Yesterday it offered $1.35 billion, plus $575 million for Public Service&#39;s 35.6 percent share of Seabrook.</p> <p>The figure would imply that the entire reactor, on which more than $5 billion has been spent, has a market value of only about $1.6 billion. But William B. Ellis, Northeast&#39;s chairman, said yesterday that the pricing of the reactor was only for accounting purposes, and could only be viewed in the context of the bid for the whole company.</p> <p>Northeast&#39;s bid assumes that Seabrook will run. If it does not, Mr. Ellis said, the rate increase each year would be 1.1 percent over the 5.5 percent originally intended. &#39;&#39;The rate issue is a blank that needed filling in in anybody&#39;s offer,&#39;&#39; he said. Mr. Ellis added that &#39;&#39;all offers were quite hypotethical, unless the state indicated its willingness to go along.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The deal would also have to be approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but Northeast already operates four nuclear plants and believes it could win that approval.</p>
393694>At Indian Point, No Second-Guessing After an Accident With Nuclear Fuel Technicians at the Indian Point 3 nuclear power plant probably did everything they could to avoid dropping a fuel assembly, according to experts at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, both of which supervised the work.  <p>The fuel assembly fell about 10 feet on Tuesday night, but officials of the New York Power Authority, which owns the 14-year-old reactor, said there was no trace of additional radiation in the water in which the assembly was moved or in the air above, indicating that the assembly apparently did not break open.</p> <p>A variety of experts said yesterday that even if the tubes had ruptured, the radiation would probably have been kept inside the dome-shaped containment building.</p> <p>Rescue Plan Goes Awry</p> <p>Two of the highly radioactive assemblies were inadvertently lifted from the nuclear core on Oct. 4 when they became snagged on a plate that was being removed in preparation for refueling. After 12 days of analysis and planning, workers on Tuesday afternoon moved the plate, with assemblies attached, away from the reactor vessel to an area where they had set up two steel baskets.</p> <p>The plan was to lower the assemblies gently into the baskets. But when the plate stopped moving, the assemblies rocked back and forth and one dropped into the basket, a distance of about 10 feet.</p> <p>Workers at the plant, in Buchanan, N.Y., used remotely operated tools yesterday to pry the other fuel assembly loose from the plate after it had been lowered into its basket.</p> <p>The unused fuel is not very radioactive, but when the reactor runs, it splits the atoms of uranium into pieces, and the &#39;&#39;daughter&#39;&#39; atoms, some solid and some gaseous, are highly radioactive. The fuel is in long, thin tubes bundled together in assemblies. The tubes form the first barrier against release of radiation into the plant and the environment.</p> <p>Evacuation as a Precaution</p> <p>When the assembly fell Tuesday, the 16 workers in that building left immediately, as a precaution. They re-entered the containment later in the evening.</p> <p>Yesterday experts outside the Power Authority said that fuel-handling accidents were rare and that this one, once it began, was hard to solve.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Hindsight is wonderful,&#39;&#39; said Robert C. Jones, chief of the reactor systems branch of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. &#39;&#39;But given the situation, if we went back with the same kind of problem now, there is not much likelihood we could come up with a better decision.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The two snagged assemblies were not detected until they had been lifted nearly 20 feet above the top of the core. Experts said their combined weight, about 3,000 pounds, would be almost undetectable on the meters that monitor the lift, because the plate and other parts to which they were attached weigh 122,000 pounds, and the resistance of the water creates additional strain.</p> <p>Reactor experts say the plate moving out of the reactor is a bit like a cork coming out of a bottle; there is little ability to see the lower surface of the plate until it has been raised a few feet. The operation is under 24 feet of water, which is used to keep the assemblies cool and shield the radiation; used assemblies are far too radioactive for human contact.</p> <p>Camera Aid to Be Explored</p> <p>Thomas A. Christopher, general manager of the nuclear service division of Westinghouse, said his company would explore whether to develop a camera that could be lowered to see around the corner and observe the assemblies as the plate is lifted.</p> <p>Westinghouse manufactured the major components at Indian Point and, under contract with the Power Authority, was supervising the refueling. Mr. Christopher said that more than 100 plants of Westinghouse&#39;s design were running around the world, with 70 or 80 refuelings a year. The incident at Indian Point is only the third of its type, he said.</p> <p>Even if the stuck assemblies at Indian Point had been discovered earlier, experts say, it would have been risky to lower them back into their place in the grid-like core, because they might not be hanging straight. And even if they were successfully lowered, there was no mechanism for disentangling them from the plate.</p> <p>At Indian Point yesterday, workers were preparing to examine the two assemblies in the baskets to see if they could be moved to the spent fuel pool with the usual tools and procedures.</p>
663372>Ideas &amp; Trends: America&#39;s Automotive Fashion Statement; Forget Sleek and Sexy. The Boxy and Bulky Look Is In. VERY soon, the car in the average family&#39;s garage isn&#39;t going to be a car at all; it&#39;s going to be a truck. Small trucks -- pick-ups, vans, four-by-fours -- were once a symbol of blue-collar grit, but like pre-washed blue jeans, they are now the upscale dream. A whole new class of small trucks, for which the industry has invented a new term, the &quot;sport-utility vehicle,&quot; has sprung up, and they threaten dominance over the car; from Impalas to Pintos, cars now seem like something to be herded away by the Rodeos, Wranglers, Explorers and Blazers.  <p>Every decade has its automotive style. The 1950&#39;s models had swagger and fins, reflecting the cocksure certainty of the post-war age. In the early 60&#39;s, gas was cheap and baby boomers were plentiful, so there were muscle cars. Then came the first oil crisis, in 1973, and environmentally correct compacts with their fuel-efficient engines. Although Cadillacs downsized a little in the 80&#39;s, that decade generally returned conspicuous consumption to style with a binge of sleek luxury models.</p> <p>Maybe the 90&#39;s will be easier to characterize in retrospect, but from this end of the decade, the back-to-basics cliche seems to hold, and people seem ready for the bulky and boxy, from the amiable practicality of mini-vans to the rugged four-wheel-drive models, which seem to be an automotive echo of the mountain bike.</p> <p>Though increasing concern for health and safety may extend to the automotive realm, in truth the trucks may not be any healthier than other vehicles. They do not quite meet the same emission standards as cars nor all of the same crash standards, although their safety features are improving.</p> <p>Still, these are not the battered, rough-and-tumble vehicles of the Marlboro Man. The term truck, in fact, barely fits, giving rise to Detroit&#39;s hyphenated coinage, sport-utility. They are air-conditioned and carpeted; most can be ordered with leather interiors. Dodge Ram pickups, once touted for toughness, are now advertised as being triple-sealed to keep out irritants like wind noise, and are available with a &quot;business console&quot; that includes cellular phone and auxiliary power outlet.</p> <p>The trucks have shed some of their sluggishness; according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the average 0-60 time last year was 12 seconds, a mere half-second slower than for cars. Some of the vehicles surely get driven off the paved road, but most spend their lives in traffic jams and on urban freeways.  The Eddie Bauer Edition</p> <p>Many of these vehicles look like something out of an upscale catalogue; the Ford Explorer even comes in an &quot;Eddie Bauer edition.&quot; The others could probably be described as the &quot;Walter Mitty&quot; editions, except that the term is perhaps too gender-specific. Women are often the buyers, and for the most expensive models they constitute half of the purchasers. They get what men get, a feeling of mastery over the road. For the commute between high-stress job and hectic home, it may be more mastery than people get at either destination.</p> <p>Overall, among all the &quot;light duty&quot; vehicles sold in the 1993 model year, more than 34 percent were trucks, including sport-utilities and mini-vans, according to the E.P.A., up from 19 percent in 1975, when the agency started keeping track. Families have not gotten larger, nor have roads gotten less paved; it is almost entirely a matter of taste. The prospect is for more growth. Chrysler found that 3 percent of customers who own trucks plan to replace them with cars while 9 percent of those who own cars plan to replace them with trucks.</p> <p>&quot;People want to express themselves in a vehicle, they want to make a statement and they want a vehicle to fit their lifestyle,&quot; said A.P.G. Richards, the general product manager at Chrysler&#39;s Jeep &amp; Truck Business Operations, at a recent conference of the American Society of Automotive Analysts. Drivers want to sit higher up off the road, said John McElroy, editor in chief of Automotive Industries magazine. &quot;It imparts a feeling of security,&quot; he said.</p> <p>It makes the automakers feel secure, too, especially after fruitless years of trying to sell small cars at a profit. According to Adrian T. Dillon, vice president of planning at Eaton Corporation, which manufactures car parts, if sales to rental fleets are factored out, retail sales of cars have been &quot;declining one half percent per year for a very long time.&quot; But light truck retail sales are gaining at 5.5 percent per year, he said.</p> <p>Better yet, only 4 percent of the light trucks are imported and only another 8 percent are built by &quot;transplants,&quot; Japanese or European companies assembling vehicles in this country, he said. &quot;Detroit invented this business and retains it,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But there is a disadvantage: fuel. The 1993 cars averaged 28 miles per gallon compared with 20.8 gallons for light utility vehicles. Both figures are just above the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards that Washington mandates. There is another reason for manufacturers to like it when a customer picks, say, a four-by-four over a station wagon: the big wagon would drag down the company&#39;s corporate average fuel economy, but the van fits comfortably into the light truck standard. Repeated over and over again, such decisions will have a major effect on fuel consumption. Picking an Explorer over a Taurus wagon, for example, means going to 20 miles per gallon on the highway instead of 28, comparing both vehicles with the largest available engine.</p> <p>But this is hardly a public policy issue lately. In fact oil imports are of so little general interest that Americans for Energy Independence, a lobbying group that opened its doors shortly after the Arab oil embargo of 1973, closed last month, citing &quot;energy apathy.&quot;</p> <p>At the laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich., where the E.P.A. calculates fuel economy, Karl H. Hellman, the chief of the technology development branch, said that when the oil crisis hit and Congress imposed fuel economy regulations, &quot;cars did the job.&quot; But the saved fuel is gone, he said. &quot;Trucks ate it.&quot;</p>
434255>WIDER PERIL FOUND IN NUCLEAR WASTE FROM BOMB MAKING Engineers rushing to build nuclear bombs in the 1950&#39;s dumped millions of gallons of radioactive waste into the ground at the Hanford nuclear reservation near Richland, Wash., a new analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency shows. Dirt from the reservation may be as dangerous as highly radioactive wastes stored in special tanks, the agency said. But the Federal Government is still struggling to measure the level of contamination and has little idea of how to contain the danger. Wind, rain, birds, animals, and underground water flow can all spread the radioactivity to the Columbia River, which forms one border of the 470-square-mile reservation, and even farther afield.  <p>Some of the wastes were injected deep into the earth. Some were dumped in open trenches or ponds, which were later filled in with bulldozers. The dumping sites are scattered in areas where reactors were operated or where used reactor fuel was chemically broken up to recover plutonium for use in bombs.  Unknown Dangers</p> <p>Forty years ago engineers for the Atomic Energy Commission, a predecessor of the Energy Department, were making bomb fuel at Hanford and were running out of room to store dangerous radioactive wastes. They divided the wastes into two types: one, rated highly radioactive, was stored in tanks, with the thought that someday a solution for permanent storage would be found, and the second, believed to contain relatively little dangerous material, was dumped into underground drainage systems.</p> <p>The drains were built to allow the water-laden wastes to flow slowly down through the soil, with the soil functioning as a filter. Although the engineers did not realize it at the time, the wastes they were dumping in the ground actually contained two very long-lived radioactive materials, technetium 99 and iodine 129.</p> <p>While much of the radioactive materials in the special storage tanks naturally degrade into harmless minerals over about 300 years, half of a given amount of technetium 99 is still radioactive after 212,000 years, and the half-life for iodine 129 is 16 million years. Both are readily absorbed into the human body and can cause cancer.</p> <p>Hanford was already known to be among the most polluted radioactive dumping grounds in the world, but the emerging understanding of the hazards there again shows the dangers created by a helter-skelter rush to production. More than five years after the complex first began to open itself to outside scrutiny, such perilous practices continue to come to light.</p> <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has begun uncovering the extent of the unsafe dumping in a continuing review of Hanford documents, part of the effort to decide what to clean up first at the reservation. Differing on Health Threat</p> <p>The most radioactive material, including the technetium and iodine, was dumped many miles from the Columbia River. Timothy L. Nord, section head for Hanford at the Washington Department of Ecology, said it would take many years for that material to be exposed through wind erosion. But underground water can also spread the wastes, he said, adding, &quot;We don&#39;t understand the ground water flow and the geology that well.&quot;</p> <p>Meanwhile, he said, because of dumping closer to the Columbia, other radioactive isotopes like strontium 90 are continuing to flow into the river.</p> <p>&quot;From a health standpoint, it&#39;s not an imminent threat or anything like that,&quot; Mr. Nord said. But he added that the Department of Energy is still discharging chemical and radioactive wastes to the soil in 27 different streams, even as engineers try to find ways to clean up past releases.</p> <p>Other Government researchers say that the hazard from the large-scale dumping in the 1950&#39;s may be substantial. &quot;It may be that the most significant risk to people living in the vicinity of this plant, over time, is the exposure to these long-lived isotopes,&quot; said Robert Alvarez, a member of the staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which has uncovered many of the problems in the nuclear bomb complex. &quot;Only mother nature is controlling them, and we don&#39;t know to what extent that is working,&quot; he said.  127 Million Gallons</p> <p>Douglas R. Sherwood, an environmental engineer in the E.P.A.&#39;s Richland office, said the materials in the soil were &quot;very important to calculations of long-term dose to man from releases at Hanford.&quot; In terms of curies, the unit by which radioactive material is measured, most of the releases went into the tanks, but the wastes that went into the dirt are so long-lived that they may turn out to be just as important, Mr. Sherwood said.</p> <p>His supervisor in the Seattle regional office of the agency, Randall F. Smith, said the technology may not exist to recover some of the wastes dumped in the dirt.</p> <p>The records show that through the late 1950&#39;s, the bomb makers dumped 127 million gallons, which was more than they saved in the tanks at the time. The dumping of large volumes of wastes was first reported earlier this month, by The Spokane Spokesman-Review, based partly on an E.P.A. memo.</p> <p>The goal of the dumping, according to a 1958 memo by two chemists employed by General Electric, which then operated the plant, was to &quot;provide tank storage space that safeguarded the continuity of operation of prime chemical processing plants.&quot;  Drains Overflowed</p> <p>The drainage system was supposed to hold radioactive material underground but above the water table, but engineers had early indications that their designs were based on faulty assumptions. Wastes from a drain would overflow and show up in water underground, and the use of that drain would be stopped.</p> <p>Government documents show that the wastes began to spread almost as soon as they were dumped. By May of 1958, for example, workers found radioactive rabbit and coyote dung scattered over 2,000 acres. The animals had been using the radioactive chemicals as a salt lick, the report suggests.</p> <p>Because the wastes they saved were more concentrated than the wastes they dumped, the bomb makers appear to have retained most of the radiation in the relative security of the tanks, which have leaked at times but are still largely intact.</p> <p>The tanks themselves have been under intense scrutiny for months, because of a risk that they may explode, thus spreading their contents to the air and soil. The Department of Energy is planning to spend more than $1 billion on a factory that will convert their contents into glass, for long-term storage.</p> <p>Other problems at the reservation were long known to the bomb makers but made public only in recent years. For example, the 1958 General Electric memo notes that strontium 90 was being dumped in concentrations thousands or tens of thousands of times higher than allowable limits for public access.</p> <p>Later documents showed that enough plutonium to build several bombs was also discharged into the soil. Plutonium, which is not a waste but a bomb fuel and the primary product at Hanford, is toxic in very small quantities. If it is discharged in a way that allows it to clump together -- in a layer, for example, as it settles -- it creates a risk of accidental nuclear reaction.</p>
470152>Making a Difference/The Soviet Coup; The Kremlinologist of Oil The coup in Moscow last week briefly revived Kremlinology, the pre-glasnost art of interpreting the Soviet Union from the scattered clues that emerge from a totalitarian facade. One of the experts to whom the American press and the business community turned for guidance was Thane Gustafson, a Georgetown University professor of government. Mr. Gustafson said that he began his study of Soviet politics in 1964, the year Khrushchev fell, and as a result, &quot;I felt right at home&quot; last week.  <p>Mr. Gustafson&#39;s specialty is the oil industry, which provides about 70 percent of the Soviet Union&#39;s foreign exchange and has lately been in sharp decline.</p> <p>In a recent book on Soviet oil, &quot;Crisis Amid Plenty,&quot; Mr. Gustafson wrote that efforts to maintain production in the late 1970&#39;s had sucked up most of the Soviet Union&#39;s capital, causing stagnation in the rest of Soviet industry.</p> <p>Oil continues to be near the heart of the Soviet Union&#39;s problems. It is a key source of tension between the republics and the central government over who should control its development. And twice in the last year, Mr. Gustafson said, authorities have &quot;bought off&quot; restive oil workers with extra allocations of imported food and manufactured goods, to the resentment of other workers.</p> <p>Mr. Gustafson, who is 47, started in the Soviet energy field as an analyst at the Rand Corporation, getting interested when Ronald Reagan put an embargo on natural gas pipeline technology in 1981 after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Later, he headed Soviet studies at Georgetown&#39;s Center for Strategic and International Studies. A graduate of the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, where he studied political science and chemistry, and a Peace Corps volunteer in the Ivory Coast, he spent the 1970&#39;s at Harvard, first getting a doctorate in political science and then teaching.</p> <p>This month, he began a leave of absence from Georgetown to become the director of Soviet studies at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
258557>How the Northeast Asserted Itself on Smog AS summer falls like a hazy curtain across the Northeast, officials in eight states are predicting that the air this year will be a little less visible than it would otherwise be because of a regional effort to cut the ingredients of smog.  <p>In the last few days, many service stations in New Jersey, New York and all six New England states have switched to a formula that resists evaporation. Experts say the change will reduce gasoline&#39;s contribution to the causes of ozone about 15 percent, and will cut overall smog levels by about 7.5 percent. A smaller reduction in pollution will come from more gas stations&#39; use of devices on their pumps to keep vapors from being released into the air.</p> <p>That still leaves the Northeast, like most of urban America, a long way from compliance with Federal clean-air standards. But the new state rules, which will be in effect each summer - when the atmospheric conditions favor ozone formation - point the way for further improvements through a new twist on Federalism: the states cajoling Washington to permit them to confederate.</p> <p>In Washington, where the oil companies are strong, the Environmental Protection Agency resisted imposing rules on gasoline evaporation. When the states acted on their own, the E.P.A. responded with a much less stringent requirement. Only after Massachusetts threatened to sue did Washington begin approving the states&#39; rules. Last week, in fact, the E.P.A. added New Jersey to the list.</p> <p>The rules will take effect June 30, six weeks later than the states had wanted. Because the oil companies refine products weeks before they are sold, many have already made the switch.</p> <p>Encouraged by their progress with gasoline, officials from the eight states met last week on Block Island to discuss additional action against smog. A promising way to cut pollution, said Thomas C. Jorling, New York&#39;s Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, is the adoption of California&#39;s automobile equipment rules in the Northeast. Also under discussion are joint rules on the formulation of such consumer products as house paint, hairspray and deodorant to cut their emission of ozone-causing chemicals.</p> <p>Many steps could be taken by the states singly, but ozone pollution presents what may be a unique case for joint action. It is formed by the action of the sun on pollutants over many hours, so that the worst ozone problems often occur miles downwind of the population concentrations. Thus last summer rural Maine and Vermont exceeded Federal standards. In Connecticut, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman said that even if the state were shut down entirely and returned to pastoral wilderness, emissions from upwind states would still put it in violation.</p> <p>Mr. Lieberman, a Democrat, said that the joint action represented &#39;&#39;a whole new mind-set, a growth in self-awareness and pride in the states as separate centers of government power and government action.&#39;&#39; Spreading Regionalism</p> <p>At the states&#39; umbrella organization, the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, in Boston, Michael J. Bradley, the executive director, said that the move to regulation by the states was &#39;&#39;a response to the lack of progress in the previous eight years&#39;&#39; at the Federal level. He said that the regional initiative would spread, noting that Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania are discussing following the lead of the eight Northeastern states.</p> <p>Last summer&#39;s air was particularly bad because of the unusually hot and dry conditions, which favored smog production. Even without the severe weather, the area&#39;s smog problem is worsening because vehicles are increasing their contribution to air pollution by 2 to 3 percent a year because of more cars, more miles being driven and more congestion. Vehicles contribute 61 percent of the hydrocarbons and 53 percent of the nitrogen oxide emissions. Those two ingredients, plus sunlight, create ozone pollution.</p> <p>Bringing the area into compliance with Federal air standards, Mr. Bradley said, will require much more stringent measures, probably including restrictions on driving that will be far harder to achieve than the kind of improvements carried out this month. The challenge is great: compliance would mean cutting hydrocarbon emissions by 60 percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by 40 percent. The re-formulated gasoline helps reduce hydrocarbons, which are emitted by unburned fuel, but not carbon monoxide, a combustion product. That poison exists wherever congestion is particularly bad. The fuel also does not control nitrogen oxide.</p> <p>Both of those chemicals could be managed with better anti-pollution equipment on cars, but Mr. Bradley suggested that a more direct approach would be needed.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;re certainly going to have to stem the growth in vehicle usage, and there&#39;s a strong likelihood we&#39;re going to have to see reductions in the amount of miles being driven,&#39;&#39; Mr. Bradley said. He and other experts think that car pooling is likely to be a bigger help than adding buses and trains, because it it will face less political opposition.</p> <p>But unless more steps are taken, various experts warn, the New York region will face steadily declining air, and unless the states act themselves, it is not clear how far Washington will go. President Bush may give a clue tomorrow, when he is scheduled to reveal his plan for clean air.  THE WEST COAST PRECEDENT</p> <p>WHEREVER America is going, the saying goes, California is getting there first, and that holds true for air pollution measures.</p> <p>The new regulations in the Northeast aimed at reducing pollution from gasoline evaporation have been in force in Southern California since the early 1970&#39;s. The next strategy likely to make its way east would require new cars to have extra pollution equipment, at a cost of about $150 a car, and tougher standards on tailpipe testing.</p> <p>Adoption of California standards in the Northeast would reduce hydrocarbon emissions by 16 percent, nitrogen oxide emissions by 27 percent, and carbon monoxide emissions by 39 percent by the year 2010, regional environmental officials say. The estimates take into account the expected effects of further tightening of the standards as planned by California.</p> <p>California&#39;s restrictions were allowed to continue because they predate the Federal Clean Air Act of 1977. That act forbids other states from adopting their own regulations, but it leaves a loophole that the Northeastern states are considering taking advantage of: the other 49 states, if they think the Federal standards are too lax, can simply adopt California&#39;s.</p> <p>So far no other region has volunteered to adopt its own set of drastic and costly air-cleaning rules like those recently set for the Los Angeles basin. Those measures would ban most free parking and gas-powered lawn mowers as early as this year and leave open the possibility of a ban on all gasoline-powered vehicles by the year 2007.</p> <p>THE REGION</p>
660851>Make-or-Break Year for Electric Cars No matter what year the question is broached, mass-produced electric cars always seem to be just over the horizon. But California rules, which have been adopted and are now in force New York State and are soon to go into effect in Massachusetts as well, will require that 2 percent of the cars sold in the 1998 model year be electrics. So 1994 may represent a moment of truth, whether for the car makers or the regulation writers.  <p>Detroit continues to say that it does not have the technology for an electric car that people will want to buy. But smaller voices say such vehicles can be ready in time.</p> <p>&quot;The electric vehicle is going to start breaking into the market in &#39;94,&quot; predicted Michael Bradley, executive director of an organization of the air pollution chiefs of eight Northeastern states. &quot;We&#39;re going to see the first fruits of a lot of very, very aggressive efforts.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Bradley has strong reason to hope so. He is among those pushing for the Environmental Protection Agency to force adoption of the California rules for the region that extends from northern Virginia up the Atlantic coast to Maine. Such a ruling could come later this year.</p> <p>The Big Three auto makers are fighting the move, saying they do not have the technology to produce an electric with an attractive range and an attractive price. If electrics eventually catch on, some experts think most are likely to be assembled by the car companies that dominate the market today. But electrics would not need many of the components of today&#39;s cars, including some, like internal-combustion engines, that the big car companies specialize in producing.</p> <p>A showcase for the state of the electric art will be the Los Angeles Auto Show, which opens next week, and will feature environmentally benign cars from a variety of makers. The electrics on display will include General Motors&#39; Impact and a host of vehicles from smaller companies. For example, U.S. Electricar, a small manufacturer in Athol, Mass., will display a 22-foot bus and a dump truck.</p> <p>One of the most intriguing cars in that show is a &quot;concept car&quot; designed to run on a flywheel, a type of battery that is mechanical instead of chemical.</p> <p>The car, produced by American Flywheel Systems Inc. of Bellevue, Wash., takes its basic shape from a Chrysler New Yorker, but without the engine, transmission, radiator, starter motor, gas tank, muffler and -- crucial from California&#39;s point of view -- tailpipe. It is also designed to use fiberglass or aluminum in place of steel in the body panels, plus a flywheel battery and the electric motor. The result weighs 2,583 pounds, which is 957 pounds less than the gasoline version. It is also more than 300 pounds lighter than the G.M. Impact, although the Chrysler sedan seats four and the Impact only two.</p> <p>The car, the AFS20, has some notable design features, including an undercarriage as smooth as the top, to reduce wind drag.</p> <p>&quot;Concept car,&quot; though, means it does not actually run. American Flywheel Systems has a prototype flywheel battery powerful enough to run a color television set and a videocassette player that plays the company&#39;s promotional tape. The company&#39;s partner, Honeywell, which has long experience with a related technology, gyroscopes for satellites, is working on a flywheel powerful enough to run the car.</p> <p>The idea is to use household electrical current to set the flywheel spinning, and after being &quot;charged&quot; in this manner, the wheel would continue spinning on its own for an extended period. When needed, the wheel&#39;s energy can be tapped to generate electricity.</p> <p>The company&#39;s chairman and chief executive, Edward W. Furia, predicted that in 1994 his company would beat the existing speed record for the rim of a spinning flywheel, currently 1,400 meters a second (or more than 3,100 miles an hour), held by the Oak Ridge National Laboratories.</p> <p>The drive train, with a 136-horsepower electric motor, comes from Al Cocconi of AC Propulsion, who worked on the drive train of the Impact before leaving to form his own company. Assuming the flywheel performance that American Flywheel Systems anticipates, the car would accelerate to 60 miles an hour in 6.5 seconds. That compares with an acceleration time of 9.1 seconds for the gasoline version. It would also have a longer range between refuelings -- 371 miles versus 320 for the gasoline-powered Chrysler and just over 100 miles for the Impact. American Flywheel estimates that its car would sell for $30,000, the same as the conventional Chrysler.</p> <p>The car does not exist in its entirety and will not be ready for testing until sometime in 1995, but could reach the market in 1998, Mr. Furia said. Mr. Bradley, among others, says it seems promising.</p> <p>Mr. Furia said that he wanted to display his car at the Detroit Auto Show, which takes place this week, but that he was turned away.</p> <p>General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, meanwhile, continue to lobby hard against the 1998 electric-car sales quota. In 1993 they signed up with Oak Ridge and the Department of Energy&#39;s other nuclear weapons laboratories to research and, if possible, build a supercar that would get 60 miles a gallon at reduced pollution levels.</p> <p>That supercar, if it is built, is also likely to be an electric, or at least an electric hybrid, because electrics can recapture the energy of braking, adding to efficiency. They can also draw at least some of their energy from the generating station of the local electric utility company, whose power plant is, on average, far cleaner than gasoline automobiles based on each unit of energy produced.</p> <p>Correction:  January 28, 1994, Friday</p> <p>An article in the special Outlook &#39;94 issue of Business Day on Jan. 3, about the development of electric cars, misstated the headquarters location of U.S. Electricar/Solar Electric Engineering Inc. The company is based in Sebastopol, Calif., not Athol, Mass.</p>
297938>Federal Panel Recommends Temporary Sites for A-Waste Facing lengthy delays in establishing a permanent storage site for highly radioactive waste from the nation&#39;s nuclear power plants, a Government commission yesterday recommended setting up two small temporary locations.  <p>But Congress, which created the commission in 1987 to study the issue, has explicitly rejected establishing a temporary waste site until a permanent repository is licensed. And the commission said a temporary site chosen so late would have only limited usefulness.</p> <p>Efforts to establish a permanent site have nearly come to a halt because of management problems at the Energy Department. In the past, states and local governments have vigorously resisted playing host to a temporary site if the development of a permanent repository does not seem ironclad.</p> <p>What will now happen to the 2,000 metric tons of nuclear waste produced each year is not certain. Almost all the nuclear waste ever created since atomic power reactors began operating some 30 years ago is still at the plants, stored in pools. Many of these will reach capacity before a permanent repository can be built. Delay on Repository</p> <p>Under a contract with the utilities, whose reactors make the waste, the Energy Department collects a tenth of a cent per kilowatt hour of electricity that is made with nuclear power. The department is obligated to begin accepting the waste by 1998, but has already announced a delay until 2003 in opening a permanent storage site, which it hopes to build at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, and is expected to announce a further delay.</p> <p>The commission&#39;s recommendation for temporary sites does not seem much of a priority for the utilities. A 1982 law, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, gives them until Dec. 31 of this year to petition the Energy Department if they want the Government to store their wastes on a temporary basis. None have done so yet, and none are expected to.</p> <p>Utilities that are running short of space in their spent-fuel storage pools - essentially earthquake-proof swimming pools in which the water is filtered and cooled - have been buying dry storage casks and setting the casks outdoors, near the reactor buildings.</p> <p>Environmentalists favor leaving the wastes there until the permanent repository is built because they see no point in handling highly radioactive material more often than necessary. They therefore criticized the commission&#39;s recommendation that two temporary repositories be built.</p> <p>If spent fuel is kept in casks at the reactor where it was used, &#39;&#39;you don&#39;t have to build an extra facility, and you don&#39;t have to haul it across the country,&#39;&#39; said A. Leon Lowery, a lobbyist for Environmental Action.</p>
651230>NATION CONSIDERS MEANS TO DISPOSE OF ITS PLUTONIUM In 16 unremarkable concrete bunkers built by the Army for a war with Hirohito and Hitler, the United States has begun assembling about 50 tons of plutonium, one of the most expensive materials ever produced and perhaps the most important to safeguard. The Energy Department says the bunkers, each about the size of a two-car garage, are going to be used for interim storage, meaning six or seven years. But plutonium, which was invented by the Energy Department&#39;s predecessor, the Manhattan Project, may turn out to be the hardest thing on earth to dispose of. And at the Energy Department, &quot;interim&quot; can have an elastic meaning. &quot;Immediate&quot; tends to mean several years. &quot;Several years&quot; can mean never.  <p>The Energy Department stopped making plutonium for bombs in the 1980&#39;s, but the stockpile of it is growing because the United States is now dismantling obsolete nuclear warheads. No Easy Answers</p> <p>On Sept. 27 President Clinton announced the formation of an inter-agency task force to consider how much plutonium the nation needs in the post-Soviet era, and how to dispose of what is surplus.</p> <p>The Energy Department is also drawing up a plan for its far-flung weapons production complex for the next century and an environmental impact statement for the whole weapons program. The National Academy of Sciences is also studying the question. But officials are choosing among a short list of unattractive options.</p> <p>&quot;I don&#39;t think people have a really good answer for what is going to happen to the plutonium,&quot; said Rich Loghry, general manager of the Texas plant where the nation&#39;s plutonium is being stockpiled.</p> <p>One hurdle is psychological; the Energy Department cannot bring itself to think of its invention as waste.</p> <p>Developing a consensus may take years, and in the meantime there is &quot;interim storage.&quot; Comparisons With Gold</p> <p>Storage, in fact, may be the leading option, but even this is tricky. Plutonium loses half its radioactivity every 24,000 years, so it will reach background levels of radioactivity in 10 &quot;half-lives,&quot; or 240,000 years; the American political system is focused largely on problems that can be solved in less than four.</p> <p>In the short term, storage at the Pantex plant near Amarillo, Tex., is affordable. Pantex&#39;s annual operating budget is only $210 million, much of it for security.</p> <p>Plutonium is more expensive than gold, though the cost of an ounce is difficult to calculate since the price includes the cost of production cleanup and that has not yet been paid. Tens of billions of dollars will be required to clean up messes in South Carolina and Washington State that were left behind by plutonium production.</p> <p>Plutonium is more important to safeguard than is gold; stolen gold cannot blow up a city. If the United States wanted to contrast the relative importance of these materials, it might put the plutonium at the center of Fort Knox, and leave the gold at the periphery, to distract thieves.</p> <p>But what is plutonium&#39;s value? Department officials say the material has tremendous energy value, and that is true. A recent study for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said that 50 tons of plutonium could be diluted to provide one-third of the fuel for seven large civilian reactors that now run on uranium, and that it would take 20 years to use up. The Public&#39;s Perception</p> <p>That is almost too long, since most of the reactors now running are nearing the end of their economic lives and are likely to be retired in 20 years.</p> <p>But the nation&#39;s utility companies do not even want to discuss taking the plutonium. Executives complain that such discussions only reinforce the public&#39;s association of nuclear power with nuclear war. Besides, lightly enriched uranium, which they use now, is cheap.</p> <p>Also, using plutonium in a reactor licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would mean holding a public hearing, something the utilities view with distaste verging on phobia.</p> <p>But a reactor is the simplest way to actually destroy the plutonium, atom by atom, just the way it was produced.</p> <p>Thomas Cochran, a nuclear weapons expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, noted that it took many years of many reactors running to make the current stockpile. Although heat energy for electricity production would be released, it would still take substantial engineering work to build or modify existing civilian reactors to use the plutonium, and then years of careful operation to consume it.</p> <p>&quot;It takes you exactly the same effort to destroy it as it does to produce it,&quot; Dr. Cochran said. A Poor Track Record</p> <p>The Battelle Memorial Institute, an Ohio-based research and development concern, has proposed finishing two abandoned reactors, the Washington Public Power Supply System plants 1 and 3, with $3.5 billion in privately raised money and letting the Energy Department run them on plutonium; the money would be repaid with electricity sales.</p> <p>Such a plan would hold down the number of places where plutonium had to be stockpiled, but the costs and demand for power are uncertain.</p> <p>Also, the department has chalked up a poor track record lately on its management of complicated projects, from the Clinch River Breeder Reactor in Tennessee to the weapons plants to the Superconducting Supercollider in Texas. Congress does not seem likely to write a blank check for the project, especially to the Energy Department.</p> <p>Although reactors would not destroy all the plutonium loaded in them as fuel, they would greatly reduce the risk of proliferation, since the fission products created as the plutonium is split are intensely radioactive and thus would be too dangerous to steal.But at the moment, there is no permanent storage for spent fuel either, so the effect would be to solve the problem of the accumulating stockpile by vastly increasing the radioactivity of waste that must still remain in human custody until a repository is built. And no one knows where that will be.</p> <p>The plutonium could also be mixed into glass, , which is what the Energy Department plans to do with the tens of millions of gallons of toxic, radioactive liquid wastes left over from plutonium production at the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C., and the Hanford reservation, near Richland, Wash. Mixed in glass with the wastes, the plutonium would be far too radioactive to be easily retrieved for weapons use by terrorists.</p> <p>Three years ago, the department dedicated a vitrification plant at Savannah River, but because of technical problems, it has yet to operate. Mr. Cochran, the expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, &quot;The complication is, since the Department of Energy can&#39;t get its act together on the vitrification to begin with, you&#39;re basically hanging this onto a problem that&#39;s not working very well already.&quot; Birds and Barbed Wire</p> <p>Which brings the department back to storage -- the bunkers standing amid the milo and winter wheat of the Texas Panhandle, with sand hill cranes flying overhead and prairie dogs scampering beneath. Each bunker, built to store munitions in World War II, is now covered by dirt and scrubby weeds on three sides; the fourth side is obstructed by huge concrete blocks, called &quot;access denial barriers,&quot; which are moved with heavy-duty forklifts. These protective measures are backed up by guards with M-60 machine guns and so much razor wire that a joke among plant employees is that if half the wire were removed, the place would look like a maximum-security prison.</p> <p>The department says fire, flood and explosion are not significant hazards, either to the bunkers or the disassembly of the nuclear weapons that proceeds them. But others are less sure.</p> <p>Opponents of storage say they do not want to stand in the way of dismantling the bombs and missiles that can cause millions of deaths almost instantaneously, but neither do they want all the remaining risk on their doorsteps.</p> <p>Correction:  November 20, 1993, Saturday</p> <p>A picture caption on Monday about the search for ways to dispose of plutonium described the bunker shown at a plant near Amarillo, Tex., incorrectly. It is being used to test a storage system; no plutonium is stored in the bunker now. An article on Nov. 15 about the retirement of nuclear weapons misstated the origin of plutonium. Physicists manufactured it in 1940 in early work on the atomic bomb, but they did not invent it; it was subsequently detected in nature.</p>
869849>From a Tiny Industry Niche, Help in the T.W.A. Crash The fiery ending of T.W.A. Flight 800 cast a harsh light into various corners of the aviation business. But some key data for investigating the disaster came from a tiny industry niche here that the National Transportation Safety Board never knew existed. The morning after the July 17 disaster, John R. Keller called directory assistance and asked for the New York City headquarters of the F.B.I. &#39;&#39;I have a radar map of the accident,&#39;&#39; Mr. Keller told the agent who answered the phone.  <p>Mr. Keller is vice president of engineering for the Megadata Corporation, which was able to provide air-traffic records of the seconds before and after the Paris-bound Boeing 747 disappeared from radar screens more quickly and flexibly than the Federal Aviation Administration could.</p> <p>The data helped investigators determine which other aircraft in the vicinity had the clearest eyewitness view of the disaster and its immediate aftermath.</p> <p>Tiny Megadata&#39;s role in the investigation highlights a chink in air-to-ground communications that is not widely recognized by the public but is apparent enough to some airline and airport officials, and the company has been able to make a business of plugging the gap.</p> <p>Clients include United Airlines, which uses Megadata&#39;s technology to coordinate ground crews in five cities during the last few minutes of incoming flights -- a period when the F.A.A. limits communications with planes to essential conversations between cockpit and controllers.</p> <p>Other Megadata clients include airports -- though none in metropolitan New York -- whose managers need to know which planes were where and when should disputes arise over noise violations and the like.</p> <p>In essence, Megadata, based in an industrial park near Long Island MacArthur Airport, produces a $250,000 system that eavesdrops on radio transmissions between the F.A.A. and commercial airplanes.</p> <p>Using computers and software more advanced than anything available to Federal air controllers, the Megadata system massages information and converts it to an instant, real-time view of all aircraft and their flight paths within a 150-mile radius. A data base is able to instantly reproduce air-traffic records that might take the F.A.A. days to compile.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s a completely clandestine operation; they don&#39;t even know we&#39;re there,&#39;&#39; said George B. Litchford, an engineer who holds the system&#39;s patent. Mr. Litchford has been licensing the technology to Megadata since 1989. Megadata is thought to be the only company in this business so far. It is hardly a gold-mine business. Megadata, whose stock is thinly traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, has revenue of less than $2 million a year from a range of communications products, and it lost money last year. The shares closed at 50 cents today, down 37.5 cents each, after spiking upward Tuesday on word of the company&#39;s involvement in the plane-crash investigation.</p> <p>Though the National Transportation Safety Board was unaware of Megadata&#39;s existence before the crash, the F.A.A. has known about the company but typically ignored it.</p> <p>Megadata&#39;s services may be useful to airlines for efficiently moving people on the ground, said Bill Jeffers, the F.A.A.&#39;s director of air traffic. But &#39;&#39;it doesn&#39;t have to do with the safe and efficient movement of aircraft,&#39;&#39; which Mr. Jeffers said was his agency&#39;s concern.</p> <p>Yet, in the case of the T.W.A. crash, Megadata&#39;s records proved invaluable to Federal officials.</p> <p>After Mr. Keller&#39;s phone call, safety board investigators and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation went to Megadata&#39;s office to view charts and determine what other aircraft were in position to see the final moments of Flight 800. Eyewitness reports are considered by aviation experts to be extremely unreliable, and the Megadata information helped establish whether the other pilots were in positions to see what they claimed to see.</p> <p>Based on scans from an F.A.A. radar in Riverhead, L.I., Megadata&#39;s charts showed that two aircraft -- an Air National Guard helicopter and airplane -- were indeed in position to have seen the fireball.</p> <p>F.A.A. radar systems of the type used in Riverhead send out pulses of energy that are reflected off metal objects in the sky, creating blips on a screen. The systems also send out electronic queries, asking the identity and altitude of planes with transponders -- special radios that can respond to F.A.A. queries by emitting electronic identification codes a millionth of a second later.</p> <p>Subtracting that microsecond and dividing by the speed of light, the F.A.A. knows the range, or how far away the plane is. By keeping track of precisely where the circular-scan radar beam is pointed when it asks the question, the F.A.A. knows the direction, or bearing, of the aircraft.</p> <p>The system tracks only signals emitted by aircraft; it does not recognize small planes that have no transponders, or other objects in the sky. It would not have seen a missile.</p> <p>Megadata&#39;s system simply eavesdrops. The main components are a receive-only antenna about 5 feet high, which can be miles from the nearest airport, and a work station to process the data.</p> <p>Though the company is searching for more customers, the reason clients have been willing to pay the price for a Megadata system can be traced to the tight F.A.A. strictures on air-to-ground communications.</p> <p>When a plane is below 10,000 feet a &#39;&#39;sterile cockpit&#39;&#39; must be maintained, with no work or conversation not directly related to flying the plane. That includes a ban on talk by crew members to dispatchers at their airlines.</p> <p>For incoming flights, the radio blackout can leave ground crews in the dark about whether a plane will arrive in time to let passengers make connecting flights or whether controllers have put the plane into a low-altitude holding pattern.</p> <p>And even when radio contact is permitted, at higher altitudes, when  several dozen of an airline&#39;s planes are to land within minutes of one another, calling them all would be too time-consuming, Capt. William B. Cotton, United&#39;s manager of air traffic and flight systems, said. And the pilot may not know when he will arrive, Captain Cotton said.</p> <p>United has become Megadata&#39;s largest client, using the systems in Chicago, Denver, San Francisco, Los Angeles and at Dulles International near Washington.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s a very, very clever invention,&#39;&#39; Captain Cotton said. With the click of a mouse, he said, United&#39;s dispatchers can view all planes aloft in the vicinity, or simply all United planes, or focus on a single aircraft. The system gives ground crews an estimated time of arrival that is more accurate than pilots or dispatchers have been able to provide, Captain Cotton said.</p> <p>If a plane is going to be late, United uses the system to decide, for example, whether to hold other planes on the ground to let passengers make their connections. If its plane is in a holding pattern above 10,000 feet, the airline can also tell its pilot how long the wait is likely to be to help decide whether to divert to another airport -- data that the F.A.A. generally does not provide, Captain Cotton said.</p> <p>Airport managers use Megadata&#39;s information mostly to enforce noise-abatement ordinances.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We get complaints all the time,&#39;&#39; said Ron Wilson, a spokesman for San Francisco International Airport, which has used the Megadata system to resolve hundreds of complaints in the last few years.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;People say: &#39;I saw a 747 come over my house at 500 feet. I know it was 500 feet because I could see the pilots. I could read the numbers. I could see the wheels.&#39; &#39;&#39;</p> <p>Using the Megadata work station, Mr. Wilson said airport officials can enter the location and the time and quickly determine the facts. &#39;&#39;We can tell them it wasn&#39;t 500 feet -- it was 3,500 feet,&#39;&#39; he said.</p>
124692>Clause in Texaco Pact Is Questioned Lawyers for shareholders of Texaco Inc. yesterday questioned a key figure in the company&#39;s settlement with the Pennzoil Company on why the plan to bring Texaco out of bankruptcy protects the company&#39;s officers from lawsuits charging mismanagement.  <p>In a deposition, the witness, Charles F. Luce, the chairman of the committee of Texaco&#39;s creditors, said that the idea of protecting the officers and directors of Texaco had come from Pennzoil. He said that Pennzoil believed that indemnifying the officers would help bring a settlement. 15 Lawsuits Pending Texaco is hoping to emerge from bankruptcy in April, and its reorganization plan, as currently written, would extinguish the 15 lawsuits brought by shareholders against the company&#39;s officers and directors for their role in the merger with the Getty Oil Company, which eventually resulted in a $10.3 billion jury verdict against Texaco. The shareholders, as the company&#39;s owners, are seeking damages from its top executives and directors for mismanagement in the Getty acquisition.</p> <p>The reorganization plan calls for a $3 billion payment by Texaco to Pennzoil to settle the claim. Plans that take companies out of bankruptcy generally settle all claims, and this one would extinguish those of the shareholders.</p> <p>Pennzoil won the judgment by convincing a Texas jury that it had a contract to merge with Getty, which Texaco illegally broke up by offering a higher price. Texaco entered bankruptcy when it could not post a bond to appeal the case.</p> <p>A judge in Federal Bankruptcy Court in White Plains is scheduled to begin hearings in three weeks on the Texaco plan. Mr. Luce&#39;s deposition was taken in preparation for those hearings because he was a major figure in designing the $3 billion settlement. Originated from Pennzoil</p> <p>Mr. Luce, in a telephone interview after the questioning yesterday, said that, while he had he had introduced the idea of indemnifying the officers into the reorganization proposal, it had originated with J. Hugh Liedtke, Pennzoil&#39;s chairman, and Baine P. Kerr, another Pennzoil executive. He said they felt that the Texaco directors were unwilling to settle the matter because they feared the lawsuits.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The way Kerr and Liedtke had it figured out,&#39;&#39; Mr. Luce said, Texaco&#39;s executives believed that &#39;&#39;their liability would be as great if they settled as if they lost the whole lawsuit.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Luce said that the Texaco executives were, therefore, inclined to pursue an appeal of the $10.3 billion judgment rather than settle for a smaller sum because an appeal contained the possibility of avoiding all liability. But Pennzoil was frustrated by the lack of progress towards a settlement, he said, and wanted to remove the liability issue as an impediment.</p> <p>Mr. Luce&#39;s deposition was taken in a closed session at at the Manhattan office of the lawyers representing creditors&#39; committee. An &#39;Outrageous&#39; Verdict</p> <p>Mr. Luce said that James W. Kinnear, Texaco&#39;s chief executive, professed to be unconcerned about the stockholder lawsuits. &#39;&#39;We had some big problems, but this wasn&#39;t one of them,&#39;&#39; he said regarding the liability issue. Mr. Luce was the first to propose in court documents that the lawsuits be eliminated as part of the bankruptcy plan.</p> <p>He also said that he thought that the Texas jury&#39;s verdict was &#39;&#39;outrageous,&#39;&#39; and that a court in Delaware or New York, where the stockholder lawsuits were likely to be heard, would probably not rule that Texaco had done anything wrong.</p> <p>In addition, he pointed to a complicated aspect of shareholder lawsuits to cite a tactical reason why such a case would fail. The shareholders&#39; action is technically called a &#39;&#39;derivative&#39;&#39; suit, in which the shareholders act on behalf of the company. In such a case, the actual plaintiff would be Texaco, he said.</p> <p>But for Texaco to sue its officers and directors for breaching the contract between Getty and Pennzoil, Texaco would have to maintain that such a contract, in fact, existed. Texaco has maintained for the four years since it acquired Getty that no such contract existed, Mr. Luce said.</p>
248691>Competing Designs on Shoreham&#39;s Remains DELAY, the tactic that Shoreham opponents used to drive the Long Island Lighting Company into a deal to kill the reactor, has a new champion: the United States Secretary of Energy.  <p>&#39;&#39;If activists can prevent things from being built, by God, I can prevent things from being shut down when it is stupid,&#39;&#39; said Secretary James D. Watkins late last month. Lilco plans to trade Shoreham to New York State for $1 and guaranteed rate increases; the reactor, originally scheduled for completion in 1971, would then be closed.</p> <p>Mr. Watkins acknowledged uncertainty about his powers and even his plans for Shoreham. But in last month&#39;s news conference and in appearances on two television news programs last week, he said he would fight &#39;&#39;every inch of the way&#39;&#39; to get the $5.5 billion reactor running.</p> <p>If the adamantine local opposition made that impossible, mothballing the plant - an option defined by a reporter at the news conference and adopted on the spot by Mr. Watkins as his &#39;&#39;minimum fall-back position&#39;&#39; -would keep it in condition to operate if Long Islanders&#39; fear of it eased.</p> <p>Mothballing cannot be compared to putting a car on blocks for extended storage; it is more like keeping a taxi in the driveway with the meter running.</p> <p>Maintaining Shoreham as it is, ready to run, costs $75 million a year. Besides that, &#39;&#39;you&#39;d have to keep up with the changing requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,&#39;&#39; said Joseph W. McDonnell, a Lilco vice president. According to Charles Komanoff, an energy consultant, nuclear plants of Shoreham&#39;s size typically spend about $50 million a year to meet new Federal regulations and make other improvements.</p> <p>Apart from the cost, Mr. Komanoff said, Lilco would have less incentive to foster conservation or to buy electricity elsewhere if Shoreham was ready in the wings. And if the reactor is eventually to be dismantled - the only solution acceptable to its opponents, who say it is too risky to run because Long Island&#39;s geography and population would make safe evacuation impossible if there was an accident - then mothballing is simply another costly detour.</p> <p>Dismantling Shoreham would cost at least $450 million. Disposing of the contaminated steel and concrete may be a problem, since South Carolina and Nevada are about to limit access to the nation&#39;s only dumps for low-level radioactive waste. Gas-Burning Option</p> <p>Representative George J. Hochbrueckner, in whose district the plant lies, suggested last month that peripheral parts of the complex be used for a natural gas plant. The conversion could salvage at least $80 million of Shoreham&#39;s value, he said, and could save two years in constructing a gas-burning plant. Getting fuel, however, would take some finagling; a major natural gas pipeline from Canada is supposed to be completed in 1991, but all its capacity is already under contract.</p> <p>The Energy Secretary, a former admiral with long experience in the nuclear navy, argues that electricity generated by the reactor would mean less need for imported oil and less air pollution from burning oil. At the news conference in Washington, a reporter suggested that granting Shoreham an operating license, despite the deal to kill it, had &#39;&#39;an Alice in Wonderland quality.&#39;&#39; By last week, Mr. Watkins was complaining on &#39;&#39;The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour&#39;&#39; that shutting the completed plant was something out of &#39;&#39;the Alice in Wonderland world.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But Mr. Watkins&#39;s power is limited. His department has tried for years to help Shoreham and the stalled Seabrook reactor in New Hampshire, with little effect. The Energy Department is responsible for promoting nuclear power; it is the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that has licensing power. And even that agency cannot make a plant run.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;A license from us is permissive,&#39;&#39; said Joseph Fouchard, a commission spokesman. &#39;&#39;It says, &#39;You may run, if you meet these conditions.&#39; It does not say you must run.&#39;&#39; Safety Question</p> <p>If Lilco shareholders accept the deal next month, Mr. Watkins is threatening to challenge the transfer of the operating license from Lilco to the state&#39;s Long Island Power Authority, perhaps on the ground that the authority lacks technical competence - an unfamiliar role for a department that is usually trying to answer safety questions about its own nuclear operations. But the actual work of decommissioning the reactor would be done not by the new Long Island authority but by the New York Power Authority, which is licensed to operate two nuclear plants, one of a design similar to Shoreham&#39;s.</p> <p>The Energy Department&#39;s object, no matter what its tactics, is delay. &#39;&#39;They&#39;re playing for time,&#39;&#39; said Edward M. Davis, the president of the American Nuclear Energy Council, an industry lobbying group in Washington. If electricity is in short supply on Long Island this summer, he said, there might be &#39;&#39;an abrupt turnaround&#39;&#39; in public opinion of the plant.</p> <p>Struggling to block the deal, the Deputy Energy Secretary, W. Henson Moore, even suggested that the trustees of the New York Power Authority should turn their backs on Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who appointed them, and refuse to dismantle Shoreham, lest the Nuclear Regulatory Commission take revenge on the authority. The implied threat, made April 13 in testimony to the Senate Energy Committee, has not been echoed by the commission.</p> <p>Lilco, once a quiet, even sleepy utility that nearly went bankrupt from its excursion into nuclear politics, is trying to stay clear of the argument. &#39;&#39;If the settlement goes forward,&#39;&#39; said Mr. McDonnell, &#39;&#39;the state would become owner. They could make the policy decision with the Federal Government. We think it is a public policy decision, and governments are uniquely suited to make those decisions.&#39;&#39;  THE REGION</p>
308233>FEDERAL OVERHAUL YET TO TAKE HOLD AT A-BOMB PLANTS Five months after promising that a new, safety-minded team would take control of the nation&#39;s broken-down nuclear bomb factories, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins finds himself presiding over further decline and still struggling to hire the new managers.  <p>Seven plants have been shut or have suffered setbacks in the last five months, and optimistic talk of accelerated reopenings or speeding up construction has ceased. The department&#39;s political influence is declining: seven governors recently balked at helping it by temporarily storing radioactive waste, even after the department enlisted the White House to help sell the idea.</p> <p>Of 18 top jobs at the department, only 10 have been filled. The Senate has delayed action on the nomination five months ago of Victor Stello Jr. to be the assistant secretary in charge of weapons programs. An acknowledgement of that problem came on Nov. 27 when Mr. Watkins gave a lesser job not requiring Senate confirmation to Mr. Stello on an interim basis. The Armed Services Committee will not take up the original nomination until at least Jan. 22, when Congress reconvenes. Mr. Watkins has said the higher post is a key job to fill before he can begin to turn around his department. Beginning of Recovery Is Seen</p> <p>In an interview on Tuesday, however, Mr. Watkins asserted that the condition of the weapons plants has reached its nadir and will soon begin to recover. &#39;&#39;We have management control,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;For the first time, we have our fragile arms around the department.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Watkins, a retired admiral who was also the head of the national study commission on AIDS, said turning around antique machinery, the &#39;&#39;management malaise and ineptness&#39;&#39; and the 200,000 people who work in the department&#39;s plants was 100 times as difficult as anything he had ever done. He said that compared with the Department of Energy, &#39;&#39;the Navy was a piece of cake.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Watkins said he had also turned his attention to the subject that, after all, gives his department its name: not bombs, but energy. He said, for example, that in two decades a national energy policy could conserve each year an amount of fuel equal to half of what the country will use this year.</p> <p>Critics outside the department say that Mr. Watkins&#39;s problems with the bomb complex are in part circular; that experienced, competent nuclear engineers will be reluctant to work at the Energy Department until the department seems to be moving toward environmentally responsible operations. &#39;Not a Bottomless Pit&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;He needs to show it&#39;s not a bottomless pit, that to work there is not the end of your career,&#39;&#39; said Steve Schwartz, a lobbyist with the environmental group Greenpeace. &#39;&#39;Otherwise, why would anyone at Livermore, Sandia or the private sector want to go and jump into a vat of nuclear waste?&#39;&#39; Lawrence Livermore and Sandia, Government engineering and weapons laboratories, are the home of much of the nation&#39;s nuclear expertise.</p> <p>To help solve his personnel problems, Mr. Watkins asked Congress to approve 250 exemptions from a Federal law that bars former Government employees from taking another Federal job and continuing to collect a pension from the earlier job. The Senate approved but the House did not. If the exemptions had been granted, Mr. Watkins could have brought in experienced workers from the Navy and elsewhere who are collecting pensions.</p> <p>Bringing in better personnel is crucial as the department moves toward cleanup. Outside critics say that without the proper expertise, the department is likely to squander millions of dollars and create unsafe conditions.</p> <p>For example, waste tanks at the Hanford nuclear reservation near Richland, Wash., hold a chemical that was added 30 years ago to foster a desired chemical reaction but could cause an explosion if heated enough, an environmental group near the reservation disclosed recently.</p> <p>But Dr. Arjun Makhijani, an analyst at the group, the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, who has studied the department for years, noted that the use of this chemical was so secret that it was apparently unknown even to the officials who drafted the department&#39;s five-year cleanup plan, released earlier this year. That plan speaks of mixing contents of the tank with molten glass to solidify them, a task that would involve heating the chemical beyond its critical temperature. &#39;A Penchant for Secrecy&#39;</p> <p>The problem, Dr. Makhijani said, is &#39;&#39;the lack of scientific integrity and the related penchant for secrecy,&#39;&#39; even in the department&#39;s new era of self-criticism. In fact, some members of Congress have complained that the department has become less communicative lately, and reporters have found some officials less willing to talk in recent months.</p> <p>While Mr. Watkins struggles with his personnel problems, the weapons plants continue to decline, as years of neglect take their toll. Among the additional symptoms to surface in recent months are these:</p> <p>* Two nuclear processing factories in Idaho, on which the department has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the last few years, will be closed for many months because it was discovered that single-shelled pipes carrying highly radioactive and poisonous wastes are buried underground without any protection against leaks, in violation of antipollution laws.</p> <p>* The department, after spending $200 million, closed the doors on a factory at its Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C., where it planned to make submarine fuel to replace a 31-year-old plant in Irwin, Tenn. Because of design problems, engineers could not make the new one run properly.</p> <p>* A factory for the chemical processing of nuclear bomb fuel at Hanford was shut for safety reasons last December, but Congressional leaders who oversee the bomb program found out only in July.</p> <p>Tuesday evening, in an office decorated with hard hats from several Energy Department plants, Mr. Watkins gave a 45-minute interview in which he spoke from hand-written notes about what he had sought to do since coming to the department and where he saw efforts beginning to bear fruit. A command-minded manager whose two immediate predecessors were trained as a lawyer and a dentist, Mr. Watkins took a combative tone in speaking of calls by members of Congress for shutting plants for safety reviews.</p> <p>But progress is coming, he said, particularly at places like the Savannah River Site, the nation&#39;s only source for tritium, a perishable ingredient of nuclear weapons, and at Rocky Flats, the only plant for making the plutonium triggers for thermonuclear bombs. Both those plants were &#39;&#39;a classic Three Mile Island case waiting to happen,&#39;&#39; he said. Mr. Watkins dismissed the contractor at Rocky Flats, resulting in the first departure of a private manager from a Government-owned facility before its contract was up. And both Rocky Flats and Savannah River are in the midst of substantial management changes. Schedules Called Unsound</p> <p>At Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where the Government hopes to store spent fuel from military and civilian reactors, and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, near Carlsbad, N.M., for plutonium-contaminated wastes, &#39;&#39;the whole set of schedules was not scientifically sound, not fiscally sound, not technically sound,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;They were incomplete, misleading and not properly done.&#39;&#39; Now schedules have been pushed into the future, but the job will be done right, Mr. Watkins said.</p> <p>When he took office, he said, he was &#39;&#39;appalled&#39;&#39; to find that many plants were not in compliance with Federal anti-pollution laws because they were relying on a legal doctrine that bans suits against the Government without its consent. A Federal district judge ruled in 1984 that the principle could not be used to shield the department&#39;s plants, but the application of that ruling is still being decided.</p> <p>Mr. Watkins is also seeking to shake up the headquarters operation. &#39;&#39;In this building, program management, as a concept, did not exist,&#39;&#39; he said. Almost all the department&#39;s work is done by contractors, and Mr. Watkins complained that when he arrived, no one could identify who in the department was responsible for a given contractor operation. Protecting Whistle-Blowers</p> <p>In another initiative, he said, the department will soon issue rules to protect lower-level employees who make allegations about safety, competence or the honesty of their superiors. &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve been totally unresponsive to whistle-blowers,&#39;&#39; he said. Speaking of Rocky Flats, where the Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into charges of illegal midnight burning and dumping poisons, he said, &#39;&#39;If we&#39;d been listening, we would probably never have had the F.B.I. raid.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Some whistle-blowers have contended that after bringing charges against their superiors, they were made to undergo psychiatric evaluations.</p> <p>Mr. Watkins also had little use for some of his critics, or the suggestion that his department is having communications problems. Last month, for example, Representative David E. Skaggs, whose Denver district includes Rocky Flats, met with Mr. Watkins and other top officials to ask that part of the complex be briefly closed for safety evaluation, and later complained publicly that the department had refused to do so. But later, the department said that many of the operations about which Mr. Skaggs had complained had actually been shut several days earlier.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We did not shut down that plant for safety reasons,&#39;&#39; he said, describing the curtailment of some operations as part of the process of changing contractors. If the reason had been safety, he said, the shutdown would have come earlier.</p>
864065>2 Killed in Jet On Runway After Engine Breaks Apart A mother and son were killed this afternoon on a Delta Air Lines jet in Pensacola, Fla., when an engine on the plane broke up as it was preparing to take off, sending debris into the cabin. After the takeoff was aborted, at least five other people were injured while being evacuated from the jet, which was bound for Atlanta. The plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-88 filled to capacity with 142 passengers and a crew of 5, was accelerating to take off when passengers reported seeing smoke from the left engine when the plane was about 1,500 feet down the runway.  <p>The dead were identified as Anita S. Saxton and Nolan Saxton, 12, of Scottville, Mich. No age was available for Anita Saxton.</p> <p>Brenda Menard, a passenger on the flight, No. 1288, told The Associated Press that a piece of the engine burst through the fuselage.</p> <p>&quot;There was part of it that went through to the other side,&quot; said Mrs. Menard, who was traveling with her husband, Jean Paul, and their 11-month-old child.</p> <p>Other passengers described what they said sounded like an explosion or &quot;pop&quot;  and an odor like burning plastic.</p> <p>Bruce Yelverton, director of Escambia County Emergency Medical Services, said the five who were injured were taken to Pensacola hospitals, including a 15-year-old boy and his 9-year-old sister. A pregnant passenger was also taken to a hospital.</p> <p>One of the injured was evacuated by helicopter and was in serious condition,  Mr. Yelverton said. The others were listed in good condition.</p> <p>The engine, a Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-219, was similar, but newer and larger, than one that broke up on a Valujet DC-9 as it was taking off from Atlanta in June 1995, badly injuring a flight attendant. After that accident, the National  Transportation Safety Board called for more frequent inspections of engines like the one in the Valujet accident, JT8D-9a&#39;s, that had been serviced by the company from which Valujet got the engine. The board also called for tighter inspections of other JT8D engines.</p> <p>On Jan. 30, a JT8D engine failed on a Delta Boeing 727 during takeoff at LaGuardia Airport in New York, throwing parts through the engine cowling, the board said. The takeoff was aborted and no one was hurt.</p> <p>After that incident the safety board recommended that the F.A.A. require certain JT8D&#39;s to be inspected for cracks. Mark Sullivan, a spokesman for Pratt  &amp; Whitney, said the recommendation did not cover the type of engine in today&#39;s accident, and that the parts to be inspected were not involved in the Pensacola  accident.</p> <p>Mr. Sullivan said the company believes a fan blade in the front of the left engine failed in today&#39;s accident.</p> <p>Broken pieces of the blade probably penetrated the fan case and debris went flying, Mr. Sullivan said.</p> <p>&quot;We believe that is what happened,&quot; he said. &quot;But we have not confirmed it because we haven&#39;t examined the engine.&quot;</p> <p>Delta could not say this evening when the engine that broke up today was last inspected, or how old it was. But a spokesman, Dean Breest, said it was probably about the same age as the aircraft, which was delivered to the airline in 1988.  Both the MD-88 that was involved in the accident today and Valujet&#39;s DC-9 have engines mounted close to the fuselage at the rear of the plane. They are centered just below the middle of the passenger window. The National Transportation Safety Board said this evening that it was sending a team of six investigators to the scene.</p> <p>Michael Benson, a spokesman, said that &quot;uncontained engine failures,&quot; in which the spinnning internal parts not only break up, but break out of the engine, are rare but are &quot;one of the worst things that can happen.&quot; Such failures usually occur at takeoff, when the engine is strained to its maximum. In the Valujet case, the debris severed fuel lines, which started a fire that destroyed the airplane. There was no widespread fire in today&#39;s accident.</p> <p>Accidents involving JT8D&#39;s are relatively rare, given that the engine is one  of the most popular in commercial aviation. At least 30 passengers on today&#39;s flight were evacuated using slides, others used stairs.</p> <p>One passenger Ernie Lazos, a podiatrist from Medford, N.J., said the pilot had just made preliminary announcements when &quot;you just heard this pop.&quot; He went  on: &quot;Just at that moment, I turned around and the guy in the back says there&#39;s smoke. I guess there was a panic.&quot;</p> <p>He said he tended to a young girl who had a fractured leg and a deep gash in  her face..</p> <p>Kathy Pope, dispatch supervisor for Escambia County Emergency Medical Services, said the girl was taken to a local hospital. Her condition was not immediately available.</p>
837925>2 BUILDERS CHOSEN FOR SPEEDY TRAINS ON NORTHEAST RUN Taking a decisive step in its ambitious plans to upgrade train service in the Northeast and give the airlines a run for their money, Amtrak today chose the contractors to build a $611 million fleet of &quot;American Flyers&quot; that would cut the time of train service between Washington and Boston by two hours. The top speed of the new trains, 150 miles an hour, is 25 miles an hour faster than trains now travel between New York and Washington, and 50 miles faster than between New York and Boston.  <p>Amtrak is ordering 18 &quot;train sets,&quot; each consisting of six cars and an engine at either end. Each of the 345 seats on the trains will have an electric  outlet for a laptop computer.</p> <p>The trains will be built by Bombardier Inc., of Quebec, and GEC Alsthom, a French-British venture. But much of the work will be done in Plattsburgh, in the northeast corner of New York State, and in Barre, in central Vermont.</p> <p>Amtrak officials said they hoped the first train would be delivered in late 1999.</p> <p>The new trains, combined with track improvements planned or under way, will cut travel time from Capitol Hill in Washington to mid-town New York from three  hours, to two and a half hours. That is about the same time as it would take to  get from downtown to the airport, fly on a shuttle and get to the other downtown, &quot;depending on how bad La Guardia is acting,&quot; said Thomas M. Downs, the railroad president.</p> <p>The trip from New York to South Station in Boston will take about three hours, but that is down from four and a half hours now, he said. He said he believed many travelers would be attracted by the new speed and convenience of the train schedule, allowing the railroad to raise prices closer to airline shuttle prices.</p> <p>Both Amtrak and the airlines vary their prices according to time of day and offer discounts to various groups, but the unrestricted weekday fare from New York to Washington on the Amtrak Metroliner is $106; the air shuttle is $160. No one knows now what the prices will be in 1999, when the first of the new trains  is supposed to be delivered.</p> <p>Like the outlets for laptops, phone connections for modems will be available, Mr. Downs said. There will also be provisions for electronic entertainment at each seat. Instead of the cafe cars on the Metroliners, which are memorable among travelers who missed the chance to stop at a takeout shop in the train station, there will be &quot;bistro&quot; cars with improved menus, officials say.</p> <p>&quot;We&#39;re back,&quot; Mr. Downs declared. &quot;Rail passenger service in America is back.&quot;</p> <p>Amtrak says it expects to capture an additional three million riders a year,  up from 11 million now in the Northeast Corridor. Most of the gain will be between New York and Boston, where Amtrak carries only one passenger for every six who take the plane; between New York and Washington the ratio is close to one to one. Not all the gain will come from planes, though; some people will be  lured out of their cars, Amtrak believes.</p> <p>The Metroliners, which were introduced in the 1970&#39;s, will be demoted to Amtrak&#39;s Northeast Direct, or nonexpress, service. That will allow retirement of still older equipment. Amtrak is also buying 15 other new electric locomotives because it is electrifying the rails from New Haven to Boston, which is a major  step in reducing travel time.</p> <p>Amtrak expects the trains to add $150 million a year to its bottom line and move it closer to ending its need for operating subsidies by 2002.</p> <p>The announcement was made today by Vice President Al Gore and the Transportation Secretary, Federico F. Pena, who joked that passengers would be able to send E-mail to Mr. Gore, while they traveled at 150 miles an hour, telling him how great the service was.</p> <p>But Mr. Pena also said that moving passengers out of planes and into trains would reduce airport congestion in the Northeast and therefore around the country, because planes bound to Washington, New York or Boston from other regions would find less air traffic when they got there.</p> <p>Mr. Pena also said that President Clinton&#39;s budget for next year, which is to be released next week, will include $80 million for the new trains and $200 million for improving the tracks.</p> <p>Just as General Motors finances car purchases, Bombardier and GEC Alsthom will provide financing for much of the deal, evidently believing that the trains will generate more than sufficient revenues to pay for themselves. Bombardier and GEC Alsthom plan to borrow the money from banks at preferential rates, because the loans will be guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank, according to Bombardier.</p> <p>The new trains accelerate and decelerate faster than existing trains, Amtrak  said. Their top speed is still 50 to 100 miles an hour slower than some trains in Europe and Japan, but Mr. Downs said their ride would be smoother. It will also be quieter, he said, in part because the trains will be pressurized, like airliners, at a pressure higher than the outside atmosphere.</p> <p>The two companies appear to have faith that their equipment will perform as designed, because the contract, which includes service for 20 years, provides stiff penalties for mechanical failures. The trains are allowed one breakdown for every 400,000 miles of operations, which equals roughly nine breakdowns a year. Beyond that, they will pay a $5,000 penalty if a train is more than 15 minutes late because of mechanical breakdown. If a train cannot begin its daily  run on time because of mechanical problems, there is a $10,000 penalty.</p> <p>In addition, if there is more than one failure of an onboard system in 120,000 miles of operations -- like the lights, air-conditioners, public address system or toilets -- the companies will pay $1,000 per failure.</p> <p>And if the trains cannot accelerate enough or take corners fast enough to meet the schedule, there will be one-time penalties that could run into the tens of millions of dollars.</p> <p>The equipment contract comes to $754 million, and with maintenance, comes to  $864 million, Mr. Downs said. Amtrak, whose formal name is the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, will require that more than half the equipment work be done in the United States. Peter Stangl, the president of the Bombardier Transit Corporation, said that far more than 50 percent would be done in this country, mostly at Bombardier plants in Plattsburgh and Barre, although the car bodies would be built in La Pocatiere, Quebec.</p> <p>The whole project will generate 6,000 jobs, and the potential subcontractors  are in 20 states, officials said.</p> <p>The Bombardier consortium beat Siemens A.G., a German company, in the last round of competition. There was no competitor from the United States. GEC Alsthom is a venture of the General Electric Company of Britain, which has no connection with the American G.E., and Alcatel Alsthom of France.</p>
387564>White House Objects to Bills on Cleaner Fuel The White House has decided to oppose both the House and Senate versions of plans to make oil companies provide cleaner-burning gasoline. Those requirements are a centerpiece of proposed revisions to the Clean Air Act.  <p>In a letter dated Friday, the White House, which had not expressed a public position beyond saying that any new requirements should be worth the cost, said, &#39;&#39;Both the House and Senate reformulated gas provisions are needlessly inflexible and present enormous implementation problems.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Both houses had approved unusually specific legislation about what steps would be required, reflecting frustration over past laws that had failed to achieve the anticipated progress.</p> <p>The letter, addressed to Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, continued, &#39;&#39;Unless these provisions are changed, they will result in unnecessary increases in the price of gasoline to consumers and in potential supply disruptions, without producing commensurate environmental benefits.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The letter was signed by the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, William K. Reilly, the Secretary of Energy, James D. Watkins, and the President&#39;s assistant for economic and domestic policy, Roger B. Porter.</p> <p>Passage Further Complicated</p> <p>The letter does not explicitly mention a veto, but it concludes that the signers &#39;&#39;look forward to working with you to produce a bill that the President can endorse.&#39;&#39; The letter would appear to further complicate passage of a new bill, which would be the first major amendment to the 20-year-old act since 1977. The bill has been before a conference committee all summer.</p> <p>Air pollution experts say reformulated gasoline is a particularly important step to achieve progress quickly. William Sessa, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, said that requiring changes in automobile emissions would also help, but he said: &#39;&#39;Emission standards reduce emissions from cars yet to be built. Cleaner gasoline affects emissions from all cars on the roads.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But the letter said: &#39;&#39;It is simply inappropriate and needlessly expensive to specify a formula for gasoline in the statute, because technology and markets move in ways that cannot be easily anticipated. If it is not possible to eliminate the formula from the bill, at a minimum the conference should include flexible language allowing fuels that provide equivalent benefits to be used in lieu of the mandated formula.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The oil industry has raised similar concerns and has lobbied hard against the provisions.</p> <p>Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is a leading proponent of the gasoline provisions, called the White House&#39;s position &#39;&#39;unbelievable.&#39;&#39; Reducing pollution by changing gasoline is far cheaper than reducing it by other means, he said, and the White House&#39;s position is &#39;&#39;not good for the environment and it&#39;s not good for the economy.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>House staff members said the House version was not overly restrictive. At the urging of the oil industry, staff members said, the House had drafted a law that would allow oil companies to use either the House&#39;s recipe for gasoline or any equally clean gasoline.</p> <p>The House and Senate took different approaches, but set specifications for the levels of certain kinds of hydrocarbon compounds in gasoline and the oxygen content. Oxygen is present in methanol, alcohol and other combustible liquids that can be added to gasoline, promoting fuller combustion. But it can also result in increased production of nitrogen oxides. And by some estimates, the additives required under the bill would be in very short supply and would have to be imported.</p> <p>The Administration estimated that the reformulation provisions would cost the oil industry an average of at least $3 billion annually between 1992 and 1994 and raise gasoline prices by at least six to eight cents a gallon.</p>
363748>SAFETY IS AN ISSUE AT ATOMIC PLANT Government memorandums show that top officials of the Federal Energy Department are still giving production of nuclear weapons a higher priority than safety, an influential Congressman says.  <p>The Congressman, Representative John D. Dingell, complained in a June 6 letter to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins that two officials had agreed that the Rocky Flats weapons plant near Denver, which the department owns, should be restarted before new measures to prevent losses of plutonium there are adopted.</p> <p>Mr. Dingell&#39;s letter quoted from a May 10 memorandum by Robert M. Nelson Jr., the manager of the department&#39;s Rocky Flats office. In the memorandum Mr. Nelson said he was &#39;&#39;unwilling to put significant additional resources toward security improvements&#39;&#39; before the plant was reopened.</p> <p>Mr. Nelson&#39;s memorandum was addressed to Victor Stello Jr., who is in charge of the Energy Department&#39;s weapons plants. Mr. Dingell&#39;s letter quoted Mr. Nelson as saying, &#39;&#39;We are overrunning funding on mandatory work for resumption&#39;&#39; of bomb production, and &#39;&#39;we cannot take people from other work without affecting resumption.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Plant Closed Since 1989</p> <p>Rocky Flats makes hydrogen bomb triggers, essentially small atomic bombs. It has been shut since last year because of safety problems. Auditors there recently discovered that enough plutonium had been lost in ventilation ducts to make fuel for seven nuclear bombs.</p> <p>But fixing the security problems now would give the contractor that operates the plant, EG&amp;G of Wellesley, Mass., an excuse to delay reopening the plant, according to a memorandum by Mr. Nelson quoted in the Dingell letter.</p> <p>&#39;Bureaucratic Games&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee&#39;s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, asked for information on the department&#39;s &#39;&#39;knowledge of the safeguards and security situation at Rocky Flats&#39;&#39; on the date of Mr. Nelson&#39;s memorandum. Mr. Dingell&#39;s letter, noting that Mr. Nelson had called for an evaluation of plant security by another Energy Department office, said, &#39;&#39;The consequences of a security incident at Rocky Flats are far too great&#39;&#39; for the department &#39;&#39;to be playing bureaucratic games.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A spokesman for the subcommittee said yesterday that no answer to the letter had been received.</p> <p>Beth Brainard, a spokeswoman for the department at Rocky Flats, said this evening that Mr. Nelson planned to wait for a report from another office of the Energy Department before considering changes in the plan to reopen the plant. EG&amp;G has said some parts of the plant would be ready for a pre-opening inspection by July 1.</p> <p>Referring to Mr. Watkins, Ms. Brainard said: &#39;&#39;The Admiral has said we will not resume operations until it is safe to do so. He has made that very clear. If the schedule has to slip for safety reasons, then the schedule slips.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Stello was the top staff official of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which regulates civilian reactors. Mr. Watkins chose him to be Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs, with the assignment to restore Rocky Flats and other closed weapons plants to operation. But Mr. Stello recently asked that this nomination be withdrawn because of a controversy about his work at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Earlier this week the Energy Department&#39;s inspector general said he had sent the Department of Justice evidence that Mr. Stello had given false information to Congress.</p> <p>Mr. Stello is now Deputy Assistant Secretary for Facilities, a post that does not require Senate confirmation.</p> <p>An Energy Department statement yesterday said the inspector general&#39;s report did not raise any new charges.</p>
410142>U.S. Is Left Without Law To Cover Oil Emergencies For the first time in 40 years, the Federal Government finds itself without emergency authority to allocate supplies of oil among civilian users. The law that gave the Government the authority to decide who would get priority for scarce oil or oil products, the Defense Production Act of 1950, expired on Oct. 20 without Congress acting to extend it.  <p>A proposed renewal of the bill was delayed because some members of Congress were trying to add a domestic-content provision on manufactured goods, and the Pentagon opposed it.</p> <p>If a war in the Persian Gulf created shortages in the United States like those of 1973 or 1979, most states could exercise emergency powers to allocate supplies, and since the beginning of the Middle East crisis many state officials have been making preparations to do so. Some energy officials fear that the result could be a chaotic patchwork of rules that would be worse than no rules at all.</p> <p>The Federal Government would still have some authority in case of crisis, notably to put the armed forces at the head of the gas line. Among civilians, the referee would be the states.</p> <p>The law that Washington used in the last two oil crises, the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, expired in 1981, and the Reagan Administration did not seek to renew it.</p> <p>&quot;We are sorry we lost the authority,&quot; John J. Easton, Assistant Secretary of Energy for International Affairs and Energy Emergencies, said in a telephone interview. &quot;It probably would have been used very sparingly, but at least we knew we had it.&quot;</p> <p>The Energy Department would generally prefer to rely on the marketplace to allocate supplies, he said, but &quot;we realize there are going to be situations of an emergency nature where the Federal Government does need authority. &quot;</p> <p>Mr. Easton said the White House was circulating to various agencies the draft of an executive order that would centralize in the Defense Department the ability of the Government to exercise its remaining authority, primarily to assure energy for the armed forces and companies that supply the armed forces.</p> <p>The Defense Production Act had allowed Washington to perform that function and then, if those allocations created problems in the civilian market, to direct the use of civilian supplies, too.</p> <p>During the Korean War, for example, the Government ordered refiners to maximize production of aviation fuel. Even if the refiners had been willing to cooperate voluntarily, Government officials said, making the change mandatory helped oil companies do so without alienating their commercial customers. Exercise in New Hampshire</p> <p>The most recent exercise of allocation authority was by New Hampshire. In the midst of the sustained cold snap last December and January, with an acute shortage of propane, the state found 100,000 gallons in the hands of an electric utility and arranged for its sale to two retailers that supplied private homes, a nursing home and several factories. State officials also arranged the transfer of liquefied natural gas to the utility to replace the propane.</p> <p>&quot;New Hampshire does not believe in interfering with the market,&quot; said Jonathan S. Osgood, director of the Governor&#39;s Energy Office. But the propane shortage was so severe, he said, that &quot;in this particular case, the market didn&#39;t exist any more.&quot;</p> <p>Approximately 32 states give their governors the authority to allocate supplies or fix prices or both, officials of the National Association of State Energy Officials say. And even if state law does not delegate specific authority over petroleum, &quot;virtually every governor, through the executive order process, could do something,&quot; said Frank Bishop, the executive director of the group.</p> <p>Laws differ from state to state but most give the governor the authority to allocate supplies to emergency services. &quot;It&#39;s not just ambulances and hospitals,&quot; Mr. Bishop said. &quot;You want to make sure that farmers get crops to market, that the mail is delivered, that U.P.S. can run and that Federal Express can run.&quot;</p> <p>Governors could also take such steps as limiting the amount of gasoline or heating oil that customers could buy or instituting rationing systems.</p> <p>In some states, governors have the authority to order oil companies to divert supplies from one part of a state to another, although actions that interfered with interstate commerce could be challenged in court.</p>
1587053>Atomic Waste Disposal Rules Set for Debate By Congress A dispute over whether millions of gallons of radioactive waste can be safely left in aging steel tanks has become an issue in the military authorization bill for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. In contention is an Energy Department plan to let it decide how to handle waste created while making nuclear weapons. The department says it could cut decades off the ongoing cleanup of radioactive waste and reduce the cost by tens of billions of dollars if it left substantial amounts of waste in underground tanks and covered them with a grout.  <p>But environmentalists sued, saying that disposal method was unsafe. Last July a Federal District Court in Idaho, where some of the tanks are located, ruled that a 1982 law requires deep burial.</p> <p>The Energy Department countered by asking Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, to introduce an amendment to the military bill now before the Senate to allow the department to decide how much of the waste can be left permanently in the tanks. Debate on that amendment is expected to be one of the first orders of business when Congress returns on Tuesday.</p> <p>When the bill reached the Senate floor on May 20, just before the recess, Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington State, where more tanks are located, tied up deliberations with a lengthy denunciation of the idea.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;For most Americans, grout is something they see in their bathroom, not something they do with nuclear waste,&#39;&#39; she said. She said that the Energy Department was engaged in a &#39;&#39;sneak attack&#39;&#39; to reclassify the waste to avoid the requirement for deep burial and that this would overturn 30 years of federal policy without public debate.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Who wants to save money by leaving nuclear waste in the ground, where it is leaking into the Columbia River or the Savannah River, or other areas of the country?&#39;&#39; she asked, speaking for about two hours.</p> <p>The Energy Department is seeking to establish a deep-burial site in Yucca Mountain in Nevada, though any disposal there is at best years away. In the meantime, it says the federal ruling, by Judge B. Lynn Winmill of Federal District Court in Boise, Idaho, has left it unable to proceed with any cleanup.</p> <p>Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, said the amendment would allow the Energy Department &#39;&#39;to pursue the best plan to dispose of this nuclear material.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;That plan saves our taxpayers money,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It shortens the amount of time the waste remains in the tanks. It is a safe way to do it. It is a well-thought-out way of doing it and one that has been the subject of a lot of daylight.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Kyle E. McSlarrow, the deputy secretary of energy, said in an interview that the result of the court case, initiated by the Natural Resources Defense Council, was &#39;&#39;paradoxical&#39;&#39; because it was holding up cleanup of the tanks, many of which have already leaked some of their contents.</p> <p>But in his ruling, Judge Winmill described the department&#39;s criteria for reclassifying the waste as based on little more than &#39;&#39;whim.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>At the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C., the Energy Department has already grouted two tanks. Arjun Makhijani, president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, who has been studying environmental problems at Savannah River since the 1980&#39;s, said in a statement: &#39;&#39;There is no experience with grout that can allow containment projections of this magnitude. On the contrary, experience with grout so far has been unsatisfactory.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>He said that if 10 percent of the strontium-90, a prominent radioactive material in the tanks, was left behind and the tanks were grouted, leakage could not rise more than one part in 100,000 per year for a century, or underground water supplies would be contaminated above the current federal drinking water standards.</p> <p>The department and the Natural Resources Defense Council disagree about how to characterize the amount of waste that the department proposes to leave in tanks.</p> <p>Mr. Graham said in an interview that he understood that the states would reach agreement with the Energy Department on what fraction of waste could be left behind. But the text of his amendment does not specify how that would be done.</p>
1728039>Widespread Radioactivity Monitoring Is Confirmed The F.B.I. and the Energy Department have conducted thousands of searches for radioactive materials at private sites around the country in the last three years, government officials confirmed on Friday. The existence of the search program was disclosed on Thursday by U.S. News &amp; World Report, on its Web site. Since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, government agencies have disclosed that they have installed radiation-detection equipment at ports, subway stations and other public locations, but extensive surreptitious monitoring of private property has not been publicly known.  <p>The federal government has given thousands of radiation alarms, worn like cellphones on the belt, to police and fire departments in major cities.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Justice Department, Brian Roehrkasse, confirmed that law enforcement personnel were conducting &#39;&#39;passive operations in publicly accessible areas to detect the presence of radiological materials, in a manner that protects U.S. constitutional rights.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>U.S. News, citing people it did not name, said many of the sites that federal agents had monitored were mosques or the homes or businesses of Muslims, and the report set off a dispute between a Muslim group here and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p> <p>The group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement: &#39;&#39;This disturbing revelation, coupled with recent reports of domestic surveillance without warrant, could lead to the perception that we are no longer a nation ruled by law, but instead one in which fear trumps constitutional rights. All Americans should be concerned about the apparent trend toward a two-tiered system of justice, with full rights for most citizens, and another diminished set of rights for Muslims.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But John Miller, an assistant director of the F.B.I., said in a statement that his agency &#39;&#39;does not target any group based on ethnicity, political or religious belief.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;When intelligence information suggests a threat to public safety, particularly involving weapons of mass destruction,&#39;&#39; the statement said, &#39;&#39;investigators will go where the intelligence information takes them.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Miller said the bureau was &#39;&#39;disappointed at the conclusions&#39;&#39; reached by the Muslim group. He added that F.B.I. agents would work through the holiday weekend to catch whoever set off a bomb on Tuesday that damaged the door of a mosque near Cincinnati.</p> <p>According to a federal official who would not allow his name to be used, the investigators have visited hundreds of sites in Washington, New York, Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas and Seattle on multiple occasions, as well other locations for high-profile events like the Super Bowl. The surveillance was conducted outdoors, and no warrants were needed or sought, the official said, speaking on anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss classified programs.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If you can go drive a car into the parking lot near the shopping mall, we can go there,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s nothing intrusive. We&#39;re not searching into a particular building, just sniffing the air in the area.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Federal officials have expressed anxiety about two radiological threats. One is a &#39;&#39;dirty bomb,&#39;&#39; a conventional explosive that would spread a radioactive material. Such an attack would be unlikely to kill anyone with radiation, but it could contaminate streets, buildings or other public places. The materials that would be used are highly radioactive and might be detected from some distance, experts say.</p> <p>The other threat is that someone would try to detonate a nuclear bomb. Bomb fuel, either enriched uranium or plutonium, is much harder to detect, because its radiation signature is weak, physicists say. But it is also much harder to obtain.</p> <p>At least some of the surveillance was by the Nuclear Emergency Support Team, part of the Energy Department&#39;s National Nuclear Security Administration, which leads the American effort to secure nuclear materials around the world.</p>
406232>Oil Price Drops $4.06 a Barrel; Stocks Move Up Continuing to lurch with each shift in the outlook for war, oil prices took a steep fall yesterday after President Bush called for an exchange of top diplomats with Iraq. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for delivery in January closed at $28.85, down $4.06 a barrel, or 12.3 percent.  <p>Many experts said that with the threat of war temporarily removed, the price would sink lower in coming weeks. But traders said prices seemed likely to gain strength approaching Jan. 15, the deadline set by the United Nations for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.  Still 25% Above Aug. 2 Price</p> <p>&quot;A lot of the war premium went out of the market today,&quot; said James R. Fielder, a trader at E.D.&amp; F. Man International.</p> <p>Still, the price of a barrel of oil stands 25 percent above its level on Aug. 2, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, and more than 70 percent higher than on July 2.</p> <p>Stock traders were also quick to sense hopes for a peaceful solution in the Middle East, with the Dow Jones industrial average jumping 40.84 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,559.65.  [ Page 33. ]</p> <p>While the drop in the price of oil was substantial it was not a record; on Oct. 19, comparable contracts fell $5.41 a barrel.</p> <p>&quot;Most people were expecting the market to hold above $30,&quot; Mr. Fielder said. &quot;When it sold through $30, everyody just jumped in.&quot;</p> <p>Peter C. Beutel, a market analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group of Hoboken, N.J., said the United Nations deadline was more important. &quot;It suddenly dawned on the market that while negotiations were unlikely to do anything, we have a window between now and Jan. 15 in which any military action is almost impossible,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Thus, he added, for the first time since August, &quot;the traders can follow the fundamentals without having to look over their shoulders at a war starting any second.&quot;</p> <p>The &quot;fundamentals,&quot; or balance of supply and demand, favor lower prices, experts agree. George F. Friesen of Deutsche Bank Group said an inventory surplus had been emerging since October. If the surplus continued to build for several months, he said, &quot;it would be enough to send the price of oil into the teens,&quot; a level not seen since mid-July.</p> <p>Price of Oil Products Down</p> <p>The United Nations resolution also pushed down the price of oil products, but they had another reason to decline: the December contract expired yesterday. Thus, those that did not want physical delivery of the heating oil or gasoline -- meaning the vast majority of market participants holding such contracts -- had to sell.</p> <p>Heating oil declined 7.65 cents, to 85.87 cents, and unleaded gasoline was down 5.79 cents, to 77.58 cents.</p> <p>People who buy gasoline at the pump are unlikely to see much effect, however, because of a 5-cent-a-gallon increase in taxes this morning.</p> <p>The crude and product contracts expire at different times, so the peculiar factors that move one generally do not affect the other. But this month was different. The reason was that traders who anticipated a declining price and thus wanted to sell something had only one outlet, crude oil for January delivery, said Ronald B. Caples Jr., a trader at Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>How Traders Sell</p> <p>Generally, traders can &quot;sell&quot; by purchasing contracts that obligate them to deliver oil or an oil product for any month they choose. Early in the day yesterday there was trading in the contracts for the &quot;back months,&quot; or for months beyond the one just ahead, but those all fell by their allowable limits, 4 cents a gallon for products and $1.50 a barrel for crude. So in the afternoon, traders who still wanted to sell switched instead to the market for January crude oil, driving prices down further, he said. The amount that the &quot;spot month&quot; contract can move in a day is not regulated.</p> <p>Mr. Caples described the resulting movement in the crude oil market as &quot;panic selling.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It was a very weird set of circumstances,&quot; he said, and predicted that on Monday some traders would start buying back crude, driving the price higher.</p> <p>Estimates of inventories vary. But Robert W. Cassidy, the executive editor of Global Oil Stocks &amp; Balances, a monthly publication of Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, said global stocks at the end of October were 82 days of supply, not counting strategic stocks. A year ago, he added, the comparable figure was 80 days.</p> <p>Unsold Oil in Tankers</p> <p>&quot;Right now, there is a considerable amount of oil on the water, unsold,&quot; he said. &quot;There is strong evidence of inventories building up at sea right now.&quot; The largest component of that inventory is Iranian oil waiting in tankers, he said.</p> <p>In the meantime, global demand is down because of higher prices and an economic slowdown. Demand in this country was down by about 5 percent in September and October, compared with the same months last year. And Mr. Cassidy said, &quot;In August and September, people got very worried, and there was a lot of pre-emptive buying for winter.&quot; Thus some of the demand that would normally come in December came in September instead.</p> <p>In addition, production is roaring along. The Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm based in Washington, put production in November by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at 22.8 million barrels a day, up from an average of 21.5 million barrels a day last year.</p>
525230>Tech Notes; Closing In on Solar Energy There is no trick to gathering energy from the sun, but at what price? Solar Kinetics Inc. of Dallas, under contract with the Department of Energy&#39;s Sandia National Laboratories, has built a &quot;stretched membrane parabolic dish&quot; to concentrate solar power using something cheaper and lighter than the glass now employed. The latest material is a metal foil about as thick as a good-quality plastic garbage bag, coated with the same material used in children&#39;s helium balloons. The dish makes a rigid connection with the support structure in only one place, at the rim. That rim forms the outside of what looks like a giant bicycle wheel, with the foil hanging between the spokes. The area under the foil is draped with another cover, and a small fan creates a light vacuum inside, to keep the foil rigid.  <p>The dish&#39;s supporting structure can be shipped in pieces shaped like pizza slices, and the membrane, on a sort of outsized rolling pin. The next step in the dish technology is finding a better reflective coating. (Solar Kinetics is now looking at Teflon coated with aluminum or silver.) Then the question in more efficient use of the focused heat to create electricity.</p>
1505619>Report Criticizes NASA&#39;s Shuttle Maintenance and Predicts Further Fatal Accidents Even if NASA corrects the problem that doomed the Columbia, the agency is likely to lose more shuttles before the fleet reaches its planned retirement date of 2020, according to the draft of a study done for the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. &#39;&#39;Given uncertainties about the full set of causes for the loss of Columbia and given unforeseen and unplanned aging issues, it is not obvious that the shuttle system will reach even a 30-year life of useful service,&#39;&#39; says the draft, written by the RAND Corporation. NASA hopes to fly the shuttles for 40 years.  <p>Other studies have concluded that the shuttle fleet is at risk of a high rate of catastrophic accidents. But this examination focuses much more closely on potential safety problems related to the shuttle fleet&#39;s age and is implicitly critical of NASA for not doing everything possible to monitor problems like rust and metal fatigue.</p> <p>The study, by Dr. Jean Gebman, an expert in aircraft aging, cites corrosion and fatigue of aging metal and parts, as well as the general level of reliability of the shuttle fleet. It is based on an older RAND estimate of shuttle risks, updated with the experience of the Columbia crash earlier this year.</p> <p>The study, dated June 29, suggests that NASA needs to get a better grip on some potential age-related problems. For example, it says the agency never performed fatigue testing on the shuttles&#39; wings although the wings are susceptible to cracking because they are flexed during liftoff, re-entry and transport. Metal fatigue occurs with repeated flexing; the civilian aviation industry has been attuned to the problem since the roof of a Boeing 737 operated by Aloha Airlines tore off during a flight in April 1988.</p> <p>Heating on re-entry can also cause strain on materials, according to the report. Even when the shuttle&#39;s thermal protection system works as designed, the study says, &#39;&#39;different parts expand differently,&#39;&#39; creating internal tensions.</p> <p>Dr. Gebman&#39;s draft quotes what appears to be a finding by the accident investigation board -- that NASA has not tested the wings or their subassemblies for fatigue.</p> <p>At NASA, however, Dr. Michael A. Greenfield, the associate deputy administrator for technical programs, said that when the agency was developing its shuttles, in 1979 and 1980, it used the Challenger to test the effects of flexing on the wings. A wing of that shuttle was fitted with 2,000 sensors and bent back and forth to 110 percent of the load it was designed to take, he said. The design life of the orbiter was 100 flights, so the wing was tested to 400 flights, he said. (The accident that destroyed the Challenger on liftoff in 1986 was caused by a faulty seal in its rocket booster.)</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We know the fatigue properties of the materials -- they are very well characterized,&#39;&#39; said Dr. Greenfield, who is co-chairman of NASA&#39;s &#39;&#39;return to flight&#39;&#39; program.</p> <p>Dr. Greenfield said the thermal stresses had also been measured and matched the predictions of engineers during the design.</p> <p>But Dr. Gebman, when he testified before the Columbia accident board in April, made a point of saying fatigue in composite structures was not as well understood as fatigue in metals. This made an impression on Dr. Sheila Widnall, a member of the board. &#39;&#39;I was afraid of that,&#39;&#39; she said at the time.</p> <p>Dr. Gebman&#39;s draft also says NASA has deferred inspections for corrosion, even though standing water had occasionally been found inside the Atlantis (which is still available to fly) and the Columbia after rainstorms. The Columbia and the Discovery have each had corrosion behind the crew cabin, a spot that is hard to inspect and hard to repair.</p> <p>At one time, NASA had a &#39;&#39;corrosion control board,&#39;&#39; but the study said it apparently no longer exists.</p> <p>Al Feinberg, a spokesman for NASA, acknowledged that corrosion inspections and repairs had been deferred at times but said that the corrosion control program itself still existed. Any postponement of an inspection or repair has been made &#39;&#39;only after it has been assessed by engineers and been determined that it&#39;s minor and absolutely no safety issue,&#39;&#39; Mr. Feinberg said.</p> <p>Neither the Challenger accident nor the Columbia one appears to have been caused by aging parts. The Columbia broke apart on re-entry apparently because of wing damage caused on liftoff by a chunk of foam thrown off the external tank. The wing part that the foam hit, a leading edge panel, is known to be susceptible to degradation over time, and the accident board has already complained that NASA is not properly tracking the condition of those panels. But the impact was so severe that it would have damaged even a new panel, board members said.</p>
484344>Bills Seek More Competition in Electricity Market Access to the power transmission grid, a key element of the utilities&#39; monopoly control of the nation&#39;s electric system, is up for grabs for the first time in the history of the industry. As part of the National Energy Strategy package moving through the Congress, a House subcommittee has approved provisions that will require utilities to carry electricity from independent buyers across the utilities&#39; territory to independent sellers, even if the utilities lose electric sales as a result. The version of the bill that the Senate is planning to take up this week does not have the same provision.  <p>But the Senate version would repeal a law concerning who may own power plants, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and many other participants in the electric market are demanding access to transmission in exchange for the repeal.</p> <p>Taken together, these legislative proposals would vastly extend the deregulation of the utilities that Congress started in 1978, opening the transmission system and freeing participants to build power plants.</p> <p>&quot;A key to whether there is any real competition at all is transmission,&quot; said Larry Hobart, the executive director of the American Public Power Association, many of whose members are small utilities that serve commercial and residential customers with power they buy from larger utilities. &quot;If you have an independent power producer, that&#39;s like a dot inside a circle that is the service territory of an investor-owned utility. We&#39;re another dot, outside the circle. Unless you can tie them together with a transmission line, it&#39;s of no use to us.&quot;</p> <p>The producers also seek more competition, arguing that they must be freed from &quot;monopsony,&quot; a variation of monopoly in which there are many sellers but only one buyer. Under the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978, independent producers now sell to the utility in whose territory they are situated at &quot;avoided cost&quot; -- the price that the utility would have to have paid to make the power for itself. Many independent producers think they could do better if they could offer their product more widely. &#39;Just Like the Phone System&#39;</p> <p>The utilities argue that their control of the transmission system is essential to the stability of electric supply. At the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of investor-owned utilities, Mary Kenkel, a spokeswoman, said the demand to open the transmission system came from &quot;a bunch of people wanting to take something without paying for it.&quot;</p> <p>Many investor-owned utilities see no advantage to a proliferation of independent producers, because no one can build power plants more cheaply than they can. But some utilities would like to see more such plants, because they themselves would like to build them, either inside their territories or far afield. That group of utilities is also seeking repeal of the holding company act, which puts onerous regulation on utilities doing business in more than one state.</p> <p>Experts say that opening the transmission system would remove a large part of the monopoly power of utilities, turning transmission lines, now private property, into something akin to common carriers. If the market were thrown open to competitors, the amount of power traded that way might be small, but it would go far toward determining electric prices for everyone. When President Bush proposed the National Energy Strategy earlier this year he called for such open access, and there is substantial support in Congress.</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s got to be opened up, just like the phone system,&quot; said Senator Timothy E. Wirth, a Colorado Democrat. Giving small producers and small utilities more access to transmission would mean big improvements in competition and efficiency, he said.</p> <p>In a possible model for opening the transmission system, in two recent cases courts or regulators have required open access as a condition of utility mergers.</p> <p>Lurking behind both the holding company act, which the Senate bill would repeal, and the transmission access issue is the question of whether the utilities&#39; three traditional roles -- as generators, transmitters and distributors of power -- should be split up.</p> <p>Independent producers say access will create competition that lowers price for everyone. Traditional utilities say that with access, independent producers can go &quot;cherry picking,&quot; stealing away the best customers, like major industrial plants, and leaving the utilities with generating stations with no one to serve, creating &quot;stranded investments.&quot;</p> <p>The cost of those plants will have to be spread among small consumers, they say, who will be captive and heavily saddled. &quot;You&#39;ve built to satisfy all customers equally, and now these customers can go elsewhere, so who pays for all that investment?&quot; said Dick Disbrow, the chairman of American Electric Power, a Midwest holding company. If the cost of idle plants is spread among the remaining customers, he said, the price that the traditional utility must charge will rise further, creating an even bigger cost differential. The Issue of Priority</p> <p>On the other hand, the Public Service Company of Indiana favors transmission access and has proposed opening its system in exchange for the right to sell its surplus power elsewhere at whatever price it can get.</p> <p>&quot;Injecting competition into regulated industries is good public policy,&quot; said James E. Rogers Jr., the company&#39;s chief executive, in a speech in Chicago earlier this year.</p> <p>In between is the position taken by a coalition of 17 large public power agencies, led by Richard M. Flynn, the chairman of the New York Power Authority. In this hybrid, small producers would negotiate for access, and impasses would be resolved by binding arbitration.</p> <p>&quot;The maximum savings from competitive bidding won&#39;t flow to consumers unless all potential power suppliers have a fair shot at the transmission system,&quot; Mr. Flynn said.</p> <p>Among the thorny issues is who should have priority on the system. Should it be the third-party buyer and seller, who want round-the-clock access, or the existing utility customers, who use the system far less but save money doing it? &#39;Economy Transfers&#39;</p> <p>Utilities currently use their lines for unscheduled &quot;economy transfers,&quot; so that if one company has a plant that can produce power for 2 cents a kilowatt-hour but is idle and a neighboring utility is running a plant at a cost of 4 cents a kilowatt-hour, the second utility will shut its plant and buy from the first at a cost of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour. The volume of such transfers increased nearly 20-fold between 1960 and 1985, when a huge difference existed between the fuel costs of oil and coal.</p> <p>Costs have narrowed somewhat since then, but transfers still save consumers $18 billion a year, the investor-owned utilities stress.</p> <p>The system was paid for by those customers through their monthly bills, the investor-owned utilities point out. At the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners in Washington, Michael Foley, an electricity specialist, said, &quot;Given the fact that they paid for that hardware, shouldn&#39;t they get first dibs on any of the power?&quot;</p> <p>The Edison Electric Institute casts it in a somewhat grimmer light. &quot;If access to the system is mandated for a few special interests, the benefits now accruing to the majority of a utility&#39;s customers may be compromised,&quot; it said.</p> <p>Correction:  October 29, 1991, Tuesday</p> <p>Because of a production error, an article in Business Day yesterday about an effort to weaken the monopoly held by the nation&#39;s electric utilities included scrambled passages in some copies. The first 39 lines of the continuation -- beginning &quot;seller, who want round-the-clock access&quot; and ending &quot;to the majority of a utility&#39;s customers may be compromised,&#39; it said&quot; -- should have appeared at the end of the article.</p>
1301245>As Jumbo Jets Grow So Does Loading Time TO air travelers, it may seem that the longest part of any trip comes after the plane has landed and everyone has stood up, waiting for the door to open so they can file out. That period is an impatient time for the airlines, too, because their planes make money only when they are flying. &#39;&#39;Every minute the airplane&#39;s not producing revenue is a pretty high level of cost,&#39;&#39; said Richard F. Marchi, senior vice president for technical and environmental affairs at the Airports Council International, a trade association for airports.  <p>With a giant new plane, the Airbus A-380, scheduled to enter service in five years -- more than 60 have been ordered -- airport planners are thinking hard about the problem. The plane, which will carry 550 people, has a single main door that is slightly wider than a Boeing 747&#39;s, but no major changes in passenger loading, despite being a double-decker.</p> <p>Airbus says the A-380 will be able to be emptied then loaded again in 88 minutes, versus the 83 minutes for &#39;&#39;turning&#39;&#39; the 747-400, the largest commercial plane now, which commonly seats 416 passengers. For the A-380, this period includes 14 minutes to get passengers off, then 23 minutes for boarding.</p> <p>But some of those involved are skeptical, so some radical possibilities have emerged. One would make the airport terminal look more like a train station, with the plane brought into a semi-enclosed space with decks that resemble a train platform.</p> <p>The easy solution would be to use more doors, especially on a two-deck airplane like the A-380. But boarding and debarking from passenger planes has been limited to the left front door, or at most two left-front doors, since the beginning of the jet age.</p> <p>One important reason is the need to use the right side of the plane to load cargo, baggage and food, and to service the lavatory tanks. Loading cargo takes almost as long as loading people, and on big planes, airlines use baggage containers to speed the job, rather than moving the checked baggage suitcase by suitcase.</p> <p>A second problem is the presence of the wings, which effectively block most of the rear half, because of the way they angle back.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There&#39;s been some discussion of trying to use additional doors, but people have tended to stay focused on doors forward of the wing, because it&#39;s so difficult to get a structure to go around the wing,&#39;&#39; Mr. Marchi said. &#39;&#39;The problem is, most of the people are going aft of the wing, so if you have more than one door forward of the wing, you still end up with congestion.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Larry Cox, the chief executive of the airport in Memphis, which is used by at least one airline interested in the A-380, said that he was impressed with the design for handling 747&#39;s at Schipol Airport in Amsterdam. There, passengers wait one flight up from the loading bridge, making it faster to move people out of the plane. But the airline flying A-380&#39;s into Memphis will not have that problem; it is FedEx.</p> <p>Putting a door at the forward end of the upper level is also a problem because the doors cannot be stacked one atop another, Each is equipped with an emergency slide, and if the slides were deployed they would obstruct each other.</p> <p>Putting a loading bridge up to the second deck would then require either crossing over the wing, an idea the airlines do not like because the wings are filled with fuel and vulnerable to anything falling on them, or crossing over the bridge that goes to the forward door, which is a difficult engineering problem because the upper-deck bridge would be unsupported for a long distance.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;No air-jetty manufacturer has yet come up with a scheme to allows you to do it,&#39;&#39; said Garry A. J. Silsbury, a manager at Heathrow Airport who will supervise the handling of super jumbo jets like the A-380. &#39;&#39;If one were available, we&#39;d rush out to buy it.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>John A. Babarovic, a London architect who used to design terminals for American Airlines, recently came up with a double-deck boarding design that is essentially a two-level pier on both sides of the plane under a roof. The lower deck, supported from the floor, extends back as far as the wings. The upper deck is suspended from the ceiling and extends the length of the fuselage.</p> <p>This would allow a plane to have as many as 12 doors, one for every 45 passengers or so, greatly simplifying loading and unloading. A side benefit, he said, is that the plane is out of the weather, so that deicing, which is essential if a plane has been parked at a gate for an hour and it is snowing, would be easier, or unnecessary.</p> <p>But the cost is uncertain, and there are other drawbacks.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We don&#39;t have just one aircraft type using our gates,&#39;&#39; Mr. Silsbury said. &#39;&#39;You want to build your gates with maximum flexibility, so you can cope with a whole range of different types. As soon as you start to lock yourself into the Babarovic design, you lose that flexibility and you build in immense cost.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Babarovic, though, is thinking further ahead. To move ever-larger numbers of people through airports, he said, requires a completely new system. Eventually, airports could have rows of A-380&#39;s all boarding at once, he said, and then the solution might be to run a rapid-transit system under the loading platforms, with passengers using escalators or elevators to board. Passenger movement then would be vertical instead of horizontal, doing away with ever-longer walks down airport concourses.</p> <p>TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT&#39;S REPORT</p>
1845825>Wind Farms May Not Lower Air Pollution, Study Suggests Building thousands of wind turbines would probably not reduce the pollutants that cause smog and acid rain, but it would slow the growth in emissions of heat-trapping gases, according to a study released Thursday by the National Academy of Sciences. The study found, however, that officials who will decide whether to build the turbines have few tools to measure the devices&#39; impact on air quality, on animals like birds and bats, and on wilderness preservation.  <p>In fact, making good decisions about wind energy may be difficult, said David J. Policansky, the study director, because negative effects occur locally while benefits are probably regional or national.</p> <p>The report observed that unlike European countries, &#39;&#39;a country as large and geographically diverse as the United States and as wedded to political plurality and private enterprise is unlikely to plan for wind energy at a national scale.&#39;&#39; But it said developers and local officials got little federal guidance about how to make such decisions.</p> <p>Even the scale of local damage from wind farms is unclear. Bats and raptors are thought to be the animals most threatened by wind turbines because they reproduce more slowly. But scientists base estimates on fairly primitive methods, like counting animal carcasses nearby and hoping that few have been carried off by animals, said Paul G. Risser, chairman of the academy&#39;s study.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If 100 bats are killed, we don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s 100 out of 10 million or 100 out of 100 million,&#39;&#39; Dr. Risser said.</p> <p>And researchers do not know whether newer windmills, which have huge blades that rotate slowly, are any safer for birds and bats than older models, which spin more like airplane propellers.</p> <p>Wind machines can displace power from coal and make electricity without sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and without nitrogen oxides, which add to smog. But the study said they would not reduce the total output of those pollutants because there was already a cap on sulfur emissions and one on nitrogen oxides was likely to follow.</p> <p>Wind power could also reduce coal-plant carbon dioxide, which is thought to cause climate change, but the impact may be small, the report said. By 2025, wind turbines could cut carbon dioxide output by 4.5 percent compared with what it would otherwise have been, but this &#39;&#39;would only slow the increase,&#39;&#39; said Dr. Risser. &#39;&#39;It wouldn&#39;t result in a decrease in the amount of CO2.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The study relied on an Energy Department projection that in the next 15 years, onshore wind capacity would range from 19 to 72 gigawatts, or 2 percent to 7 percent of the nation&#39;s generating capacity. The actual impact would be smaller, however, because wind machines run fewer hours than coal or nuclear plants.</p> <p>Wind output quadrupled from 2000 to 2006, but wind turbines still produce less than 1 percent of the electricity used in the United States. And the amount of wind energy that can be integrated into the electricity grid is limited, the researchers said. The maximum that could be accommodated, Dr. Policansky said, is probably 20 percent of the nation&#39;s electricity use.</p>
1560819>U.S. Seeks Measures on Airline Fuel Tanks The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday that it hoped to propose a rule this fall that would require airlines to take steps to cut the risk of fuel tank explosions like the one that destroyed Trans World Airlines Flight 800. The rule would take effect in 2006, 10 years after Flight 800, a Boeing 747, exploded off Long Island, killing 230 people. It would be phased in over seven years and cover about 3,800 big jets registered in the United States and built by Boeing and Airbus. The agency has developed a system to reduce flammability, but the airlines or airplane manufacturers would be free to use other solutions, said John Hickey, the agency&#39;s director of aircraft certification.  <p>For years after they understood the broad outlines of the cause of the Flight 800 accident -- ignition of the fuel tank by an electrical spark -- regulators discussed a variety of approaches. They considered changing fuel so it would be less prone to turn to vapor, the form in which it is flammable, and pumping inert nitrogen into the empty space in tanks when planes are on the ground. Both ideas were rejected as too expensive.</p> <p>In December 2002, the F.A.A. demonstrated an onboard system that takes compressed air from the engines and runs it through a membrane that sorts the oxygen and nitrogen. The oxygen is dumped overboard and the nitrogen is pushed into the fuel tanks, decreasing the oxygen content to about 12 percent, from 21 percent in normal air.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;re taking this step because we have found a practical solution,&#39;&#39; said Marion C. Blakey, the administrator of the agency. &#39;&#39;Once planes are equipped with inerting technology, we can close the book on fuel tank explosions. It&#39;s a major moment in the safety of aviation.&#39;&#39; The safety repair is unusual in the extent to which the agency used in-house engineering to solve the problem.</p> <p>Airlines might still oppose the step because of its costs. The system would probably cost $140,000 to $220,000 a plane, officials said, plus $14,000 annually for operating costs. Depending on the size of the plane and its fuel tanks, the system will weigh 100 to 200 pounds, and will require the engines to use extra fuel to provide compressed air, Mr. Hickey said.</p> <p>Boeing has said it will use inerting technology in its 7E7, which is still being designed. The F.A.A. would like the new rule to apply to the Airbus A380, which is supposed to fly for the first time this year.</p> <p>Asked why some planes would not be equipped with a preventive system until 2013, Ms. Blakey said the installation could be done only during major maintenance. But she said the F.A.A. had already issued scores of orders for inspecting or replacing wiring or other electrical components to reduce the risk of tank explosion. The agency&#39;s original strategy for guarding against fuel tank explosion was to exclude any possibility of spark, but Ms. Blakey said that with three fuel tank explosions in the last 14 years the agency did not believe that approach was reliable.</p> <p>She added that the fuel tank accidents were occurring at the rate of roughly one every five years. That raises the possibility of another one before a solution is carried out.</p> <p>The chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Ellen Engleman-Connors, praised the decision. Jack Evans, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the trade group for airlines that operate large planes, said the airlines &#39;&#39;certainly support research into fuel inerting systems.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Some of the airlines had hoped that if an inerting system were required rules on electrical safety would be relaxed, but Mr. Hickey said this would probably not be true to any great extent.</p> <p>At the time of the explosion of Flight 800, a Boeing 747 leaving Kennedy International Airport for Paris on a hot July evening, many said that it would be difficult for tanks to explode because the fuel-air mixture had too much fuel, or because the fuel was cold and would not turn readily to a vapor.</p> <p>But tests by the National Transportation Safety Board after the explosion determined that the mixture was often within the range that would sustain an explosion. Flight 800 was delayed on the ground, with its air-conditioners running and giving off their heat to the center fuel tank. As the fuel warmed, its propensity to turn to vapor increased.</p>
261414>As Nuclear Reactors Show Age, Owners Seek to Add Usable Life The nation&#39;s nuclear reactors are getting old before their time, even as their owners say their lives can be extended.  <p>At Indian Point 3 here and at other reactors around the country, important parts that were not supposed to need replacement are aging far faster than the builders expected, forcing extensive repairs.</p> <p>At the same time, the plants&#39; owners, facing public opposition to new plants as well as regulatory obstacles, want permission to extend operations years or even decades beyond the 40 years the reactor designers anticipated. The oldest plant, in Rowe, Mass., is now 28 years old, and most plants now operating were completed in the 1970&#39;s.</p> <p>With only a handful of reactors likely to enter service in the rest of this century, utilities are eager to extend the lives of the ones they have now.</p> <p>Plants in Florida, Virginia, Wisconsin and South Carolina have also undergone substantial replacement work. Higher Rates for Consumers</p> <p>Repairs and replacements have kept plants shut for months, limiting their electricity production and thus raising costs, meaning higher rates for consumers. Costs have risen so much that operating, maintaining and fueling the reactors now costs more than for coal-fired electric plants, which provide most of the nation&#39;s power, according to the Utility Data Institute. But the cost issue has been blunted somewhat by a rise in the price of oil.</p> <p>Worn parts have also led to concerns that old equipment could cause an accident or worsen one, and to lawsuits between utilities and suppliers.</p> <p>But industry executives say that the aging components do not represent a safety problem and that as they gain experience, they can slow the aging process or replace worn parts more easily than in the past.</p> <p>The root of the problem, many critics and some industry proponents say, is that the nuclear reactor business is still young, and went from prototype to wide use without stopping to accumulate operating experience, leaving engineers to learn about aging as they went along. Replacing Steam Generators</p> <p>At many plants, the components that have worn out are the steam generators, which were meant to last the life of the plants. The reactor may be running again by this weekend here at Indian Point 3, about 35 miles north of Times Square. Other candidates for replacements include Indian Point 2, owned by the Consolidated Edison Company.</p> <p>Degraded steam generators have spawned several lawsuits. In April, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation filed suit against the Carolina Power and Light Company, asserting that the utility failed to pay for maintenance that Westinghouse performed on the steam generators at the Shearon-Harris plant. The utility countersued, asserting that Westinghouse sold it steam generators with &#39;&#39;known defects in design, materials and workmanship.&#39;&#39; Leaks Develop Quickly</p> <p>Steam generators can develop big leaks quickly, which itself represents a significant reactor accident. In addition, some safety experts contend that if a leak elsewhere in a plant put sudden pressure on a weakened steam generator, the result could be a massive rupture that would make the accident much worse.</p> <p>Around the nation, piping in nuclear plants is also showing deterioration with age, sometimes from cracking and sometimes from a phenomenon called &#39;&#39;wasting,&#39;&#39; in which pipe walls become thinner. The General Electric Company manufactures a reactor that does not use steam generators, but is prone to cracking in some cooling pipes.</p> <p>So far the main effect of aging components has been not accidents but higher costs. Work done in operating reactors is cumbersome and expensive because of radiation levels, which rise as the plant ages. And if a plant runs less, the owners must build additional generating facilities, or burn more oil or coal in other plants, or buy power from other utilities.</p> <p>At Indian Point 3, each day of lost production means a plant elsewhere will burn about 38,000 barrels of oil, at a cost of about $800,000. The original generators rusted and leaked so much over the first 13 years of operation that they kept the plant shut for months at a time and gave it one of the worst operating records in the industry.</p> <p>The leaking has allowed small amounts of radiation to escape into clean parts of the plant, and from there into the environment, forcing shutdowns. The plant&#39;s owner, the New York Power Authority, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have said the amounts released did not pose a threat. License Extension Sought</p> <p>Despite the need for a $110 million repair job, which took seven years of planning and more than four months of work, the power authority has applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend the plant&#39;s operating license seven years beyond its scheduled expiration in 2009.</p> <p>Under the current schedule, almost half the nation&#39;s 111 nuclear plants will reach the end of their legal lives between 2005 and 2015 - if they last even that long. For example, the Rancho Seco reactor, near Sacramento, Calif., was voted shut on June 6 at the age of 15 because its owners, the customers of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, decided it would be cheaper to close the place. Not a &#39;Feasible Option&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Building a new one doesn&#39;t seem to be a feasible option today, at least around here,&#39;&#39; said Jack Brons, executive vice president of the New York Power Authority.</p> <p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, at the utilities&#39; prodding, is studying proposals to renew the 40-year licenses, but some are opposed.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They&#39;re falling apart faster than anybody expected,&#39;&#39; said Kenneth R. Boley, a researcher at Critical Mass, an antinuclear group affiliated with Ralph Nader. When a reactor requires a big overhaul, his group thinks, it should be scrapped. His group studied 15 plants that had been run for at least a year, shut for at least a year for improvements and then run for at least a year, and found that 10 performed worse after the overhaul than before. Engineers See Solution</p> <p>At Indian Point, engineers are convinced that they have isolated the source of reliability problems, and that the steam generator replacement will solve them. They have been working since the reactor was shut on Feb. 4 under an elaborate plan to remove the four steam generators, each 65 feet tall and 305 tons.</p> <p>Removing them proved a major feat. Engineers had to haul out the old generators and bring the new ones in through the equipment hatch in the thick steel and concrete containment dome, with about an inch to spare on each side. At other plants, engineers have replaced only parts of generators because the hatches are too small. Behind Barbed Wire</p> <p>The old steam generators, which will be radioactive for centuries, were carried on a special 18-axle vehicle to an open mausoleum nearby. Once they were inside, the remainder of the mausoleum wall was added, and the building was circled with an eight-foot fence, topped with barbed wire.</p> <p>In the early days of nuclear power, no one thought such elaborate tasks would be needed. &#39;&#39;There was some sense of engineering hope, that somehow these things would be different from everything human beings had built, that they weren&#39;t going to require so much maintenance,&#39;&#39; Mr. Brons said. Early projections were that with brief stops for refueling, nuclear plants could run almost 90 percent of the time.</p> <p>Indian Point 3 has run only about 50 percent of the time.</p> <p>Steam generators are not the only threat to reactor longevity; as they age, many plants&#39; reactor vessels, the thick steel pots that hold the nuclear cores, are becoming more brittle. Bombarded by neutrons, they gradually become more prone to cracking, with many losing flexibility faster than had been anticipated.</p> <p>No large plant has replaced a reactor vessel or taken other steps to repair one. No Precedent</p> <p>Many experts in the field are concerned about other parts aging. &#39;&#39;There isn&#39;t any experience with nuclear plants in their 40th year, to say nothing of their 50th,&#39;&#39; said Peter A. Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and now chairman of the New York Public Service Commission.</p> <p>But many utilities are optimistic that the plants can operate for decades longer than they are licensed for. An industry group, the Electric Power Research Institute, and the Energy Department are leading a five-year pilot project to relicense two plants: Yankee Rowe, in Rowe, Mass., which began operation in 1961 and is the nation&#39;s oldest plant, and Monticello, in the Minnesota city of the same name, which opened in 1971. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which would have to approve the relicensing, is studying the issue.</p> <p>The extension request at Indian Point is more modest. The plant has a 40-year license, beginning when the construction permit was issued by the old Atomic Energy Commission. The power authority has applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to start the 40-year clock seven years later, in April 1976, when it began operating.</p> <p>Starting the license on the day the construction permit was issued was &#39;&#39;a goof-up,&#39;&#39; said an Electric Power Research Institute official, Dr. John J. Carey. Many plants have had the date changed, he said. Decision on Repairs</p> <p>The power authority, a state agency, is not regulated by the state Public Service Commission and made the decisions on its own to seek a license extension and replace the steam generators here. But for utilities around the country, public service commissions may want a say in whether money is spent on extending reactors&#39; lives.</p>
606591>Pollution Experts Consider a Gate Across the East River Almost every summer, the oxygen levels in the waters of western Long Island Sound drop so low that fish die in huge, stinking pools. And the water quality in both the Sound and the East River is poor, despite billions spent on sewage treatment plants. Yesterday, about 100 engineers and government officials gathered at Columbia University to discuss an unusually bold approach to cleaning both bodies of water: a &quot;tidal barrage,&quot; or one-way water gate, for the East River.  <p>Currently, water sloshes between the Sound and the East River with each tide, but a barrage would be open when water flowed from the Sound to the River and shut when the tide tried to draw East River water into the Sound. The effect would be to increase the flushing action of the tides.</p> <p>The water gate could be installed in a dam-like structure, providing a new crossing on the East River, perhaps for subway or trolley cars or a new rail line to the airports, and would generate a small amount of electric power. Dozens of Questions</p> <p>Almost everyone who spoke at the daylong symposium, sponsored by the American Society of Civil Engineers, Columbia and others, was cautiously intrigued. &quot;On the surface, it appears to have broad and immediate appeal,&quot; said Edward O. Wagner, the director of New York City&#39;s Bureau of Clean Water.</p> <p>But the idea, perhaps the most audacious since engineers 30 years ago considered damming both ends of Long Island Sound to turn it into a freshwater lake, raises dozens of questions. For example, would the new barrier change the salinity of the Hudson River? Would the changed water flow increase erosion, impede the travel of fish and shellfish larvae or confuse migratory fish?</p> <p>And if the change made the water in New York Harbor clearer, would that increase the penetration of sunlight, promoting harmful algae blooms? Would it also make it easier for predator fish to catch their prey?</p> <p>The water gate would allow passage of barges and boats through locks, but would delay marine traffic.</p> <p>Several speakers repeated an estimate by Mr. Wagner, made only partly in jest, that the tidal barrage could cost $500 million, plus $1 billion for the environmental impact statement.</p> <p>Projects that would change natural systems have fallen out of favor in the last 20 years; the Westway project, a landfill on the Hudson River, was far smaller but was defeated, in part because of opposition by environmentalists.</p> <p>This project is different because its prime rationale is environmental.</p> <p>Oxygen depletion in the Sound has been getting worse even as the East River water quality improves. Some experts think that to combat the problem, New York City and municipalities in Nassau and Westchester counties will have to spend billions to reduce emissions to the Sound, particularly of nitrogen. A Certain Political Appeal</p> <p>The nitrogen, which comes from sewage treatment plants, storm water runoff and other sources, is a fertilizer for algae in the water. When the algae die, they are consumed by microorganisms that absorb oxygen. The problem is most severe in places where there is low water flow, like the western Sound.</p> <p>But a water gate, said Douglas Hill, an engineer, of Huntington, L.I., who organized the conference, would change the East River from a body of water that was never completely flushed to one that was flushed every day, cleaning up the river, New York Harbor and Long Island Sound.</p> <p>Where on the 16-mile-long East River to put the barrier was an open question. Lucius J. Riccio, the city&#39;s Transportation Commissioner, suggested the eastern end of 42d Street, where it could carry to Queens a trolley that would run across Manhattan, perhaps to the Javits Convention Center near the Hudson.</p> <p>Or, he said, the barrier could be placed downtown and carry a Second Avenue subway line into Brooklyn, or perhaps go near the Queensborough Bridge to carry a new rail line to the airport.</p> <p>Building such a barrier would probably require approval of at least two Federal agencies, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Coast Guard.</p> <p>Although Mr. Wagner had many environmental questions, he said the project would have political appeal to suburban officials who think that New York is dirtying their water. But, he said, &quot;In fact, the East River has improved while the western Sound has gotten worse. That seems to imply that there&#39;s something else going on here.&quot;</p>
178377>Price of Oil Tumbles on Output Fear Oil prices fell 55 cents a barrel, or nearly 4 percent, in futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, as dealers grew increasingly apprehensive about the rise in oil output made possible by the end of the Iran-Iraq war.  <p>In contracts for delivery next month, the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude, the United States benchmark, closed at $14.24, the lowest price since late 1986.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There&#39;s just too much oil out there,&#39;&#39; said Peter C. Beutel of Elders Futures. &#39;&#39;Demand is great, demand is wonderful, but supply is just getting out of hand.&#39;&#39; He said prices could go below $10 a barrel.</p> <p>Charles T. Maxwell, the vice chairman of Cyrus J. Lawrence, said the demand picture would not stay strong. &#39;&#39;The world economy is not on an upswing,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;If anything, it is in a slow letdown.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>North Sea Brent crude also dropped, by 50 cents a barrel. Tumbled on Little News</p> <p>The oil markets often show substantial movement in response to events of only modest significance, and yesterday the market tumbled on nearly no news at all.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Nothing is coming out of OPEC,&#39;&#39; said Sharokh Nikkah, the vice president of futures at Shearson Lehman Brothers. Subroto, the Secretary General of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, traveled to Iran and Iraq in recent days to seek a new agreement between them on oil output.</p> <p>The countries, two of OPEC&#39;s largest members, have stopped shooting at each other, but Iraq is demanding a production quota as large as Iran&#39;s and is not observing its quota.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Everybody was hopeful Mr. Subroto would make some progress,&#39;&#39; Mr. Nikkah said. &#39;&#39;But nothing is being done regarding the Iran-Iraq parity issue, and the problem of overproduction by other members can&#39;t be addressed before this is addressed.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>OPEC&#39;s production ceiling is 15.06 million barrels a day, not counting Iraq, but analysts&#39; estimates of production now run as high as 20 million. In addition, both countries need more revenue to rebuild after the war, and bigger sales are a way to raise income. What&#39;s Boosting Production</p> <p>Other members are also seeking more income. Collectively, OPEC countries spent $9.6 billion more last year than they took in from exports, according to a recent report by the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington-based consulting firm. The group&#39;s collective deficit will approach $18 billion this year, the company estimates. All these factors promote higher production volumes.</p> <p>Analysts also point to especially high stocks of oil on hand, which tend to depress prices.</p> <p>In addition, some long-term trends do not bode well for oil prices, some analysts said.</p> <p>Mr. Maxwell of Cyrus J. Lawrence also said that there are cheaper sources of energy, like coal, and, in some countries, nuclear power. &#39;&#39;Every time a new French nuclear plant comes on, it displaces fuel oil,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Gas, coal and nuclear are terribly competitive and tend to take market share from oil.&#39;&#39; Special Meeting Possible</p> <p>Mr. Maxwell said that if the current trend of overproduction leads to a price collapse, OPEC will probably call a special meeting and institute a more effective production quota system. More likely, he said, and more desirable from the point of view of consumers, was that prices would not drop drastically, and the status quo would prevail for months.</p> <p>Mr. Maxwell and others also point out that non-OPEC production worldwide is increasing, although this is not the case in the United States.</p> <p>FUTURES/OPTIONS</p>
209952>3 Reactors in Northeast Among 10 Worst-Managed The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has put three reactors in the Northeast on its list of the 10 worst-managed in the country.  <p>Most of the plants on the list had mechanical mishaps or equipment failures, but these were all viewed as symptoms of management problems. Commission staff members told the commission Wednesday that utility managers had failed to identify and solve problems, that worker attitudes were poor, or that money and personnel were not adequate to maintain the plants. The staff said corporate directors at some utilities needed to take a greater interest in nuclear operations.</p> <p>Nine Mile Point&#39;s Unit 2, in Scriba, N.Y., was added to the list, as were Calvert Cliffs 1 and 2, in Lusby, Md. Nine Mile Point 1 was already on the list, as were Turkey Point 3 and 4 in Turkey Point, Fla., Fermi 2 in Newport, Mich., Fort Calhoun in Fort Calhoun, Neb., and Sequoyah 2 in Daisy, Tenn. Also new on the list was Sequoyah 1, but this was a forward step: the plant had been closed for safety reasons. #6 Barred From Operation Six other reactors are forbidden to operate because of problems, some mechanical but mostly concerning management.</p> <p>Promoted off the commission&#39;s &#39;&#39;watch list,&#39;&#39; which had named only nine reactors, were Commonwealth Edison&#39;s Dresden 2 and 3 reactors, in Morris, Ill., and Rancho Seco, owned by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, in California.</p> <p>Plants on the list have more inspections by the commission until the reactor operators have a period of improved performance.</p> <p>The staff said nuclear operations at the 109 licensed plants around the country are generally getting safer. The staff said automatic shutdowns of reactors for safety reasons were down, automatic safety systems were forced into action less frequently. Also down was the number of mechanical or personnel failures severe enough to require a report to the commission. #17 Automatic Shutdowns Among the problem plants, Nine Mile Point 2, operated by the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation and owned by that company and four others, closed Oct. 1 for maintenance and inspections and is supposed to open next month. But it suffered 17 automatic safety shutdowns since 1987, a number that the commission staff said indicated deeper problems. Nine Mile Point 1, solely owned by Niagara Mohawk, has been closed for more than a year because of mechanical and management problems.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The focus on Unit 1 may be having an impact on Unit 2,&#39;&#39; William Russell, the staff official in charge of the Northeast region, told the commission at a briefing Wednesday. But he praised the utility for its recent hiring of several experienced managers.</p> <p>A spokesman for Niagara Mohawk, Stephen F. Brady, said in a telephone interview, &#39;&#39;We&#39;re disappointed, of course.&#39;&#39; The company&#39;s board recently established a nuclear oversight committee, he said, and the utility is taking other steps to improve operations.</p> <p>The Calvert Cliffs reactors, also new to the list, has suffered several procedural and operational errors, and one, in September, led to a worker&#39;s death. A worker passed out in a water storage tank that had been topped with nitrogen gas as a safety measure. A second man who went to his aid fell into the tank and drowned. Instrument Adjusted</p> <p>In July, when a reactor at Calvert Cliffs was being started, control room operators noticed different readings from instruments that measure power in the reactor, and adjusted the one that indicated a higher power level to match the others, without understanding why there was a discrepancy, Mr. Russell said. The instrument with the higher reading was correct, he added.</p> <p>Edward A. Crooke, president of Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, the plant&#39;s owner, said in a statement that the company would &#39;&#39;promptly return Calvert Cliffs to a position of excellence in the commercial nuclear industry,&#39;&#39; adding, &#39;&#39;We will be satisfied with nothing less.&#39;&#39;</p>
750379>Safety Audit of USAir Recommends 30 Changes An independent study commissioned by USAir said today that the airline was operated safely, but it made 30 recommendations for changes in flight, training and maintenance procedures, some echoing findings made by Federal investigators over several years. The airline ordered the study to reassure the flying public after the crash of USAir Flight 427 in Pittsburgh last Sept. 8, the fifth fatal crash for the airline in five years. That crash killed all 132 people aboard the Boeing 737-300 flying from Chicago to Pittsburgh. The cause has yet to be determined.  <p>The recommendations covered the procedures for assuring that adequate fuel is on board, the training of pilots to deal with wind shear, and the pairing of inexperienced pilots or co-pilots with older hands, all of which have figured in previous accidents or incidents.</p> <p>USAir said it had accepted 28 of the 30 recommendations and had &quot;other solutions&quot; for the remaining 2. It also insisted that it had always operated safely and that the audit, conducted at a cost of $1 million, supported that idea.</p> <p>The safety audit, by PRC Aviation of Tucson, Ariz., included recommendations as simple as having pilots strictly follow checklist procedures. The report also said that the airline should return to the practice of requiring ground crews to deliver written confirmation of fueling to the cockpit, to minimize the possibility of taking off without enough fuel, despite changes made by USAir late last year to address exactly that problem. The airline said today that it had resisted returning to a system of written confirmation but that it would now do so to reduce the risk to the absolute minimum.</p> <p>The outside auditors also said the airline should stop pairing captains and first officers when both have fewer than 100 hours of experience in that aircraft. Many other airlines have taken that step, and the Federal Aviation Administration has been developing a rule on the issue because of two crashes, one of them a USAir plane at La Guardia Airport in New York in September 1982, that the National Transportation Safety Board tied to the inexperience of the pilots. That crash killed two people.</p> <p>USAir said today that the auditors had made the recommendation even before they had finished their audit and that the airline had immediately adopted the change.</p> <p>How well the company copes with wind shear is likely to be a focus of the safety board when it meets in three weeks to determine the probable cause of the crash of a DC-9 near Charlotte, N.C., last July 2, said a board spokesman, Alan Pollack.</p> <p>Another recommendation was that the pilots not run through checklists while they taxi to the runways.</p> <p>USAir, the nation&#39;s sixth largest airline, released a summary of the audit this morning as part of an effort to reassure the public about its safety. The airline was and is safe, said Seth E. Schofield, the chairman of the board and chief operating officer, but it commissioned the audit because of &quot;recognition on our part that there were public suggestions that USAir was somehow an unsafe airline, that possibly we had cut corners, that maybe safety, because of financial conditions, was not paramount in the company.&quot;</p> <p>USAir lost $110 million in the fourth quarter of last year and $40 million in the third quarter. Mr. Schofield said that traffic was up substantially this year and that cost was never a consideration in safety. &quot;We knew that that was hogwash, but certainly we recognized that we had to prove that to the rest of the world,&quot; he told reporters today.</p> <p>Mr. Pollack, of the safety board, said his agency had not seen a copy of the audit. A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, R. Fraser Jones, said officials there had seen a summary of the audit but were waiting for a copy of the full report before analyzing it. Mr. Jones said, &quot;USAir operates with the highest level of safety in accordance with the F.A.A. regulations.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;They&#39;re safe to fly,&quot; he said, adding that the company was still subject to increased surveillance by the F.A.A.</p> <p>Among other things, the outside auditors found that USAir needed a better system for collecting and processing data on minor incidents and operating problems, to spot trends. USAir said that at the beginning of this month it had begun a new system for gathering information from pilots and other personnel, and computerizing it so it could track trends. The effort is part of a safety program developed by British Airways, a part-owner of USAir.</p> <p>While the audit does not point to any corner-cutting, it does dwell on some problems that have been recognized before at the airline. Robert C. Oaks, a retired general who is the former commander of the United States Air Force in Europe and who was hired by USAir late last year as safety chief, was asked for the most significant negative finding of the audit. Mr. Oaks said it was something that USAir had been working on for years: merging &quot;the diversity of experience and diversity of culture&quot; of the airlines that came together in the late 1980&#39;s to form USAir -- Allegheny Airlines, Pacific Southwest and Piedmont.</p> <p>In the terse summary of recommendations released by the airline, one was, in its entirety, &quot;aircraft checklists should be utilized as printed.&quot; Another was to remove the word &quot;normally&quot; from sections of pilots&#39; handbooks describing operations, to remove any suggestion that a pilot could deviate.</p> <p>In its summary responses, the airline said its goal was to institutionalize an attitude of precise adherence to procedures, &quot;as an established culture.&quot; Everything from when and how to call out changes in altitude to how to run through a checklist differ from airline to airline, Mr. Oaks said. If the procedures are standard, he said, &quot;there&#39;s not a great deal of unlearning he or she has to do&quot; when working with a new cockpit partner or moving to a different plane.</p> <p>But Mr. Oaks gave an example that seemed to minimize the size of variations. If the co-pilot calls out &quot;gear,&quot; meaning, is the landing gear down, he said, the pilot might respond, &quot;3-check&quot; or &quot;3 in green,&quot; or &quot;looks good to me,&quot; but the required response is &quot;down, three green,&quot; referring to 3 indicator lights.</p> <p>&quot;All those other things that pilots use are wrong,&quot; Mr. Oaks said. &quot;That&#39;s a deviation.&quot;</p> <p>Rick Weintraub, a spokesman for the airline, said that standardizing procedures was more a continuing process than evidence of a problem.</p> <p>Among the other recommendations were that the experts who write operating rules, called flight standards, should be part of an organization that is separate from the training organization, in essence separating the people who make the rules from those who train people to follow them. USAir said that British Airways followed this system and that it would, too.</p> <p>Several recommendations dealt with maintenance: some checks on aircraft should be done overnight, when there is more time; cockpit crews should have more contact with mechanics on the ground;, more mechanics should be trained in all the kinds of aircraft that are scheduled to operate out of their locations, and mechanics should indicate in writing that they have read new information and directives.</p>
1623371>A Smarter License: What Can It Tell? THE driver&#39;s license, that ubiquitous piece of plastic that people show millions of times a day for everything from buying a bottle of liquor to getting on an airplane -- and even, occasionally, for proving to a police officer that the bearer is allowed behind the steering wheel -- is going high tech. Apply for a license in Oklahoma, and a computer will scan your digitized photo, convert it to a series of numbers, and then compare the results with every other photo already on file in the state motor vehicle department&#39;s database, to make sure you do not already have a license under some other name.  <p>Many states now repeat all of the printed information digitally, using a bar code or a magnetic stripe or both. In Michigan, the digital information even includes what is known as a &#39;&#39;digital watermark,&#39;&#39; so any tampering will be detectable.</p> <p>The trend is still in its early stages. Virginia held a hearing earlier this month on putting computer chips into its licenses, which could store fingerprints or eye prints. Civil libertarians fear the next step is a radio-frequency identification card, akin to an E-ZPass or smart card used to pay subway fares. This would let anyone with the right equipment read a license while it was still in its owner&#39;s wallet.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There are technology solutions coming out of the woodwork,&#39;&#39; said Anne S. Ferro, who was Maryland&#39;s administrator for drivers&#39; licenses from 1997 until last year. Most are hand-me-downs that have already been employed for identity cards issued by the military and by intelligence agencies.</p> <p>But progress is far from even. Until July 1, Vermont was the last state to routinely issue licenses with no photo at all. About 100,000 of the state&#39;s half million drivers have chosen to keep their &#39;&#39;no photo&#39;&#39; licenses, and they are free to renew them indefinitely, said Bonnie L. Rutledge, the commissioner of motor vehicles.</p> <p>Until recently, New Jersey&#39;s licenses could be reproduced by anybody with a good computer printer and a laminating machine. They were long a favorite of young people who wanted licenses they could doctor to establish that they were of legal drinking age.</p> <p>Now New Jersey has begun a four-year phase-in period for new licenses with various refinements. One is that the name and date of birth are printed not only conventionally on the paper inside the lamination, but also in ink that shows up only under ultraviolet light.</p> <p>The move to make drivers&#39; licenses more sophisticated was driven in the 1990&#39;s by emerging crimes like identity theft, but gained momentum after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p> <p>The 9/11 commission, which in its final report called identification cards &#39;&#39;the last opportunity to ensure that people are who they say they are and to check whether they are terrorists,&#39;&#39; said the federal government should set standards for issuing birth certificates and drivers&#39; licenses.</p> <p>Even before the commission report, many state officials were saying the same thing, that they should tighten their procedures. In January 2003, the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators published a report recommending that states using an applicant&#39;s Social Security number no longer simply copy the number from a card or other document. Instead, they should check the number with the Social Security Administration.</p> <p>Some experts say that even without the threat of terrorism, there is plenty of reason to improve the system of issuing licenses. &#39;&#39;Not only does it have homeland security implications, it has serious highway safety implications,&#39;&#39; said Jason King, a spokesman for the motor vehicle administrators&#39; group. Of the 43,000 people killed on American roads in an average year, about a fifth, or 8,600, die in crashes involving a driver who is &#39;&#39;improperly licensed,&#39;&#39; he said. That often means the license was revoked in one state, and the driver fraudulently obtained a new license in another state, Mr. King said, because there is no national database that states can use to determine if an applicant has a license elsewhere.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The American public should be outraged to know D.M.V.&#39;s nationwide lack the capability to do the jobs we&#39;ve asked them to do,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>In recent years the federal government has tried to track everyone with a driver&#39;s license for an entirely different reason: unpaid child support. The goal is to find divorced parents with unpaid obligations who move from one state to another.</p> <p>A different problem exists for the people who look at drivers&#39; licenses, from police officers to airport security personnel: determining whether licenses are valid. There are about 240 different licenses in use in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and various territories, including provisional licenses for young people and in places like New Jersey and Vermont, newly introduced licenses and older licenses that are still valid.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s really very difficult, without the ability to read something like a watermark, to determine if it&#39;s a real driver&#39;s license,&#39;&#39; said Reed Stager, a vice president of the Digimarc Corporation, which supplies drivers&#39; licenses to many states, 10 of which use watermarks.</p> <p>Civil libertarians argue, though, that as drivers&#39; licenses become standardized, the country is moving toward a national identification card. And by checking the cards at numerous locations, the government could easily keep track of citizens&#39; movements.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Once you get a national ID, you know there&#39;s going to be an expansion beyond just government use,&#39;&#39; said Marv Johnson, the American Civil Liberties Union&#39;s legislative counsel in Washington. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s going to become the gold standard for information exchange. Private entities are going to want to see your national ID card. They&#39;re going to have their own readers to read the data.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>GETTING THERE</p>
776027>The World; Today&#39;s Drama: Twilight of the Nukes FIFTY years ago today, physicists detonated a nuclear explosive they called The Gadget, rigged on a 100-foot steel tower in the desert near Alamogordo, N.M. Since that first nuclear test, the United States has built 70,000 nuclear weapons of almost every conceivable kind: warheads, artillery shells, land mines, depth charges and even backpack-style plutonium explosives weighing 58 pounds but equivalent to 10 tons of TNT. And then there were plain old bombs, those bulbous things with tailfins, designed to be dropped out of airplanes. But now it is the twilight of the nukes. They are being taken apart by the United States and the Soviet Union at the rate of 10 or 12 a day, and the new problem is how to keep track them of all.  <p>Keeping tabs on nuclear weapons used to be easier: they were all sitting in the field and aimed at the enemy. Now there is no enemy and no clear role for the weapons, for either side.</p> <p>When the Trinity test was done, on July 16, 1945, the new physics seemed to be in perfect alignment with the United States&#39; military strategy and with its economy; it looked as if nuclear weapons could save both dollars and human lives.</p> <p>Now there is a consensus that all the weapons that the United States pointed at its adversaries over the years -- about 30,000 during the peak year, 1967 -- did not make the nation any safer than the 8,750 operable weapons the Pentagon has today. Indeed, the thinking now is that the United States might be just as safe or safer with only 5,000 weapons at the turn of the century, and maybe with even fewer later.</p> <p>The economic considerations have changed too. Nuclear weapons no longer look like the deal they once did. By one estimate last week, the United States has spent nearly $4 trillion (in 1995 dollars) in nuclear weapons since 1945, an amount equal to one-quarter to one-third of all the money spent on defense since World War II. Included in the cost is a $385 billion cleanup bill, most of it not yet spent. And whatever the theories were about nuclear bombs cutting down the casualties that would have resulted from an American invasion of the Japanese home islands during World War II and later preempting World War III, now the feeling is that a big arsenal is not going to save anyone.</p> <p>The physics exercise in progress now is proving difficult: taking back weapons from the field, taking them apart and making the nuclear fuel less weapons-ready. Then there is the question of just how far all of this should go.</p> <p>Pulling back the weapons is proceeding apace. Five years ago the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons in 15 republics, in East Germany and in other parts of Eastern Europe, according to Robert S. Norris, a weapons expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Now they have been removed from all the republics, except for Ukraine and Belarus, and from the rest of Eastern Europe. &quot;This is a logistical feat of enormous proportions,&quot; said Mr. Norris, &quot;and they should be given great credit for doing it.&quot;</p> <p>Pile-Up at Pantex</p> <p>For the United States, dismantling has proved more complex. Nuclear weapons have been taken off frigates, destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers and ships all over the world; now they remain only on ballistic missile submarines, said Mr. Norris. And the artillery shells and short-range missiles have been recalled from Europe.</p> <p>Now the weapons parts are piling up at the Pantex weapons plant, near Amarillo, Texas, which used to be the final assembly point. And so, another problem brews. What will become of the components?</p> <p>For a nuclear power, a mass of fuel sufficient for a bomb is just a few steps away from becoming a bomb again. And for nuclear wannabes -- Pakistan, Iraq or smaller figures on the world stage -- the situation is much the same. There is no longer any secret about how to build an atom bomb; the main challenge is obtaining the plutonium or uranium. Last year, radioactive material that was apparently of Russian origin turned up repeatedly in Germany, embarrassing Moscow and raising fears that stolen uranium or plutonium would be used to build new bombs.</p> <p>In the hands of a physicist, neither plutonium nor uranium is immortal. The enriched uranium can be diluted, to a level suitable for nuclear reactors but not bombs; that is what the United States plans to do with the uranium that it is purchasing from the Russians. But the Energy Department has not decided yet what to do with its own surplus uranium, now piling up at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, or with the plutonium building up at Pantex.</p> <p>Plutonium is the harder problem. There are three leading options, none risk-free or cheap: The first is to bury the plutonium at the bottom of a deep well. Another is to mix the plutonium with molten glass, and possibly with highly radioactive waste as well, so that re-using the material would require complicated chemical reprocessing. A third option is putting the plutonium in power reactors, and fissioning it to make electricity. For now, though, the plutonium sits in bunkers at Pantex. At the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, in Takoma Park, Md., the president, Arjun Makhijani, a nuclear physicist and engineer, said, &quot;The Department of Energy is extending its definition of interim to longer and longer periods. &quot;Before, &#39;interim&#39; at Pantex was six to 10 years,&quot; he said. &quot;Now they&#39;re talking about building 50-year storage facilities.&quot;</p> <p>The issue at Pantex is not so much security as appearances. The Government could keep the plutonium secure in the bunkers, said Mr. Makhijani, but there are other problems. &quot;I don&#39;t think we can afford to just park it,&quot; he said. &quot;Parking it sends the message we could just build up to 20,000 weapons again.&quot;</p> <p>The Energy Secretary, Hazel R. O&#39;Leary, said this will not happen. &quot;We&#39;re on a course to come to some real conclusions by next summer,&quot; she said in an interview. The trouble is that this large, expensive project must be taken on during what Mrs. O&#39;Leary termed a &quot;tumultuous season of dismantlement, downsizing, decapitation of the department,&quot; In such a climate, she asks, &quot;Is the public likely to want to pay the price?&quot;</p> <p>Russian Know-How</p> <p>The Russians are now ahead of the United States in deciding what to do with their nuclear material. They are determined to use their plutonium in a new generation of nuclear reactors that would make yet more plutonium. The plan is to convert the bomb fuel, now pure metal, into plutonium oxide, and mix it with regular reactor fuel, uranium oxide, into a mixed oxide fuel known as MOx.</p> <p>Unless or until that happens, though, someone has to safeguard the nuclear materials in Russia. There, as here, in a strange reversal of goals, weaponeers are now trying to revise systems that were designed for secrecy into systems that are designed to be transparent, to track the whereabouts of radioactive materials.</p> <p>After a slow start, the two countries are learning techniques from each other and are working together to fence in some of the vulnerable materials. Last year, at the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow, for example, the Russians built a new fence around Building 116, which houses two test reactors and 75 kilos of fissile material. The fence, built with American technology, has microwave sensors and alarms and cameras. At the opening is a nuclear materials detector. At Obninsk, a laboratory that stores nuclear materials in hundreds of stainless steel disks, Americans have helped the Russians install a computerized inventory system and portal monitors, which, like airport metal detectors, sound an alarm when something suspect passes through.</p> <p>In return for their help, the Americans have come home with some ideas from the Russians. One is a &quot;passport&quot; for containers of nuclear materials. The radiation output of a container is scanned to establish its radiation profile, which, like a fingerprint, is unique to that container. Then the container is marked with a bar code that links it to its profile. If the profile changes, a computer reading the bar code knows that the contents have been tampered with.</p> <p>The Russians have also tested a piece of software called a &quot;frame grabber,&quot; which analyzes video pictures for suspicious-looking characters. With a camera trained on, say, a corridor in a warehouse of nuclear materials, the Russian software discriminates between innocent passersby and thieves.</p> <p>The Russians may also have a superior hand geometry reader, according to American experts. While American workers often use passwords or identification cards to gain entry to high-security locations, Russian workers stick a hand in a reader that confirms their identity.</p> <p>Sharing and Caring and Secrets</p> <p>For all the sharing between Russia and the United States, though, there are still plenty of crucial secrets. The United States Navy believes it has the best fuel for propulsion reactors and it does not want the Russians to see it; hence Russians have not shown the Americans their nuclear fuel. And the Atomic Energy Act, a cold war era law, forbids the United States from disclosing the exact mass and geometry of the plutonium in its weapons. In return the Russians have kept that data about their weapons to themselves.</p> <p>But when it comes to security of those secret materials, Russia and the United States have a lot in common to worry about. &quot;I think that the Russians recognize that the security of weapons-capable materials is a serious problem and they&#39;re addressing it,&quot; said Charles Curtis, the Under Secretary of Energy. &quot;It&#39;s going to take a lot of time and resources to address. In the interim,&quot; he added, &quot;we&#39;re going to have to be lucky.&quot;</p>
1516635>One Vehicle on the Road, Two Others in the Garage To some drivers stuck in traffic this holiday weekend, it may look as if every car in America is on the road in front of them. But that is no longer possible.  <p>There are now more cars in American households than drivers, according to a report released today by the Transportation Department.</p> <p>So unless the cars can drive themselves, some of them will have to be &#39;&#39;left in the driveways,&#39;&#39; said Justin McNaull, a spokesman for AAA.</p> <p>The average household now has 1.75 drivers but 1.90 &#39;&#39;personal vehicles.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>By comparison, the average household has 0.86 adult-size bicycles.</p> <p>The car population has been gaining on the driver population for some time. Cars have become as specialized as shoes, experts say, with different designs for different uses.</p> <p>Mr. McNaull said that households with two adult drivers may have a car for commuting to work, a second for hauling the family around and a third, &#39;&#39;a two-seater to let mom or dad escape from the reality of the world for a couple of hours.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>And there is the odd special-purpose vehicle like the Winnebago or the restored &#39;57 Chevy (which will be on the highway this weekend only if the weather is dry).</p> <p>When people, not just drivers, are counted, one-person households have an average of 1.01 cars; two-person households have 1.98 cars; three-person households have an average of 2.31 cars; and four-person households have an average of 2.39 cars.</p> <p>The main use of cars is not long trips, but short ones. A 2001 survey found that 91.2 percent of people used cars to get to work, 4.9 percent used public transit, 2.8 percent walk and 1.1 percent used some other means.</p> <p>According to the Transportation Department, which surveyed 26,000 households and 60,000 individuals in 2001 and 2002 and is only now releasing the results, 7.9 percent of households do not have cars, down from 8.1 percent in 1995. That is within the margin of error.</p> <p>Households without cars include &#39;&#39;a lot of people living in New York, who don&#39;t want to park on Fifth Avenue and get the tickets,&#39;&#39; said Roger Lotz, a spokesman for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The total also includes households that cannot afford a car or do not have a licensed driver.</p> <p>People with cars will be driving them a lot, according to AAA, which is predicting that 33.4 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more from home over the Labor Day weekend, up 1.8 percent from last year, with 84 percent going by car.</p> <p>The number of car travelers is up 2.2 percent, the auto club said, to 28 million. An additional 3.7 million, or 11 percent, will travel by plane, down 2.6 percent, and the rest by bus, train or other mode, up slightly from last year. The figures are based on a telephone survey of 1,300 adults.</p> <p>Fuel prices are up 20 to 30 cents a gallon, Mr. McNaull said, adding that that would not make much difference for most drivers. &#39;&#39;For that couple-of-hour drive to the beach, to the mountains, to grandma&#39;s, it&#39;s an extra $3 to $5,&#39;&#39; he said. That sum, he said, is no more than the price of &#39;&#39;a fancy cup of coffee for mom and dad when you gas up.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Others were not so sanguine. Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a letter today to the energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, that in his 26 years on the House energy committee he had never seen such a steep increase; he urged an investigation.</p> <p>Also likely to be up this weekend is the number of drunken-driving fatalities, experts said.</p> <p>Year-round, alcohol is involved in about 40 percent of fatal crashes, but on Labor Day weekend in 2001, the last year for which full statistics are available, the number was more than 50 percent, said John Moulden, president of the National Commission Against Drunk Driving. Hard-core drunken drivers are responsible for a high proportion of such fatalities, but on holiday weekends they are joined by the &#39;&#39;amateurs,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Based on recent trends, including a gradually rising number of fatal accidents involving alcohol, he said, about 488 people will die this weekend in motor vehicle accidents, and 250 to 255 of those deaths will be in accidents involving alcohol, with thousands more injured.</p> <p>He recommended that people attending parties pick a &#39;&#39;designated driver,&#39;&#39; who should be sober, and not just &#39;&#39;the least drunk.&#39;&#39; And pedestrians, who make up a large fraction of drunken-driving victims, should wear light-colored clothing and walk facing traffic, he said.</p>
265504>The East Demands Power And Finds It Hard to Supply THE electric companies of the middle Atlantic states ran so short of power last summer that on two occasions the utility consortium that coordinates their production had to cut voltage to avoid blackouts. This year, with the summer less than one-third gone and the hottest weeks ahead, the consortium has already taken that step twice.  <p>The shortage comes from the growing thirst for electricity in the area served by the consortium, the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection. At the same time, efforts to build new generating stations or promote conservation are lagging. The same is true in New York and New England, and while they have a stronger supply picture at the moment, neighboring utilities share their shortages.</p> <p>The demand for electricity is growing sharply all over the country - consumption for the year ended July 1 was 4.3 percent higher than the previous year - even while total energy use is not. But the margin between supply and demand is thinnest in the mid-Atlantic states.</p> <p>Experts say the long-term trend is more serious a problem than the few days this summer when the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland consortium, known as P.J.M., is likely to feel pinched. Joseph D. Willson, a spokesman for P.J.M., said that on the peak day in 1988, demand was 2,500 megawatts higher than it was on the peak day in 1987, and the peak day this summer may be 1,700 megawatts or more ahead of last summer.</p> <p>But the 11 companies that make up the consortium, which also serves Delaware and the District of Columbia, are building almost nothing. Only two major plants are now in the pipeline.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;What&#39;s going to happen,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Willson, &#39;&#39;is we&#39;re going to see more and more instances of emergency procedures, and probably more likelihood that we will have to exercise manual load curtailment.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Load curtailment&#39;&#39; is utility talk for turning out the lights. &#39;&#39;Manual&#39;&#39; means that the step is so unusual that it is taken by a human operator, not a computer. Leading up to that point are several steps, including asking industries to cut power use and making appeals on radio and television for residential customers to turn off appliances and raise air-conditioner thermostats.</p> <p>For many parts of the country, the construction slowdown has had little effect because ambitious construction programs of the 1970&#39;s and early 1980&#39;s left huge surpluses in generating capacity. The western third of the nation has the greatest margin, with capacity exceeding peak load -the highest demand ever recorded -by 27.3 percent last year. Slim Margins</p> <p>In the northeastern quadrant of the country, however, demand has leapfrogged construction. In the P.J.M. group, capacity last year was just 11.2 percent higher than peak load; in New York and New England the margin was 15.8 percent.</p> <p>Now the operators at P.J.M. speak by conference call to their counterparts in New York, New England, Virginia and elsewhere each week and on any day forecast to be hot enough to mean heavy air-conditioning. They discuss how high the temperature may go and which equipment is expected to be operating that day. The failure of a single large generating station can require a voltage reduction, which dims lights slightly and slows electric motors but is not supposed to be noticeable.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There has definitely been a demand surge since 1986,&#39;&#39; said Thomas E. Feiler, an analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, in Cambridge, Mass. Electric use grew slightly faster than the Gross National Product from 1950 until 1973, but slower than G.N.P. from 1973 until 1986. Now it is once again increasing faster than overall economic growth, he said.</p> <p>John R. Siegal, a vice president of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, the nuclear lobby, calculated in June that over the last two years, the increase in the number of kilowatt hours sold &#39;&#39;has averaged about double the forecasts and is running about 20 percent higher than G.N.P. growth.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The rise is startling in comparison to total energy use, which has been almost flat for a decade. Residential energy consumption has declined by about one-fourth per household since 1960. But electric consumption per household is up by 150 percent.</p> <p>Industrial consumption is also galloping ahead, driven by increasing production for export and by electrification of some processes that previously used coal or oil; new steel mills, for example, are electric. A growing service economy is also consuming more electricity.</p> <p>In the short term, the trend means utilities must pay more attention to scheduling shutdowns for maintenance and to minimizing the chance that a generating station will break down. In P.J.M. and in Virginia, voltage cuts have occurred because of &#39;&#39;unscheduled maintenance,&#39;&#39; an industry term for breakdowns. Unwilling to Build</p> <p>Mr. Siegal hopes that the longer-term answer is construction, especially of nuclear plants. But he said, &#39;&#39;The utilities do not want to build anything; they are still reading the rate-regulators&#39; signals.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Last week the Westinghouse Corporation said it would build 300-megawatt plants in Bellingham, Mass., and Sayreville, N.J., with the power sold to the utilities. For non-utility generating stations, those are unusually large, but more, smaller ones are likely to follow.</p> <p>The other &#39;&#39;source&#39;&#39; is likely to be conservation, a course urged by public service commissions. Many regulators are convinced that replacing electric lights, compressors and air-conditioners with more efficient models can make electricity available more cheaply than building a new plant.</p> <p>That would please environmentalists, because it would mean less fuel burned and less air pollution, but it would also please the utilities. As Mr. Feiler noted, the electric companies, burned by cost overruns and hostile regulators, would not mind postponing construction further.</p> <p>THE NATION</p>
686008>Gasifying Garbage To Produce Electricity Trash incinerators are unpopular with their neighbors, but the main alternatives also have drawbacks: landfills can pollute groundwater, and they are filling up rapidly, and recycling is cumbersome and often expensive. So what is a sanitation department to do? New York City, among other options, is looking at a technology that a small Italian concern is promoting in Europe and the United States. The process involves shredding garbage, heating it and pressing it into ice-cube-sized bricks, and then steaming the bricks until they emit a gas that can be burned to make electricity. Along with electricity, the process produces an ash with 15 to 20 percent of the volume of the original garbage.  <p>Ash from trash, of course, involves its own set of environmental burdens, and the Supreme Court ruled earlier this week that it was covered by the same hazardous waste rules governing disposal of other industrial materials. But in the future, it may be far easier to find a place to store 15 pounds of ash than 100 pounds of trash, and the exhaust from the Italian method may be cleaner than that from conventional incinerators. Neighbors Oppose Incinerators</p> <p>New York City, which has filled every landfill but one, is trying to build an incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, over the determined opposition of people who live nearby. It is also considering several proposals for gasifiers, according to Paul J. Bekowies, a research scientist at the city&#39;s Department of Sanitation who worked in the 1970&#39;s on a United States Department of Energy project on gasification.</p> <p>One proposal before Mr. Bekowies is from an Italian engineer in New York, Roberto Rovere, representing Grillenzoni &amp; Associates of Modena, Italy, which provided designs and engineering for two gasifiers built in recent years in Italy.</p> <p>Gasification involves heating a substance in the presence of steam and a controlled amount of oxygen to produce fuel gas. Before the completion of natural gas pipelines after World War II, utilities gasified coal to supply a flammable gas to homes and street lamps. And today some companies gasify heavy oil; others are trying to gasify tougher substances, like tires that have been cooked in an oil stew to prepare for gasification. Tree Gasification Proposed</p> <p>Some environmentalists have proposed large-scale gasification of trees or crop wastes for electric power. That would not contribute to global warming, because cutting down a tree or a plant makes room for a new one to grow, absorbing as much carbon dioxide as the first one had. But very few engineers have tried using garbage as a gas feedstock.</p> <p>In general, gasification is cleaner than burning, because sulfur, acids, and other pollutants can be cleaned out of the gas before it is ignited by &quot;scrubbing&quot; -- exposing it to water and highly alkaline chemicals.</p> <p>In addition, gas can often be burned at higher efficiency than liquids or solids can, because it can be burned in turbines, high-temperature machines that resemble jet engines tethered to the ground. So a ton of, say, oil, can produce more electricity if gasified for use in a gas-turbine generator than if burned to make steam for powering a conventional generator. Even if the gas is not of high-enough quality to burn in a turbine, gasification can be more efficient than plain burning, proponents say, because it can still capture more calories of heat from the fuel. A Chemical Process</p> <p>In the gasifier, some of the fuel is burned to produce the heat needed to create steam and to roast the gas out of garbage. But the hydrogen and oxygen of the steam -- H2 O -- react with carbon and other elements in the material being gasified to produce a flammable gas. The gas can include methane (CH4 ), which is the main element in natural gas, as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen gas (H2 ), both of which burn readily. Two-Stage Plant Designed</p> <p>The Italian design is for a two-stage plant, one that makes brick-shaped blocks of ground-up trash, after removing large metal objects and all ferrous -- or iron-bearing -- materials. The bricks are processed at 285 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature high enough to prevent fermentation, reducing the garbage&#39;s odor.</p> <p>The bricks are then loaded into a gasifier, a tall metal vessel. At the bottom, some of the bricks burn, providing the heat for the gasification. But most of the content is turned into gas as the garbage bricks interact with steam piped into the gasifier. Bricks are introduced at the top and slowly work their way down, with most of the material gasified and some ending up as ash. A controlled amount of air is blown in from the bottom -- enough to facilitate the process without burning the gas. Avoiding Dioxin</p> <p>In a conventional incinerator the chlorine from PVC plastics and other sources can form dioxin, a much-feared poison. But in the gasifier, Mr. Rovere said, the chlorine reacts with the hydrogen from the steam to form hydrochloric acid, which is eventually washed out of the gas.</p> <p>Italians &quot;know something about dioxin,&quot; Mr. Rovere said, referring to an industrial accident in Seveso in 1976 that spread large amounts of dioxin, causing some residents to become seriously ill and requiring many acres to be fenced off.</p> <p>Conventional gasifiers that run on coal or oil produce a corrosive tar residue, Dr. Bekowies of the New York Sanitation Department noted. But that residue results from the big hydrocarbon molecules in coal and oil, Mr. Rovere said, and they are not present in trash.</p> <p>Mr. Rovere said that a gasifier could operate profitably on a far smaller scale than an incinerator, because of lower capital costs. His analysis of a gasifier that would handle 42,000 tons a year -- or about what New York City buries at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island every three days -- predicts that the machine would pay for itself in less than a year and a half.  City Running Out of Sites</p> <p>That assessment may be a trifle optimistic, assuming a price for the electricity produced of 8 cents a kilowatt-hour, which is below retail in New York but still well above the wholesale rate in the recent depressed market. But for New York City the biggest issue is the cost of alternative disposal. Fresh Kills will be out of space in a decade or two, depending on various trends, and the city does not have enough alternatives lined up; it is now tentatively looking for commercial landfills outside the city, but does not know what they would cost.</p> <p>Another way to look at the project is in efficiency terms. The pressed bricks have an energy value of about 5,000 British thermal units per pound, which is only one-third to one-half the energy value of a pound of coal. On the other hand, coal has to be dug out and shipped to a power plant; garbage can arrive at the plant free, since it has to be collected anyway.</p> <p>Mannesmann Italiana S.p.A., a diversified industrial company, operates a gasifier in Vicenza, using bricks of pressed, shredded garbage, and burns the gas in a nearby steel plant.</p> <p>Air emissions are &quot;well below the limits fixed by the European Community,&quot; Fulco Semiani, managing director of the ecology department of the company, wrote in a faxed response to a reporter&#39;s question.  Political Opposition Cited</p> <p>Industrie Laterizi Vogheresi, a maker of terra cotta tile, opened a similar machine in 1990, in Pavia, Italy, with financial help from the European Community, Carlo Alberto Bosi, managing director, said. The gas was used in the plant&#39;s kiln, he said in a telephone interview, but because of local environmentalists&#39; opposition the gasifier was closed. He insisted that the opposition was &quot;political, not on a real scientific base.&quot;</p> <p>He would like to reopen it, he said, as a hedge against higher prices of oil and gas. &quot;It is safe and can operate properly,&quot; Mr. Bosi said.</p> <p>Dr. Bekowies said, &quot;We are up to our elbows in analyses of gasifiers.&quot; In New York, where &quot;not in my backyard&quot; sentiment runs strong, he said, a gasifier would have to be proved safe &quot;at least to the level of rigor you&#39;d have to prove an incinerator.&quot;</p> <p>Given that neighbors are still fighting the Brooklyn incinerator plan tooth and nail, that might be a substantial burden of proof.</p> <p>BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
731894>T.V.A. Plans to Stop Work On 3 Partly Built Reactors The Tennessee Valley Authority said yesterday that it would not finish three partly built nuclear reactors and that it might close a completed plant. The T.V.A., an independent Federal corporate agency, once had the most ambitious nuclear program in the country, and had ordered 17 reactors. Now it has only one plant under construction, the last one being built in the United States. Of the five plants the agency built, only three are operable.  <p>&quot;It&#39;s the end of the line for this generation of nuclear plants,&quot; Craven Crowell, chairman of the T.V.A., said in a telephone interview. The agency had persisted in working on the plants for so long because it had been &quot;seduced a bit by the ability to easily borrow money,&quot; he added.</p> <p>The agency, one of the largest power producers in the United States, invested $6.3 billion in the mothballed reactors.</p> <p>The T.V.A. stopped most work at the three reactors, Bellefonte 1 and 2 in Scottsboro, Ala., and Watts Bar 2 in Spring City, Tenn., in 1988. But it has kept skeleton staffs at the sites at a cost of about $22 million a year, in case construction resumed.</p> <p>The plants will stay in mothballs for another year while the agency decides whether to scrap them or convert them to another type of fuel. It might find a partner to help finish them as nuclear reactors, but officials described that possibility as slim.</p> <p>The T.V.A. will now consider whether to close another plant, Browns Ferry 1, which ran from 1974 to 1985, when it was shut down along with Browns Ferry 2 and 3 because of safety problems. Browns Ferry 2 reopened in 1991 and officials say it is running well; officials hope to reopen Browns Ferry 3 in 1996.</p> <p>In his announcement yesterday, Mr. Crowell said, &quot;We are still building nuclear plants and piling up debt guided by policies that are decades out of date.&quot;</p> <p>The agency&#39;s decision was noteworthy mostly for coming so late; in the mid-1980&#39;s, investor-owned utilities and government power agencies abandoned about 100 nuclear reactors in various stages of construction after spending about $30 billion on their construction. Most acted in response to pressure from shareholders or state regulators, but the T.V.A., as a Federal agency, is answerable to neither.</p> <p>The agency&#39;s Watts Bar 1, where engineers plan to load fuel next year, is the only nuclear reactor still being built in the United States. The T.V.A. had said it was complete in 1985 and applied for an operating license then, but had to withdraw the application after workers and others raised safety questions. Since then the agency has ripped out and rebuilt parts of the plant, but it still faces opposition on safety issues.</p> <p>All four Watts Bar and Bellefonte reactors were ordered in 1970 and were supposed to be running by the mid-1970&#39;s. Construction dragged on for years as costs grew. Nearly all work on the two Bellefonte plants and Watts Bar 2 stopped in 1988, but the T.V.A. had recently resumed some engineering work on Bellefonte.</p> <p>Mr. Crowell said finishing the three plants would have cost $8.8 billion. Experts say that even starting from scratch, coal or natural gas plants of equal capacity could be built for far less.</p> <p>There are 109 licensed nuclear plants around the country, including the two Browns Ferry plants that have been closed for nine years. They produce about 20 percent of the nation&#39;s electricity.</p> <p>Some produce power at less than the cost of alternate sources but several make electricity that is more expensive than power from natural gas or coal, and they may be retired soon. In addition, the Energy Department says several plants may have to shut down in the next few years unless a place is found to put their spent fuel.</p> <p>The T.V.A. said yesterday that to meet demands for power it would consider buying it from independent producers, building new non-nuclear plants or helping its customers invest in more efficient equipment, to reduce the demand for power.</p>
506207>Cars That Whirrr And Burn Rubber Say &quot;electric&quot; and the car that comes to mind is smooth-riding, quiet and almost antiseptically clean. It&#39;s not exactly the model muscle car. But muscle is how the General Motors Corporation is positioning the Impact, the two-seater that it plans to bring to market in the mid-90&#39;s. To meet California requirements that 2 percent of each car company&#39;s sales in the state be &quot;zero emission vehicles&quot; by 1998 -- a requirement that only battery-powered cars can now meet -- G.M. has focused on a sales virtue that it thinks will give it perhaps the best chance of reaching such a high penetration: performance.  <p>&quot;They&#39;ve made a decision that you have to show people something that makes them want to buy an electric car,&quot; said one California official, who asked that he not be identified because, he said, it sounded as if he were shilling for General Motors.</p> <p>Some people like the idea. Mark Scheinberg, executive director of the Greater New York Auto Dealers Association, said that the male ego wants a &quot;throaty, sporty kind of sound,&quot; and the electric car&#39;s silence could be a drawback. &quot;They&#39;re answering that by putting a little guts behind it,&quot; Mr. Scheinberg said. &quot;It&#39;s a very clever idea; it should work very well.&quot;</p> <p>But at the Center for Auto Safety, Clarence M. Ditlow, the executive director, said, &quot;If you want to sell the car, you&#39;re betteroff going to the mass market, which is nota muscle market.&quot; Besides, he said,electric cars should be pitched to &quot;the environmental market, the socially conscious consumer, who is very turned off by muscle cars.&quot;</p> <p>The Impact goes from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 8 seconds. Among 1991 models, according to Road &amp; Track magazine, that is faster than the Lexus LS 400 and the Chevrolet Beretta GT and substantially faster than the Pontiac Grand Prix SE; it is just a shade behind the BMW 325iX.</p> <p>As one G.M. engineer put it recently as he watched the Impact whir and whoosh around a test track at G.M.&#39;s proving ground here, &quot;This is not your father&#39;s Oldsmobile.&quot;</p> <p>People outside the company are impressed with the performance too. &quot;It will snap your head back,&quot; said William Sessa, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, who rode in the car at the Los Angeles Auto Show in early January. And performance is not limited to jackrabbit starts; because electric motors deliver torque very quickly, the Impact&#39;s mid-range acceleration -- from, say, 25 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour -- is substantially better than in most gasoline-powered cars.</p> <p>Its styling is also dramatic. &quot;It gives the stylists a lot of freedom,&quot; said Larry Oswald, of G.M.&#39;s Advanced Engineering staff. &quot;It opens up all kinds of possibilities. You don&#39;t need a big engine compartment, and if you want, you can break up the batteries.&quot;</p> <p>While other car makers are working on electric vehicles, none have been as open as G.M. about showing them off. (Even G.M., however, will not discuss a specific date, price, or even the name, except to say that &quot;Impact&quot; is interim and not a contender for the final nameplate.)</p> <p>In what G.M. described as an effort to educate the public about electrics, it recently trotted out the Impact on a look-but-don&#39;t-touch basis and made two Geo Storms and a Chevy Lumina with Impact drivetrains available for test drives.</p> <p>The company is probably right that public acceptance of electrics will require some familiarity. Apart from large problems, like recharging, there are a thousand small ones, like the one pointed out by advocates for the blind: Will guide dogs have to be retrained to be alert to a car that is silent?</p> <p>And General Motors has its own set of problems to solve before it can release the car. Because the car lacks the background noise of an engine, every whistle and squeak can be heard, sending engineers in search of new ways to damp sound. The $100,000 cost of the power electronics in the models on the test track must come down by a factor of 50.</p> <p>What is more, while the batteries will move the car more than 100 miles, the car will not go nearly that far if it must also keep passengers warm or cool. California, whose regulations serve as the model for at least 11 states, has yet to allow for, say, a small propane space heater. Without a heater, &quot;We don&#39;t know how to build a car for Maine,&quot; said Jean L. Crocker, a G.M. spokeswoman.</p> <p>Although the Impact&#39;s batteries weigh nearly 900 pounds, the electric car has energy equivalent to only about 1.5 gallons of gas. Thanks to stingy engineering, that will take the car more than 100 miles -- impressive but only about a third as far as an average car will go on a tankful of gasoline. The range may eventually be substantially greater, but for now, proponents hope that recharging stations will be readily available and that consumers will accept the car as useful for everyday drives.</p> <p>So how can a car with such energy limitations be so lively?</p> <p>It is an unexpected result of a combination of technological limitations and marketing considerations, which drove G.M. to a series of choices.</p> <p>Among them, the auto company chose to use the familiar lead-acid battery rather than one based on newer technology. Amid disadvantages like a prodigious size and weight, G.M. found a compelling marketing benefit in the lead-acid battery: its ability to deliver power fast.</p> <p>On the down side, lead-acid batteries offer limited storage. The Impact&#39;s lead acid holds about 35 watt-hours per kilogram, compared with 100 watts per kilogram for sodium sulfur batteries, which Mercedes is working with, and 165 watts per kilogram for lithium iron disulfide, another newer technology.</p> <p>Yet lead-acid batteries deliver power faster, much as a bigger garden hose will drain a tank of fixed capacity faster than a smaller hose. In the case of lead-acid, the hose is large; it can deliver 280 watts per kilogram of battery weight, versus 110 for sodium sulfur and 200 for lithium iron disulfide, according to G.M. engineers.</p> <p>And just as lead acid batteries deliver power faster, they also accept it faster. The Impact has &quot;regenerative braking,&quot; or the ability when a driver lifts his foot off the accelerator to turn the motors that power each front wheel into generators instead. Rather than converting electricity into mechanical force, they turn mechanical force -- the inertia of the car -- into electricity, which is dumped back into the battery.</p> <p>In city driving, regenerative braking captures two-thirds of the energy lost at each stop sign or red light, energy that in a conventional car is converted to heat by the brakes, and then dissipated.</p> <p>To make up for the heaviness and low storage capacity of lead-acid batteries, the company chose an induction motor, which at high speed turns electricity into mechanical force with an efficiency of about 95 percent. Unlike other motors, it is also very efficient at low speed. It can also run at up to 15,000 revolutions per minute, which eliminates the need for a transmission.</p> <p>At 57 horsepower each, the two motors together have about the same power as the four-cylinder gasoline engine commonly used in a small to mid-sized car; but they give this light-body two-seater a lot of zip.</p> <p>The combination of the lead-acid battery and the induction motor, however, added complications. While the batteries supply power to the motor quickly, it is direct current; the motors run on alternating current. That pushed G.M. engineers to come up with new advances in a field of electronics called power conditioning, converting electricity from one form to the other.</p> <p>Power conditioning essentially means using silicon switches, akin to computer chips, to synthesize a precise alternating current. Before G.M., this technology was used in windmills, where the blades could turn at whatever speed the wind pushed them but the generator would turn out perfect 60-cycle, alternating-current power for the utility grid.</p> <p>To make the conversion, G.M. chopped the direct current into pulses. By alternating short, medium and longer pulses of direct current, the switches create a power flow that looks like a sine wave, rising and falling in the pattern that the electric motor needs.</p> <p>The power electronics also controls acceleration, and does it smoothly. To go faster, the motors need more torque, or mechanical power, and more speed. The torque increases with the amplitude of the sine wave -- that is, with its &quot;height&quot; if it were charted on a graph -- and the motor speed rises with the frequency, which, unlike a utility electric system, is not fixed at 60 cycles. The power electronics system takes its cue from the driver&#39;s foot on the accelerator.</p> <p>During acceleration, the system handles 100,000 watts. In a residential setting, that much power could run a small neighborhood.</p> <p>Packing a car with sophisticated electronics may have some side benefits. The car would probably be charged on a circuit controlled by the electric utility, so the utility could supply the power during off-peak periods, at a reduced price.</p> <p>Once connected to the utility with a communications link, all kinds of possibilities emerge. &quot;It can run diagnostics at 3 A.M.; when the thing&#39;s plugged in, you can talk to it,&quot; said Bob Wragg, G.M.&#39;s manager of electric vehicle market development for California. The car could report back to a General Motors computer, which in turn would send the owner a letter saying that the right rear tail light was out. And because each car is identifiable, it could notify the police that a car had been stolen.</p> <p>None of this clever engineering, however, is completely voluntary. If 11 Eastern states all follow California&#39;s lead as they promised to, a third of the national car market will require that 2 percent of sales be electric cars. (Massachusetts on Friday became the first to complete adoption of the California rules.) The requirement rises to 5 percent in 2003, meaning hundreds of thousands of electric cars will be sold.</p> <p>California has not yet spelled out the penalties for missing the quota, but they could include refusing to let the car maker sell cars there the next year. But a company that sells more than its quota could find itself in a new, very profitable line of business: selling credits for its extra electric production to competitors who have fallen short. WHY NOT USE SOLAR CELLS?</p> <p>In the popular imagination, nothing seems more appropriate to power an electric car than photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight directly into electricity. General Motors has experience in the field, having built the Sunraycer, the winner of a race across the Australian desert. But the company is not considering solar cells for the Impact.</p> <p>The reason, according to Bob Wragg, the manager of electric vehicle market development for California, is energy density. The sun shines with an intensity of about 1,000 watts per square meter, and the highest quality solar cell likely to be used on a car is able to convert only 20 percent of that energy to electricity, he said. If a designer squeezed 2.5 square meters of cells into a car, that would produce 500 watts.</p> <p>But at a steady cruise of 55 miles per hour, the Impact consumes about 6,000 watts, he said, using electricity about 12 times faster than the cells can provide it.</p> <p>The solar cells would also be of limited help for battery charging. The Impact stores about 14,000 watt-hours. If the cells provide 500 watts in an hour, it would take about 28 hours of bright daylight to charge the car. (At 55 miles per hour, it would take just over two hours to consume it again.)</p> <p>But a few solar cells might be useful, he said, to &quot;top off&quot; the charge, countering the natural tendency of a battery to lose charge over time, whether the device it powers is in use or not.</p> <p>The Impact may also use solar cells to run an exhaust fan in the car when it is parked in the sun with the windows up. That would prevent excessive heat buildup in the car, and so would reduce the work that the air-conditioner must do when it is first turned on.</p>
635276>It&#39;s as Big as the Period at the End of This Sentence. ONCE upon a time, when the world was simpler, a foot was really as long as someone&#39;s foot, and a cubit the distance from someone&#39;s elbow to the end of the middle finger. Now we measure things that are much smaller than shoes and larger than arks, but there is still a desire to put them in a human context. Sometimes, comparisons to the old and familiar work -- so many football fields, so many times to the moon. But sometimes it seems as if nature is too much with us as we try to express our expanding powers of science and industry in comprehensible terms.  <p>Take the micron, for example, a unit so small -- one millionth of a meter -- that it seems hard to cast in a human context. But that doesn&#39;t stop newspapers from trying; they inevitably hitch it to something else: a human hair. Earlier this year, describing the one-micron width of a computer circuit, one newspaper article said a hair, by comparison, is 100 microns across. But another article, on cancer-causing soot particles smaller than 10 microns, said a human hair was 75 microns in diameter. Last year, in an article on fiber-optic beams, a human hair was 70 microns; in 1982, in one on coatings for cutting tools, the hair was down to 25 microns.</p> <p>Just how small is a micron?</p> <p>Very.</p> <p>And a hair?</p> <p>Evidently, it varies.</p> <p>It can be hard to grope with the big, too. Strategically Speaking, a marketing newsletter, said recently that 1.8 billion slices of frozen pizza are sold each year -- enough to cover 511,366 square miles. How big is that? The newsletter had the sense not to give the answer in microns: enough to cover New York, California, Texas, Maine, Delaware and Rhode Island combined.</p> <p>The answer should be savored for its form rather than its content. It demonstrates that one should never use an almanac and a calculator together without special training. For the calculation to be correct, each slice would have to cover nearly 8,000 square feet. (A square mile is 27,878,400 square feet; 1.8 billion divided by 511,366 square miles gives 3,520 slices to the square mile. That&#39;s 7,920 square feet per slice, give or take an anchovy.)</p> <p>The newsletter attributed the data to the National Frozen Pizza Institute, a trade association. But the institute&#39;s executive director, Francis G. Williams, said it did not keep track of sales. Besides, he said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how you&#39;d figure that out anyway.&quot;</p> <p>Still, the analysis gets points because it is the classic use of another key unit of metaphoric measurement: the Rhode Island.</p> <p>Life Magazine says Yellowstone National Park is three times the size of Rhode Island. The Associated Press describes one Iceland icecap as three Rhode Islands. The Golan Heights, says The Washington Times, is five Rhode Islands. (Although that calculation may have something in common with the frozen pizza one; the Encyclopedia Britannica gives the size of the Golan at 444 square miles -- about half a Rhode Island.)</p> <p>&quot;It keeps coming up -- it&#39;s kind of fun,&quot; said Elmer Cornwell, parliamentarian of the Rhode Island House of Representatives.</p> <p>The Rhode Island (1,045 square miles) isn&#39;t always the handiest measure. For example, the Exxon Valdez is widely reported to have spilled its oil across an area 15 times the size of Rhode Island. That might just as easily have been described as two New Jerseys, but a New Jersey just isn&#39;t an accepted yardstick.</p> <p>Nor would it do to call the Golan half a Rhode Island, or one-and-a-half New York Cities. Some fractions just aren&#39;t poetic. Who, for example, would describe an attractive face in milli-Helens -- the amount of beauty necessary to launch one ship?</p> <p>There are other standards of measurement that have been elevated to cliche status. &quot;The period at the end of this sentence,&quot; for one. A divorced Tennessee couple fought a court battle recently over custody of seven fertilized embryos, which were described far and wide as each being the size of a period. The deer ticks that carry Lyme Disease run about the same size although, like human hair, they vary in printed reports. Or maybe the print does.</p> <p>For measuring things bigger than a micron but smaller than a Rhode Island, there is the Smoot. Oliver R. Smoot Jr. was a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1958 when an upperclassman told a group of Lambda Chi Alpha pledges to measure the Massachusetts Avenue bridge over the Charles River and to use Mr. Smoot (5-foot-7) as their yardstick. Flipping him end over end, they found the bridge to be &quot;364.4 Smoots, plus one ear.&quot;</p> <p>They painted a line at each 10 Smoots, and subsequent pledges had to repaint them annually until the coats built up into a kind of speed bump. When Massachusetts rebuilt the bridge a few years ago, officials gave the fraternity a chunk of concrete with the built-up paint, and put up a plaque. So far, Mr. Smoot has not achieved the status of Mr. Celsius or Mr. Fahrenheit.</p> <p>On the other hand, nor have writers finished determining how many metaphors can dance on a head of a pin -- which is about the same size as the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
1313308>As Flight Delays Ease Off, New-Runway Push Begins New government figures show that flight delays eased markedly in the second quarter of this year, but the airlines and air traffic controllers, describing passengers as still unhappy, will open a campaign on Thursday to build public support for new runways and other improvements. The new data, from the Federal Aviation Administration, show delays down in April and June and up only slightly in May, compared with performance in the corresponding months of last year. The drop for the three months together was nearly 10 percent.  <p>Flight cancellations, lost baggage and passenger complaints were also down. Airlines say that they lose fewer bags, especially for connecting passengers, when planes are on time,  and that passengers are less prone to complain about anything if their flight lands when it is scheduled to.</p> <p>But industry experts say the public remains dissatisfied, still acutely conscious of delays. And the Air Transport Association, the trade group for the major airlines, is trying to shift attention away from calls for Congress to enact a &#39;&#39;passenger bill of rights,&#39;&#39; and toward creating a national consensus for new runway construction. The airlines see that step as crucial to improving their on-time records in the years ahead, as air traffic continues to grow.</p> <p>The airlines and the controllers&#39; union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, are drafting a letter to President Bush seeking a strong statement from him that building new runways is a national priority. John M. Meenan, vice president of the Air Transport Association, said the airlines would like Congress to create incentives for local and state governments, where authority for runway construction typically rests, to pay attention to the needs of the carriers and their passengers. One method, Mr. Meenan said, would be to threaten loss of federal highway funds for cities that will not build new runways that Washington thinks are needed.</p> <p>The controllers&#39; union and the Air Transport Association will sponsor what they call a &#39;&#39;summit meeting&#39;&#39; here on Thursday that will include an unusually broad group, including the biggest union of airline pilots and organizations representing airports, regional airlines, cargo airlines, owners of private and business airplanes, and aerospace manufacturers. The F.A.A. administrator, Jane F. Garvey, will give a speech praising the cooperation that has helped reduce delays this year, a spokesman for the agency said.</p> <p>The airlines and the controllers say such cooperation, which now includes conference calls every hour among the airlines and air traffic control headquarters, has played a role in easing delays, as have air traffic equipment that breaks down less often and some improvements in air traffic software.</p> <p>Weather has helped, too, with thunderstorms less a factor. As Ms. Garvey put it in remarks prepared for delivery on Thursday, &#39;&#39;Mother Nature is better behaved this year.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But &#39;&#39;weather is not the be-all and end-all of the story,&#39;&#39; Carol Hallett, president of the Air Transport Association, said in an interview, praising what she described as &#39;&#39;fine-tuning&#39;&#39; of a system of cooperation that began in the spring of 2000.</p> <p>Still, Ms. Hallett and the president of the controllers&#39; union, John Carr, said cooperation and new air traffic software would take them only so far. They said software improvements now being adopted or in development, some still years from being put in effect, would expand the system&#39;s capacity to handle passenger planes by no more than 11 percent.</p> <p>The industry&#39;s focus contrasts with the position taken last week by the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Aviation, Representative John L. Mica, Republican of Florida. Mr. Mica said that severe air traffic delays at La Guardia Airport in New York had been largely solved by limiting the number of flights allowed there and that the same step should be taken at other airports where schedules exceed the capacity estimated by the F.A.A.</p> <p>One goal in the industry&#39;s campaign is faster environmental review, whether state or federal, of proposed runway construction.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We were able to get a man on the moon in eight years,&#39;&#39; Ms. Hallett said. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re unable to get any runway built in eight years.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The airlines are particularly eager for additional runways at O&#39;Hare in Chicago, Logan in Boston and San Francisco International. New construction at all face strong local opposition.</p> <p>The new flight-delay data from the F.A.A. measures the timeliness of &#39;&#39;operations,&#39;&#39; which, for each flight, include not only the takeoff and the landing but also occurrences like one traffic control center&#39;s handing the flight off to another.</p> <p>The data showed that two major airports in the New York area experienced improvements in the first half of the year. Delays of 15 minutes or more were down 22 percent at Newark International Airport, despite an increase of 3.5 percent in landings and takeoffs, and down 43 percent at Kennedy International Airport, despite a 3.6 percent increase.</p> <p>At La Guardia, flight delays in the first half were up nearly 42 percent compared with the first half of 2000. But that was an improvement from last fall, when a lifting of controls on landing and takeoff schedules brought a flood of traffic and near gridlock. Those controls were reinstituted this year.</p>
603136>Clean-Air Laws Push Big 3 To Cooperate on Electric Car In an extraordinary collaboration by Detroit&#39;s auto makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler are discussing jointly building an electric car to meet the requirements of the clean-air law first enacted in California and recently adopted by several Northeastern states. Officials of the companies said yesterday that they were considering the project because of impending deadlines.  <p>The state laws require that by the 1998 model year, 2 percent of every auto company&#39;s sales be &quot;zero-emission vehicles,&quot; presumably electric cars. Because no such vehicles are currently mass-produced, Detroit is not certain how to build them, or even more important, how to sell them.</p> <p>To start now with a new vehicle and have it ready for the 1998 model year would require moving at &quot;warp speed,&quot; said Jason Vines, a Chrysler spokesman. Urged to Look Overseas</p> <p>&quot;It only makes sense for car makers to cooperate,&quot; said William Sessa, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, which created the program. A collaborative effort in Detroit &quot;would follow the example set in other automotive capitals, like Stuttgart and Tokyo,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The discussions, which Mr. Vines described as &quot;advanced,&quot; cover a range of possibilities -- from sharing components like batteries, electronic-control gear and other specialized parts, to jointly building full drivetrains or even the entire vehicles.</p> <p>That could be the Impact, a zippy two-seater that General Motors developed and until this past December had planned to mass-produce, but then postponed. Or it could be another vehicle. Can&#39;t Go All That Far</p> <p>Ford has a prototype electric cargo van called the Ecostar, based on the current Aerostar gasoline-powered models. And Chrysler builds a van it has named the TEVan -- for Total Electric Vehicle -- an electric version of its Dodge Caravan, which some utility companies have bought as demonstration vehicles.</p> <p>But all three of these have driving ranges of 100 miles or less and are expected to cost far more to produce than conventional gasoline-powered cars. Dodge&#39;s TEVan, for example, is priced at $120,000 -- compared with a range of $16,000 to $23,000 for the gasoline models.</p> <p>&quot;There is an awful lot of planning and development that has to go on,&quot; said Helen O. Petrauskas, vice president at Ford for environmental and safety engineering. &quot;With relatively low volume, and a huge investment needed in all that new technology, you can see where there would be some advantage to working together,&quot; she said in an interview yesterday.</p> <p>General Motors&#39; vice president and general manager of its research and development laboratory, Arvin F. Mueller, said discussions were continuing among the chief executives of the three companies and other high-ranking executives, as well as G.M., Ford and Chrysler engineers. The situation is &quot;very fluid,&quot; he said. To meet the 1998 deadline, firm decisions on what to build would have to be made this year, he added.</p> <p>The companies are under pressure because of a provision of the Federal Clean Air Act of 1990 that gave California the right to set its own stronger standards for automotive emissions and gave the 49 other states the right to adopt California&#39;s approach if they decided that they needed something stronger than the Federal standards. Preserving the Environment</p> <p>The California program calls for an increasing portion of electric vehicles to be sold beginning in 1998, as well as cars that will run cleaner on gasoline, natural gas or other fuel.</p> <p>New York, Massachusetts and Maine have passed laws adopting the California program. A Federal district court has thrown out New York&#39;s law, after a protest by General Motors over issues that include whether a state can embrace the California program for cars without also adopting the rules for gasoline. New York state has appealed the decision.</p> <p>New Jersey has voted to adopt the program if enough nearby states follow suit, and others in the Northeast are leaning toward doing the same.</p> <p>The three companies have not worked closely together since the early 1960&#39;s, when the first pollution-control rules were proposed, according to Mrs. Petrauskas, and all that came of that, she said, was a complaint from the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department.</p> <p>The companies maintain that they can perform joint research more easily now because of changing interpretations by the courts and a 1984 law, the National Cooperative Research Act, that provides immunity from antitrust laws for joint research ventures that are disclosed in advance to the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.  Batteries and Dummies</p> <p>Several collaborative automotive projects are under way, including on one vehicle that would operate on batteries. The companies are also working together to develop better crash dummies, and yesterday they announced a patent on a new way to cast composite materials for use in lightweight vehicle frames.</p> <p>Those three projects are under the auspices of an umbrella organization formed last year, the United States Council for Automotive Research.</p> <p>The current discussions about an electric car are also under the group&#39;s purview. Its officials said yesterday that they believed they could introduce an electric car without violating antitrust laws because there is currently no market for the vehicles, and thus no market to monopolize. But they said that if a market developed in a few years, the companies might be required to go their separate ways.</p> <p>The automotive council expects any American-produced electric car to compete with a Japanese version, the development of which is being coordinated by Japan&#39;s energetic Ministry of International Trade and Industry.</p> <p>So far, it is not certain that Detroit&#39;s auto makers companies will decide to pool their resources. Mrs. Petrauskas pointed out that traditionally, the companies like to differentiate their products from those of competitors, a factor that by definition pulls companies in different direction.</p> <p>All three American auto makers wonder how they will sell the cars. The California law, they point out, requires them to meet sales quotas for electric vehicles, but does not force anyone to buy what they produce.</p> <p>By the year 2000, 5 percent of each company&#39;s sales of cars and light trucks in California and other participating states must be electric, and in 2003 the number rises to 10 percent.</p> <p>Mr. Mueller said that the development cost of an electric vehicle is about seven times what a new gasoline-fueled car would be, but that given the electrics&#39; novelty and range limits, potential customers would probably not be willing to pay more for them -- unless air pollution becomes so bad that driving a conventional car is banned.</p> <p>BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
152726>Nuclear-Plant Vote Worries Utilities Opponents of nuclear power think they have a good chance to close the troubled Rancho Seco nuclear plant near Sacramento, Calif., in a local referendum tomorrow.  <p>If successful, the action could have significant ramifications for utilities that operate reactors like Rancho Seco, which is similar to one that experienced a partial core meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania nine years ago. It also would further undermine the nation&#39;s struggling nuclear power industry, which is troubled by high operating costs and frequent shutdowns.</p> <p>So concerned are some utilities that run similar reactors that at least one, the Duke Power Company, which operates in North and South Carolina, contributed money to defeat the referendum. The company, which donated $100,000, fears that losing the vote would set a precedent that could lead to a shutdown of other plants.</p> <p>Duke Power has even offered, for a fee, to run the Rancho Seco plant, where the management has been accused of tolerating sloppy operation.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We are all in the nuclear boat together,&#39;&#39; said Mary T. Boyd, a spokeswoman for Duke. &#39;&#39;We all must perform well.&#39;&#39; Other Antinuclear Efforts</p> <p>The referendum is also troubling to other utilities that operate different types of reactors and face efforts to shut down their plants.</p> <p>Referendums have been brought by opponents of nuclear power in several states, most recently in Maine after the Chernobyl reactor accident in the Soviet Union. That drive, like all previous ones, was defeated. Reactor opponents will try in Massachusetts in November with a measure that could close the Pilgrim reactor, in Plymouth, owned by the Boston Edison Company, and Yankee Rowe, in Rowe, owned by a consortium of utilities.</p> <p>Opponents of nuclear power won a victory last month when New York State reached an agreement with the Long Island Lighting Company to abandon the Shoreham nuclear power plant.</p> <p>The Rancho Seco plant is a prime target for closure because it is one of the least reliable reactors in the nation. Mainly because of lengthy shutdowns, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the plant&#39;s owner, has raised electric rates 83 percent in four years. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has attributed many of the problems to poor management.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They made a life&#39;s work out of doing the bare minimum,&#39;&#39; said John B. Martin, the commission&#39;s regional administrator.</p> <p>Duke Power, which already operates three reactors in Seneca, S.C., said it could improve Rancho Seco&#39;s reliability. It offered to operate the Rancho Seco plant for $25 million a year, plus $1 million for each percentage point that reactor reliability rises above 50 percent. Mayor Favors a Shutdown</p> <p>Proponents of the shutdown, who have emphasized financial arguments, have won the support of the Mayor of Sacramento and other local officials. The general manager of the utility district, known as SMUD, also favors closing the 873-megawatt plant.</p> <p>But the directors of the district have put a second measure on the ballot that would let the plant operate for at least another 18 months. They contend that the utility&#39;s customers will save money over the long term if the plant can be run consistently.</p> <p>Polls have shown voters in Sacramento and the neighboring towns in the utility district are divided over closing the plant.</p> <p>The plant employs 940 SMUD workers, as well as 700 people who work for contractors. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Plant</p> <p>Rancho Seco&#39;s main components were designed and built by Babcock &amp; Wilcox, a subsidiary of McDermott International Inc. Other Babcock &amp; Wilcox plants, which use a smaller volume of cooling water and are therefore more sensitive, have had a variety of mishaps. The most serious problem was the cooling water failure and undetected leak at the General Public Utilities Corporation&#39;s Three Mile Island facility near Harrisburg, Pa., that led to the partial melting of the nuclear core in 1979.</p> <p>Six years later, in June 1985, the system of pumps that provides cooling water failed at a plant of similar design, Davis-Besse in Oak Harbor, Ohio. The plant, owned by the Toledo Edison Company, was shut for 18 months.</p> <p>A study in November by the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that despite improvements in the Babcock &amp; Wilcox reactors after the Three Mile Island accident, &#39;&#39;the number and complexity of events in plants with reactors designed by Babcock &amp; Wilcox have not decreased as expected.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The study also found that the loss of cooling water produces a &#39;&#39;more severe&#39;&#39; response in Babcock &amp; Wilcox reactors than in those of other manufacturers because of their design.</p> <p>The study, based largely on engineering work done for the owners of the eight plants, concluded that they &#39;&#39;do not present unacceptable levels of risk, nor do they contain serious unidentified risk vulnerabilities.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Babcock &amp; Wilcox plants have been the targets of the Union of Concerned Scientists. It argued last year that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#39;s main safety studies examined only plants built by three other reactor manufacturers - the General Electric Company, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and Combustion Engineering Inc. - and that the level of safety of Babcock &amp; Wilcox plants was unknown. The commission rejected the argument.</p> <p>A great deal of money has been invested in Rancho Seco. For example, $400 million was spent during the recent 27 months that it was shut down, and it cost $200 million more to buy replacement power from other utilities until the plant reopened in April. The utility has only 400,000 customers.</p> <p>SMUD directors and other supporters of the plant contend that this investment has created a reactor that will run reliably at low cost.</p> <p>But a panel appointed by SMUD recommended in February that Rancho Seco not be reopened because reliable operation was unlikely.</p> <p>Rancho Seco has had a poor operating record, producing over its lifetime less than 40 percent of the power that would have resulted had it run at full power. The average of power plants in the United States is about 60 percent. Rusted Water Valves</p> <p>One reason is the extended shutdowns for safety. In the incident in December 1985 that led to the 27-month shutdown, the system that supplies water to be boiled into steam (and also keeps the reactor from overheating) malfunctioned, pumping too fast. Instead of using controls in the control room to slow down the water flow, operators sent workers to close valves manually.</p> <p>But the valves were rusted open because they had not been lubricated since the plant opened. Operators cut off the water supply to the pumps. That led to a spill of 1,200 gallons of slightly radioactive water inside the plant and the release of a small amount of radioactive gas into the atmosphere.</p> <p>The 1985 accident was Rancho Seco&#39;s fifth overcooling incident. The plant is also known for a mishap in 1978, set off when a worker dropped a light bulb behind an instrument panel in the control room. That caused a short circuit and a blackout in the control room, activating the emergency pumps.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;In the past at Rancho Seco,&#39;&#39; said Robert Pollard, the chief reactor expert of the Union of Concerned Scientists, &#39;&#39;one of the biggest problems was, in their short-term economic interest, they didn&#39;t do any of the routine maintenance and preventive maintenance. Basically, they operated on the theory if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it.&#39;&#39;</p>
513611>Technology; Talk About a Slogan for the Back-to-Basics 90&#39;s: Electrify! All over the United States, utilities are diving into the technology of conservation, helping consumers install new light bulbs, electric motors and heating and cooling systems designed to use less electricity. The current thinking is that the nation should do the same work with less power, to allow generating stations that burn coal to be closed. These plants emit the ingredients of acid rain and also a high level of carbon dioxide, the single largest cause of the greenhouse effect. But according to a contrarian school, this approach is backward. If pollution or the greenhouse effect is really the problem, according to the counter-theory, there is a technical fix at hand. It is to use as much electricity as possible.  <p>How can burning more coal, oil and gas in power plants help the environment? According to Mark P. Mills, a long-time energy consultant, some technologies can perform work better with electricity than with other fuels. The idea has been around for a few years, but Mr. Mills has refined it and given it a name: ecowatts.</p> <p>Ecowatts, he said, means using electricity instead of another fuel and gaining benefits for the global environment, often as a side effect of gains in convenience or economy or perhaps in alleviating local pollution. He points to lawn mowers.</p> <p>In southern California, air pollution officials have instituted strict rules on lawn mower emissions. According to Mr. Mills, to meet the rules mowers will come to resemble cars, with electronic fuel injection and catalytic converters. That, he said, means the debut of the $650 lawn mower, and prices that high will just turn the state into a magnet for all the nation&#39;s used mowers, defeating the regulation. The answer, he said, is electric mowers, a technology that is hardly new but, he said, is underappreciated.</p> <p>By Mr. Mills&#39;s calculation, the standard gasoline mower, at three horsepower, burns a quart in two hours. But the same job could be done with 2.2 kilowatt-hours of electricity. (A typical home uses about 20 kilowatt-hours a day.)</p> <p>Burning the gasoline releases 36,800 B.T.U.&#39;s of heat, by Mr. Mills&#39;s calculation, taking into account the energy that was used to refine the gasoline. The electricity created 24,400 B.T.U.&#39;s, for an increase in efficiency of about one-third.</p> <p>The savings in carbon dioxide emissions depends on the fuel used to make the electricity. If the fuel that was saved by retiring the mower -- in this case gasoline -- was used to make the electricity, then some of the oil used to make that gasoline would be left over, and total savings in carbon dioxide would be 2.1 pounds. If the kilowatts were the national average, made from nuclear power, natural gas, hydroelectricity, coal and oil, the savings would be 2.5 pounds, he said.</p> <p>The impetus for the homeowner to switch to an electric mower would not, of course, be carbon dioxide, but rules like those in California that aim to limit conventional pollutants, like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide. The power plant would also pollute, of course, but less.</p> <p>Electrification has planet-wide potential. Chauncey Starr, an energy expert and philosopher, is fond of telling audiences that cooking dinner over an open fire, as is often done in the third world, is only 2 percent efficient. If the same wood were burned in a boiler to make electricity, it would cook 10 or 15 dinners. Dr. Starr, who founded the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility consortium in Palo Alto, Calif., uses the example to describe a strategy against deforestation, but it is obviously important as a greenhouse control strategy too.</p> <p>All of this is music to the electric-utility industry, which, with its prominent smokestacks, has become the whipping boy for greenhouse activists. In addition, while fuel use for transportation, heating, industry and other purposes has been roughly unchanged since 1973, the year of the first oil embargo, fuel use for electric utilities has been galloping ahead. Of all the fuel used in this country, about 36 percent is converted to electricity before it is used, and by the end of the decade this figure will approach 40 percent. Transportation is a distant second, at 27 percent.</p> <p>Outside experts generally agree Mr. Mills&#39;s examples are correct, although they often doubt his bottom line. But trivial as the lawn mower example may sound, the United States has about 84 million mowers.</p> <p>And many other electric technologies have great potential. Mr. Mills points out that the economy now produces far fewer pounds of carbon dioxide per dollar of gross national product. He credits electrification. For example, he cites gains from the electrification of steel, paint drying, glass production and a dozen other technologies, including document shipping, which these days often means a fax machine instead of Federal Express.</p> <p>Beyond convenience, he says, there could be another major incentive for switching to electric technologies: money. The lawn mower is a good example; nobody likes dragging a cord around and few people buy electric mowers. But over a seven-year lifetime, Mr. Mills says, using an electric lawn mower will cut carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and other pollutants by an amount that has a dollar value. If the user could capture that value, said Mr. Mills, electric mowers would become far more tempting.</p> <p>Some technologies not in the marketplace yet and unlikely to make their entry primarily to save carbon dioxide would still achieve that goal, he said. These include the following:</p> <p>* Stabilizing toxic wastes. Instead of digging up contaminated soil and hauling it to a lined dump with a water collection system, put electrodes into the soil and zap it with so much power that the soil turns to glass, immobilizing the chemicals. That would cut energy use 20 percent.</p> <p>* &quot;Flying&quot; between cities by train. Compared with an airplane, a magnetic-levitation train moving at more than 300 miles per hour would use 76 percent less energy per passenger mile, Mr. Mills calculates.</p> <p>* Driving electric cars. A nine-mile trip would save 2.4 to 3.3 pounds of carbon dioxide, depending, once again, on whether the power plant used the oil that was saved from the car or the national average fuel mix.</p> <p>According to Mr. Mills, electrification thus far is the major factor in improving the ratio of G.N.P to carbon dioxide, from 4 pounds per dollar in 1973 to about 2.3 pounds per dollar today. He recognizes two &quot;structural changes&quot; in the economy that helped the trend along: the construction since 1973 of a nuclear industry that provides about 20 percent of the nation&#39;s electricity without carbon dioxide production and the increase in auto fuel efficiency, with cars going 50 percent further on a gallon, on average. But those together account for only about 22 percent of the improvement, he said.</p> <p>Charles Komanoff, a utility expert and consultant in New York, described the ecowatts premise as &quot;credible.&quot; But other factors muddy the waters, he said.</p> <p>One reason the American economy is 30 percent more energy efficient now than it was two decades ago is that lights and refrigerators do the same work with less power, Mr. Komanoff said. This is not electrical technologies substituting for technologies that use natural gas or coal; it is new electric refrigerators substituting for old electric refrigerators.</p> <p>And there are always innovations using other fuels. The Gas Research Institute, for example, will soon test a new glass melter, powered by natural gas, that is expected to be 20 percent more efficient than conventional gas furnaces and 40 percent cheaper than a conventional electric furnace.</p> <p>There are other factors. Steel making has largely moved abroad, so the carbon dioxide accrues to some other nation. And a bigger part of the mix in the American economy are goods and services that require less energy to make and did not exist a few years ago, like computer software.</p>
1311001>La Guardia Flight Curbs Are a Help, Official Says The rationing of flights to La Guardia Airport in recent months has helped to untangle air traffic, and similar plans should be considered for other busy airports around the country, said the chairman of a House aviation subcommittee that met in New York City yesterday. Last year, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey sought to match demand to capacity at La Guardia by limiting the number of planes that could land there until a permanent plan could be worked out.  <p>The two agencies are trying to work out a system for reducing the number of planes at the airport by charging higher landing fees or imposing strict regulations.</p> <p>But there is strong opposition from airlines, and there are questions, even from the agencies themselves, about the extent of their legal authority.</p> <p>Presiding over a hearing at the World Trade Center on air traffic problems in the New York area, John L. Mica, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee, expressed strong support for stopping airlines from scheduling more flights than the F.A.A. says the airport can handle.</p> <p>He asked William R. DeCota, the Port Authority&#39;s director of aviation, how he expected to handle anticipated growth at the airport in the next few years &#39;&#39;unless you bring them in by seaplane.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. DeCota said the Port Authority would spend money to improve taxiways and terminals, but he added, &#39;&#39;Clearly, we&#39;re going to have to do something to make more efficient use of those facilities.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Mica told reporters after the meeting, &#39;&#39;You&#39;re going to be facing gridlock and meltdown in metropolitan New York City.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>He added that La Guardia and, later, airports around the country should be given the authority to limit flights. Outside of New York, he said, the caps would stay in place until airports could add new runways, but in the case of New York, there is no room for them.</p> <p>Flights to La Guardia, National Airport in Washington, O&#39;Hare in Chicago and, at certain hours, Kennedy International Airport had been limited for decades until Congress removed the restrictions beginning in March 2000. At La Guardia, the airlines added about 200 landings and takeoffs to the existing level of 1,000, and delays became extensive, causing a ripple effect nationwide.</p> <p>So the Port Authority stepped in with a moratorium on new flights, which took effect in January, an act that Mr. DeCota conceded yesterday was probably illegal. The F.A.A. then announced it would hold a lottery to limit flights to a level the airport could handle.</p> <p>The Port Authority&#39;s goal is to hold the number of landings constant and to encourage airlines to use bigger planes; the average flight now has just 70 seats, Mr. DeCota said. But that would run against a trend toward flying smaller planes with greater frequency, offering passengers more choices.</p> <p>Some airlines and elected officials contend that squeezing out smaller planes would eliminate routes to small communities. Others say limits on who can fly to La Guardia tend to favor well-entrenched airlines and limit competition. Any plan there could be a precedent for airports around the country.</p> <p>Michael D. Wascom, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, a trade group for the major carriers, said that if smaller carriers and start-up carriers were exempt from flight limits, &#39;&#39;the larger network carriers end up getting stuck with the bill.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>His association did not oppose the temporary controls now in place under the lottery, but it has not taken a position on what final controls should look like.</p> <p>While the F.A.A. and the Port Authority try to devise a system that protects small communities and start-up airlines, though, they are tentative about asserting their authority.</p> <p>Jane F. Garvey, the F.A.A. administrator, said, &#39;&#39;There was lot of debate about what legal authority the F.A.A. had, the airport authority had, but our view was if you&#39;re stuck on a tarmac for two or three hours, you&#39;re not asking who has the legal authority, you just want something done.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>At the hearing, several committee members and government officials discussed the possibility of building up alternative airports, beyond Kennedy and Newark, to handle the excess demand. Sue Kelly, who represents Westchester, said she often now flies to Washington through Kennedy, because flights from La Guardia are unreliable. &#39;&#39;I have to go on an airplane that&#39;s going to go,&#39;&#39; she said.</p> <p>She said she would like to fly through Stewart, near Newburgh, N.Y., because &#39;&#39;it&#39;s a wonderful airport, it&#39;s easy to park your car, and the people are friendly.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But to get to Washington, she would have to fly first to Raleigh/ Durham and then Charlotte, N.C. &#39;&#39;It would take me six hours,&#39;&#39; she said.</p>
1715114>Federal Report Says Delays in Cockpit Made Teterboro Crash Worse The corporate jet that went off the end of a runway at Teterboro Airport on Feb. 2, overweight and imbalanced, was tantalizingly close to being able to take off, according to documents released Monday. The crash was made worse, however, because the pilots delayed using the thrust reversers, according to investigators. A sheaf of reports released by the National Transportation Safety Board found flaws in split-second decision-making in the New Jersey airport crash, which badly injured both the pilots and two men in a sedan that the plane hit after crashing through the airport fence,.  <p>The reports also identified a variety of problems with the training of both pilots and of the &#39;&#39;cabin aide,&#39;&#39; a 22-year-old woman who had previously worked as a model and as a &#39;&#39;VIP waitress.&#39;&#39; Her brief training did not include handling a fire extinguisher or learning how to instruct passengers to assume a braced position before a crash, the reports said.</p> <p>The plane barreled across the six lanes of Route 46, slammed into parked cars and then hit a warehouse.</p> <p>The documents were described by the safety board as &#39;&#39;factual reports,&#39;&#39; without any conclusions. The board has not said when it will rule on the cause. The plane, a Canadair CL-600 Challenger, was scheduled to fly to Chicago.</p> <p>The reports said that the center of gravity was much too far forward and that the takeoff weight was 41,340 pounds, about 90 pounds over the limit.</p> <p>Seeking to determine how the plane&#39;s weight was calculated, the investigators questioned the captain, John Kimberling, about what weight he had allowed for the eight passengers. He replied that he believed the crew had allowed 170 pounds per passenger because &#39;&#39;I had small guys,&#39;&#39; according to one report. The report said the crew should have used &#39;&#39;actual passenger weights.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The investigators also found that an onboard computer had been preprogrammed with too small a figure for the empty weight of the plane, making it easier for a crew to overload the plane inadvertently.</p> <p>The airplane ran off the runway at about 126 miles per hour.</p> <p>The crew, finding that the nose did not lift off when they had expected, aborted the takeoff at about 184 m.p.h. But investigators using a simulator at the headquarters of the plane&#39;s manufacturer, Bombardier, in Montreal, found that was about the speed at which the nose would have begun to lift.</p> <p>Investigators also found a five-second gap between the time the captain decided to abort and the time that the crew used the thrust reversers, devices that redirect the two engines&#39; exhaust so that it works to slow the plane.</p> <p>In one simulation, investigators were able to stop the plane before it reached the runway end, but they were expecting a problem, the report pointed out.</p> <p>After the crash, the company that arranged the charter, Platinum Jet, was forced out of business by the Federal Aviation Administration, which said Platinum was not qualified to operate as an air carrier. The company that actually held the certificate as an air carrier, AlphaJet, a subsidiary of Darby Aviation, of Muscle Shoals, Ala., is still flying, but under an agreement with the aviation administration that it supervise its planes more closely. The company is in court with the aviation administration over the issue of whether it did anything wrong in allowing Platinum to fly the plane that crashed.</p> <p>A lawyer representing the cockpit crew and Platinum, Michael Moulis, said that the safety board had misunderstood the problem. &#39;&#39;It was not a center of gravity problem, because this plane flew like this for two years under the same condition, and never had a problem,&#39;&#39; he said in a telephone interview.</p> <p>Mr. Moulis said the board had turned the investigation of the operation of the plane over to Bombardier, because the board lacked anyone qualified to do the job. &#39;&#39;Obviously the manufacturer of an aircraft is not going to find its own plane at fault,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>But Keith Holloway, a spokesman for the board, said it had followed its usual practice of inviting organizations with expertise, including Platinum and Bombardier, to participate in the investigation under its supervision. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s still our investigation,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The captain told investigators of a jam in the cockpit device that controls the parts of the tail that make the plane pitch up. Investigators found, however, that given the total weight and distribution of the load and the way the controls were preset, the nose could not have reached takeoff angle at the speed the crew had predicted.</p>
411403>The Region; Oil Shock or No, Shoreham Is Still Heading for Oblivion ONE reason given for building the Shoreham nuclear plant was to reduce Long Island&#39;s dependence on expensive, unreliable foreign oil. Last summer, as the plant waited to be dismantled, the invasion of Kuwait doubled the price of oil on the world market, raising for a moment the possibility that the Iraqi dragon could be the savior of the distressed damsel of nuclear power. But Shoreham is as doomed as ever. On Friday the Long Island Power Authority voted to submit a decommissioning plan to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The reasons that Iraq finally did not make a difference will loom large in the nation&#39;s energy situation for years to come.  <p>The first is that nuclear plants do not replace the whole barrel of oil, only the part that is typically used in big power plants. That is the heavy end, what is left over after refineries have removed the molecules used for more valuable products, like gasoline, jet fuel and heating oil. And heavy oil is plentiful.</p> <p>When traders thought supplies were short, they quickly bid up the price of the light products far more than the heavy. The light, low-sulfur crude oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, for example, went from under $20 at the beginning of July, before Iraq&#39;s saber rattling, to a peak of over $41 in October. But the price shift in the oil bought by Lilco was much smaller: from $16 before the crisis to about $26 at the peak.</p> <p>Morris J. Greenberg, vice president of the WEFA Group, a consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said that heavy oil &quot;is one of the easiest of all petroleum products to find substitutes for, particularly natural gas.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;There are surplus supplies of gas still available, and more coming onto the market,&quot; he said. During the Persian Gulf crisis, the price of gas has risen only modestly above the normal seasonal fluctuation.</p> <p>And more gas is coming to Long Island. As the oil markets were rising, the Iroquois pipeline, which would carry gas from the Trans Canada Pipeline across Long Island Sound, was collecting key approvals; most experts think its construction is a certainty now. More Megawatts</p> <p>In addition, over the last five years Lilco, despairing of ever running Shoreham, has added far more capacity than the 800 megawatts the plant would have provided. It reactivated its Far Rockaway generating station, adding 100 megawatts. It increased the output of other plants by 95 megawatts. It developed a way to keep its plants on line 90 percent to 95 percent of the time, above the national average, effectively adding 300 megawatts. It built three small combustion turbines in Brookhaven, giving another 240 megawatts. And by installing high-efficiency equipment on customers&#39; premises and radio-controlled shut-off switches on pool pumps and home air conditioners, Lilco cut peak load by 188 megawatts.</p> <p>It was not only improved efficiency that helped lower demand; recession contributed, too.</p> <p>&quot;It would have been good business to have Shoreham,&quot; said Richard J. Rudden, an energy consultant based in Hauppauge and a former Con Ed executive. But now, he said, &quot;the capacity is not required.&quot;</p> <p>This does not mean that the price increase was without costs for Long Island. Joseph W. McDonnell, a Lilco vice president, said that fuel comes to about 30 percent of utility costs, so the 60 percent increase in oil paid by the company would have resulted in an 18 percent rise for customers without mitigating factors.</p> <p>But Lilco cut oil use bybuying power made from coal or other sources from other utilities and by burning more natural gas in its own plants. Oil produced 59 percent of the company&#39;s power in July but only 46 percent in November.</p> <p>Also holding down the price increase was Lilco&#39;s annual switch to winter rates. So the total increase for customers was about 3.7 percent.</p> <p>Dr. McDonnell, asked what difference Shoreham would have made, said that if it ran as well as the average American nuclear plant, it would have produced about 25 percent of the power that Lilco needs, cutting oil consumption by more than half. But he turned down an opportunity to say that this was a good idea.</p> <p>When the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves Lilco&#39;s application to demote Shoreham from its status as an operable reactor, the plant can be sold to the Long Island Power Authority; in the meantime, the plant cost ratepayers $150 million in 1990.</p> <p>Operators still practice startup and shutdown procedures in a computerized simulator so they can pass their annual licensing exams, but many of those who would be required to run the plant are long gone. Of the 1,100 Lilco and contractor employees who were there in May 1989, when the agreement for abandonment was reached with New York State, nearly half have left, including &quot;a number of people who felt their career path was in the nuclear area,&quot; Dr. McDonnell said.</p> <p>The prospects for the nuclear industry as a whole do not seem to have improved much from the third oil shock, either. It would take prices approaching $100 to make some of the plants finished in the 1980&#39;s, after multibillion-dollar overruns, look like good investments. Building new nuclear plants at prices now prevailing would be like conserving dog food by substituting sirloin.</p> <p>Said Mr. Greenberg: &quot;Even if relative fuel prices appeared to justify new nuclear plants, it would be very difficult for private utilities to go ahead and finance a power plant right now. Investors are not going to be excited about it.&quot;</p>
868821>Plane Crashes and Politics;The Latest Casualties Are Factual The day after T.W.A. Flight 800 exploded in the skies south of Long Island July 17, the local congressman announced that one of the black boxes had been found. Over the next few days, the President&#39;s chief of staff said investigators were looking closely for signs of terrorism and had detected &quot;chemical leftovers&quot; on plane debris. The Governor told the world, including the anxious families, that divers had found &quot;dozens and dozens&quot; of additional bodies. At the time, all of the statements were wrong. The people who usually disseminate information after such incidents, the investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, said little publicly.  <p>The hours after a plane crashes are a time of information chaos, a torrent of purported facts, many of which turn out to be false. But in this crash and the last big one, the Valujet DC-9 that plunged into the Everglades in May, something more has been happening: culture clash.</p> <p>On one side are the old hands in aviation who know where the answers are. In  this case the answers are in the debris nine miles offshore and 120 feet down, waiting to be pried from the sea by divers and decoded by metallurgists, chemists and computer specialists. It could take months.</p> <p>Grounded</p> <p>On the other side are elected officials, who are of late drawn to such accidents to see and be seen, to offer comfort to the victims and reassurance to the public and press. Flanked by cameras and microphones, they eagerly spout information, even if it later turns out to be false.</p> <p>The approach has its perils, as Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena discovered after going to the Everglades in mid-May to declare that Valujet was  safe. The airline was grounded weeks later.</p> <p>Thrown into the mix of agencies and politicians in the T.W.A. crash is a top  F.B.I. official who acknowledges that he has never dealt with a plane that crashed in water. Yet by its size alone the F.B.I. has come to dominate the investigation even though it is not in charge unless foul play is officially determined.</p> <p>F.B.I. involvement has created several sources of information where usually there is only one, the safety board. The N.T.S.B. is a jealous agency that has in the past given an unceremonious boot to officials of other agencies who disclose any findings. Last year, it yanked a New York State investigator off a  subway collision case because he persisted in publicly offering theories and explanations before the board was ready.</p> <p>In the case of T.W.A. flight 800, the board has been unable to turn away high-ranking elected officials, who may misspeak or not fully understand what technical experts have told them. The resulting spectacle had the Federal official in charge of the recovery and investigation, Robert T. Francis of the safety board, announcing that human remains were being brought to the surface as fast as possible while Governor George E. Pataki was implying that large amounts of human remains were being bypassed.</p> <p>The White House finally stepped in, to impose discipline, if not necessarily  order, on the flow of information. President Clinton contradicted his chief of staff, Leon Panetta,after Mr. Panetta&#39;s comments on terrorism and cautioned against premature conclusions. Then Mr. Panetta met with the chairman of the safety board, James Hall, and officials of other agencies to resolve what Mr. Francis later called the &quot;furor&quot; of conflicting information.</p> <p>Mr. Francis then stated publicly and sternly that his agency would be making  the announcements -- although in theory it had been all along. Mr. Pataki said later he had given out the information as he understood it at the time. In a separate news conference, Mr. Francis said, &quot;Miscommunications are always unfortunate.&quot; An Information Fix</p> <p>But the board&#39;s information system, some of its officials realize, is outmoded. The cycle of sending people into the field every morning and holding a progress meeting every evening followed by a news conference at 8 or 9, worked better before the age of all-news television. And in this crash, there is even less tolerance than usual for the normal delays of an aircraft investigation, and a sense that the trail of the bad guys (if they exist) is growing cold.</p> <p>But if politicians are tempted to step in again, they might consider the fate of Mr. Pena. At a recent Senate Commerce Committee hearing, he was quizzed by Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, who was on the safety board in the mid-1970&#39;s. During her tenure, she said, secretaries of transportation never went to crashes -- why did he?</p> <p>Mr. Pena said he went to make it clear that the safety board is in charge. The Senator replied that the board had always performed well for itself.</p> <p>Ms. Hutchison said that Mr. Pena should think about leaving the safety board  to do its job, &quot;without calling press conferences that tend to confuse the situation.&quot;</p>
34903>STATES PURSUE SUNKEN LOOT, REAL AND ARCHEOLOGICAL TO the treasure hunters who scour the seas for gold bullion and pieces of eight, sunken ships mean adventure and dreams of sudden wealth. But to scientists and historians, the wrecks are &#39;&#39;underwater archeological resources,&#39;&#39; as worthy of preservation as Plymouth Rock.  <p>States such as Massachusetts and Florida, whose coastal waters harbor submerged treasure, are interested in both the real and the historical riches. Recently they have been seeking more power to protect the underwater ruins and to share in the artifacts and precious metals that salvagers hope to find.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Some of these sites are time capsules,&#39;&#39; said James J. Miller, director of Florida&#39;s Bureau of Archeological Research. &#39;&#39;These shipwrecks have the potential to give information that can&#39;t be gotten from any other source on the early centuries of settlement in the New World.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Last week, a House subcommittee heard testimony on a bill that would give states title to the wrecks. This would allow them to regulate salvage operations, protecting the remains and negotiating with the finders for a share of the treasure. &#39;&#39;Historical artifacts in state waters are no different than historical artifacts on land,&#39;&#39; said Representative Charles Bennett, a Florida Democrat and chief sponsor of the bill, which has been endorsed by the Reagan Administration. &#39;&#39;Imagine someone trying to sell chunks off Plymouth Rock,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It is the type of thing we leave our historic shipwrecks open to.&#39;&#39; (Plymouth Rock was, in fact, reduced by more than half its size by souvenir hunters during the 1800&#39;s before it was finally fenced in.) The day after the hearing in Washington, the battle over the shipwrecks resurfaced in Superior Court in Boston, where the State of Massachusetts is fighting Barry Clifford, a professional treasure hunter, over one of the most spectacular finds in years. The Whydah, a slave ship hijacked by Samuel (Black Sam) Bellamy on its maiden voyage, cruised around the Caribbean plundering ships before running aground on Cape Cod in 1717. Two hundred and fifty years later the Whydah&#39;s wood is mostly gone, and its cargo, consisting of pieces of eight, gold dust, iron cannons and brass fittings, is scattered and buried under about five feet of shifting sand a mile off the Cape. Massachusetts wants to put the salvagers under control of the state Board of Underwater Archeological Resources and require them to surrender 25 percent of the value of the find. Salvagers like Mr. Clifford and his company, Maritime Underwater Surveys, object to being portrayed as contemporary plunderers. While they concede that they hope to make a lot of money, they argue that without their skill, luck and willingness to take risks, the wrecks would never be found. The work on the Whydah, which involves pushing sand away with giant propellers, has been meticulous, said Mr. Clifford&#39;s lawyer, James P. McMahon. Respect for the ship&#39;s remains is partly a matter of enlightened self-interest. &#39;&#39;By convincing the scientific community that what they&#39;ve brought up is the Whydah,&#39;&#39; Mr. McMahon said, &#39;&#39;it raises the value of the find.&#39;&#39; Mr. Clifford has said that he would like to establish a museum in Boston, though he and his investors also hope to profit by selling artifacts.</p> <p>In 1981, Florida, citing a state statute, moved against salvagers and claimed title to a shipwreck. But the state was overruled in Federal District Court when a judge concluded that Federal admiralty law and its &#39;&#39;finders-keepers&#39;&#39; principle took precedence over state law. Since then, Florida has been seeking to negotiate with salvagers to insure that they follow archeological guidelines.</p> <p>The Florida decision is binding only in the district in which it was made. Without a clear precedent, the status of laws in more than 20 other states is unclear. In the Massachusetts case, Carolyn V. Wood, an assistant attorney general, argued that the Federal Submerged Lands Act of 1953 gives the state title to land within three miles of shore. But legal arguments centered on whether the law, which Congress passed in response to a California dispute on offshore drilling, would cover shipwrecks. The Bennett bill would insure that the Federal Government has title to the wrecks, which it would then transfer to the states. But the law would not be retroactive.</p> <p>While Congress debates, technical advances make the issue more pressing. Using new sonar techniques, salvagers can produce maps on which sunken ships are visible and can even find wrecks embedded below the surface of the ocean floor.</p>
1760531>New Recipe For Gasoline Helped Drive Up the Price Nine months after Congress passed major energy legislation, one provision affecting gasoline formulas is helping to drive the price of gas up much faster than the rising price of crude oil. And because the new gasoline recipe contains less energy, mileage per gallon is declining.  <p>On Friday, the 270th day after President Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the law ended the requirement that gasoline sold in areas prone to air pollution include an &#39;&#39;oxygenate,&#39;&#39; or a molecule including hydrogen, carbon and oxygen. A result is that refiners over most of the country&#39;s big gasoline markets, anticipating the rule, have already dropped the chemical MTBE.</p> <p>The refiners were not explicitly required to drop MTBE, but virtually all have done so because it has polluted groundwater and exposed them to liability suits. By dropping it, they can offer the defense in water pollution lawsuits that they used the component only for as long as it was required.</p> <p>Until the oxygen requirement was eliminated, refiners had made gasoline with 11 percent MTBE by volume. &#39;&#39;MTBE is not a tiny little additive that you add with an eye dropper,&#39;&#39; said James P. Lucier, an analyst at Prudential Equity Group.</p> <p>But now refiners must replace that ingredient. And they need a substitute that is also high octane, as MTBE is.</p> <p>To replace it, refiners have turned in part to ethanol, which is also an oxygenate but not a pollution worry.</p> <p>Ethanol, which is made from corn, costs more than gasoline, though, and shipping it from the Midwest, where it is made, is cumbersome and expensive, because it has to go by barge, railroad tank car or tanker truck, rather than pipeline.</p> <p>Along with importing vast amounts of crude oil, the United States imports more than a million barrels a day of gasoline or gasoline ingredients. The loss of the MTBE now requires more of those imports. Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a nonprofit group in New York, said tight refinery capacity helped to explain why the price of gasoline had increased so much faster than the price of crude oil.</p> <p>West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark oil, was up only about 39 cents a gallon last month compared with April 2005, while the wholesale price of gasoline rose about 64 cents over the same period. Mr. Goldstein blames the loss of MTBE for the difference.</p> <p>Experts at the Energy Department, the refiners&#39; trade association and elsewhere agree that the changeover from MTBE was a factor, although they differ about the amount.</p> <p>Experts say part of the problem was that the law specified that the changeover would happen on the 270th day after signing, without its authors knowing when the bill would be passed and signed. As it happens, the 270th day coincides with the seasonal price rise that comes each year when refineries shut down equipment to shift to the typical mix of products sold in summer.</p> <p>After Hurricane Katrina, some refineries skipped maintenance last fall to make up for lost production; that has led to longer shutdowns now.</p> <p>At the Energy Information Administration, part of the Energy Department, Joanne Shore, a senior analyst who specializes in gasoline, said, &#39;&#39;The market has tightened, because of all the things that have to be done to gasoline,&#39;&#39; including transition to summer gas and the phasing out of MTBE.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There is a transition issue,&#39;&#39; Ms. Shore said.</p> <p>But she said the 35-cent estimate was too high.</p> <p>Ethanol is pricey and energy-poor. Its price is up by about $1.30 a gallon in the last year, in part because of heavy demand for something to replace MTBE. But ethanol has only about two-thirds as much energy as MTBE does.</p> <p>Charles T. Drevna, executive vice president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, said refiners had faced tough decisions in the late winter and early spring, because the law specified that the oxygenate requirement be dropped on the 270th day, but the refiners were not sure whether the Environmental Protection Agency would publish the regulation that carries out the law on schedule. (It did.)</p> <p>So the refiners, eager to get rid of MTBE but unsure whether they would still face a requirement for oxygenated gasoline, scrambled to line up supplies of ethanol.</p> <p>The oxygenate requirement has been obsolete for years. It was intended to make the fuel mix leaner, reducing air pollution. But that works only on older cars, with carburetors, not in modern vehicles with oxygen sensors and fuel injectors.</p>
625445>Keeping It to a Low Roar; New York City Tries Electronic Muzzles to Zap Bus Noise Watch out, Klingons, a new cloaking technology is in the field. It helps hide a city bus. The technology is an &quot;anti-noise generator,&quot; a computer-driven, 220-watt speaker in the tailpipe of a bus that emits sound waves to partially cancel exhaust noise. The New York City Transit Authority is testing the device, also called an electronic muffler, in four buses.  <p>It will not turn a 41-seat city bus into a match for the Klingon warships that make themselves invisible on &quot;Star Trek,&quot; but it does help eliminate sound, especially the low-frequency sound that travels farthest and rattles windows along the street as buses pass.</p> <p>With an electronic muffler, a bus &quot;doesn&#39;t sound as heavy as the normal bus,&quot; said Charles E. Boston, driving a test bus up the East Side of Manhattan yesterday. The Muffler as Mimic</p> <p>The Transit Authority&#39;s goal for the muffler goes beyond cutting noise. By replacing the conventional muffler, which is a maze of sound-absorbing baffles, the electronic muffler makes it easier for the bus to emit exhaust, thus raising horsepower or increasing fuel economy.</p> <p>The muffler works by analyzing the sound waves and mimicking them, sending out waves of the same frequency and amplitude, but out of step. The technique is a little like that of a parent who quiets the splashing of a child at one end of a bathtub by making waves at the other end.</p> <p>The devices being tested in New York were invented by Noise Cancellation Technologies Inc. of Stamford, Conn. They were installed by Walker Noise Cancellation Technologies, a joint venture of the Stamford company and Walker Manufacturing, a division of Tenneco that says it is the world&#39;s largest manufacturer of conventional mufflers.</p> <p>Walker Noise Cancellation says its muffler will cut fuel consumption by 3.5 percent. This may not sound like much, but New York City buses average 2.9 miles per gallon in stop-and-go traffic and travel 30,000 miles a year, meaning a savings of nearly 350 gallons annually. The Transit Authority has 3,700 buses that run on a form of diesel fuel that lately has cost the city 65 to 75 cents a gallon. Wooing Transit Companies</p> <p>Walker sold the first four mufflers to the city for $1,100 each, which a company representative said was a generous price to induce New York to get involved. The company&#39;s goal is to get enough operating experience to prove that the mufflers work, then persuade bus manufacturers to build them into their designs.</p> <p>Houston and two transit systems in Southern California have placed small orders for the mufflers, a Walker representative said, and others are negotiating.</p> <p>The transit systems are generally most interested in the mufflers as a means to save fuel. In New York, Charles Seaton, a spokesman for the Transit Authority, said that &quot;it would be hard to tell with the naked ear&quot; whether the mufflers make buses quieter, and that their main advantage is efficiency.</p> <p>Scott H. Buehrer, a spokesman for Walker, said the electronic muffler is especially helpful at low frequencies below 500 hertz, a tone roughly equivalent to the B below middle C on the piano. In other words, it lessens the rumble, not the whine.  The technology is already used in factories to reduce the drone from vacuum or blower fans. Walker says it is also working on a version to use in an airplane to blank out engine noise.</p> <p>But buses are a harder task, because their speed, and hence the pitch of their engines, keeps changing. &quot;We love fixed r.p.m.,&quot; said Ross B. Gordon, the national account manager at Walker.</p> <p>The first electronic muffler was installed on a New York bus about four months ago, yielding an immediate increase in horsepower of about 4.5 percent, Mr. Buehrer said. But the buses have about 255 horsepower and do not need more, according to the Transit Authority, which would rather take the efficiency gain as fuel savings. So the authority recently installed smaller fuel injectors in the buses with electronic mufflers, restoring the horsepower to the original level and increasing fuel economy.</p> <p>Measuring the mufflers&#39; effect will take several months, said Andrew S. J. Skabowski, an engineer at the Transit Authority, because fuel economy varies with traffic, temperature, the habits of the bus driver and how many people are aboard.</p> <p>But Mr. Skabowski said he had high hopes. &quot;If it works without a lot of repairs, we&#39;re looking at savings,&quot; he said.</p> <p>With the muffling technology in hand, engineers say they may eventually look at other places to reduce bus noise, including the transmission, drivetrain and fans or air-conditioning compressor.</p> <p>But then there is that special clunk, rattle and jingle of the bus hitting potholes. The solution for that, experts say, does not lie with the bus.</p>
866433>Ex-Inspector Tells Senators About Suspicions on Valujet The former Inspector General of the Transportation Department said today that the department&#39;s chief of staff had responded to her suspicions of safety problems at Valujet by telling her about the airline&#39;s complaints about her investigation. The former official, Mary Schiavo, testified before the Senate Commerce Committee that the conversation contributed to her feeling that Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena was not paying attention to her safety concerns and was one reason she quit her job last month, four months after the Feb. 22 meeting.  <p>She said she also took it as a sign that the Federal Aviation Administration was providing confidential information about her safety investigation to Valujet. One of the commuter airline&#39;s planes crashed in the Everglades on May 11, killing 110 people</p> <p>Appearing earlier before the same committee, Mr. Pena said Ms. Schiavo had never complained to him about her concerns.</p> <p>But Mr. Pena did say he had been disturbed by an opinion column that Ms. Schiavo wrote in Newsweek magazine shortly after the Valujet crash, in which she said she avoided commuter airlines in general and Valujet in particular.</p> <p>&quot;I was very troubled and surprised that she would write an article like that  for a national review without having brought it to my attention first,&quot; Mr. Pena said.</p> <p>Members of Congress and others have questioned whether the administration and its parent agency, the Transportation Department, had overlooked signs of safety problems at Valujet, which was grounded indefinitely by the F.A.A. on June 17, five weeks after the crash. Mr. Pena in particular has been criticized for asserting soon after the crash that Valujet was safe.</p> <p>The president and chief operating officer of Valujet, Lewis Jordan, also testified today and said he hoped to have the airline return to service in early August.</p> <p>Air safety is primarily the domain of F.A.A. inspectors and regulators. The Inspector General of the Transportation Department is responsible for monitoring the honesty and effectiveness of the aviation agency, and by extension safety matters, as well as other parts of the overall department.</p> <p>Ms. Schiavo said that she had met with her staff on Feb. 6, three months before the crash, to discuss their concerns about Valujet&#39;s safety and the F.A.A.&#39;s oversight of the airline. The next day, she said, some staff members went to Atlanta, where Valujet is based, to meet with regional F.A.A. officials.</p> <p>Two weeks later, she said, she briefed Mr. Pena&#39;s chief of staff, Ann M. Bormolini, about the topic in a weekly meeting that she said Mr. Pena had established as the channel through which she should report to him.</p> <p>&quot;I had briefed her on our concerns,&quot; Ms. Schiavo said. &quot;I told her we were interested. I told her we had had a meeting in my office, and we were worried about Valujet.&quot;</p> <p>Ms. Schiavo said Ms. Bormolini responded by saying that a lobbyist friend for Valujet had called and indicated that the Inspector General&#39;s office was &quot;snooping around.&quot;</p> <p>Ms. Schiavo said she was &quot;quite floored&quot; by Ms. Bormolini&#39;s response. &quot;I thought that was highly irregular,&quot; she said.</p> <p>Ms. Bormolini, who had been an aide to Mr. Pena since he was Mayor of Denver, quit her job to return to Denver soon after the crash, according to the Transportation Department. In a statement through the department, she said that  the lobbyist friend had asked her whether the Inspector General was investigating Valujet, and that she had passed the question along to Ms. Schiavo. Ms. Bormolini also said that she had asked Ms. Schiavo &quot;whether or not it was appropriate for me to obtain and/or share this information,&quot; and that Ms. Schiavo had said it was not.</p> <p>Ms. Bormolini&#39;s statement did not say what, if anything, Ms. Schiavo told her about safety at Valujet.</p> <p>Ms. Schiavo had previously said that the Inspector General&#39;s office was conducting a criminal investigation into whether F.A.A. inspectors were told to  &quot;go easy&quot; on Valujet in the weeks before the crash, and that she had excused herself from that investigation because she anticipated being called as a witness in the case.</p> <p>Today she said that it was her conversation with Ms. Bormolini that she expected to be used as evidence in that case.</p>
302208>At Last, a Practical Electric Vehicle? In the quest for clean air, the utility industry today introduced a high-technology entry to curb pollution from autos: an electric van that speeds along at up to 72 miles an hour, and can run for more than 100 miles without having to be recharged.  <p>The shiny maroon vehicle, housed in the body of a Chrysler van, is a prototype that the producers hope will be in production in about three years. But at a national conference here, begun today, the Electric Power Research Institute also showed off less advanced models based on the body of a General Motors van, which customers can order today for delivery next year.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Go out and kick the tires -they&#39;re real,&#39;&#39; said Richard E. Balzhiser, president of the power research institute, which is sponsoring the two-day conference. Long a Dream</p> <p>Replacing gasoline with electricity in vehicles has been talked about and tinkered with since the early days of the automobile, and particularly since the 1973 oil embargo. But the cars have never had the range or durability to be very useful. Today, however, improved technology and the prospects of tougher environmental enforcement are beginning to make electric vehicles look more practical.</p> <p>Moreover, even advocates concede that electric vehicles will be a modest niche market for the foreseeable future, mainly used as delivery trucks, service vans and the like that travel short distances each day. Optimists predict that the potential market is more 100,000 electric vehicles a year, compared with a total American market of 15 million cars and light trucks.</p> <p>Still, the first factory production of an electric vehicle in North America in recent years, with the General Motors van body, is scheduled to begin in May. The power research group, a nonprofit utility consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif., hopes to sell 500 next year.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We are looking for a foot in the door that will convince the population,&#39;&#39; Mr. Balzhiser said.</p> <p>According to C. Dennis Bausch, a vice president of Vehma International Inc., a developer of the General Motors-based van, North American production of the G.M. Vandura, the Ford Econoline and the Chrysler Ram models comes to 440,000 a year. Half are for commercial use and, he estimated, electric vans could substitute for perhaps half of those -120,000 a year.. Clean-Air Campaigns</p> <p>The main force behind the push for electric vehicles is that clean air is suddenly a national priority. Nearly 60 percent of the population of the United States lives in areas that do not meet Federal clear air standards. One area that violates the standards, Los Angeles, has mandated that 40 percent of passenger vehicles and 70 percent of freight vehicles run on clean fuels by the year 2000. And Glenn Barr, a Los Angeles Deputy Councilman, said the vehicles shown here demonstrated that the technology exists to make those vehicles electric.</p> <p>In fact, the higher-technology Chrylser-body van, still a prototype, shows that substantial progress has been made. Its nickel-iron batteries are 30 percent lighter than standard lead-acid batteries storing the same amount of power, an important consideration since a heavier battery means more energy to move the vehicle, and therefore less range. And the fuel economy of the new van is half a kilowatt-hour per mile, a substantial improvement over earlier models.</p> <p>The model about to enter production is known as the G-Van, after General Motors&#39; designation of the body style. It was developed by the power research institute; Vehma, a subsidiary of the Magna International Company, a Toronto-based auto parts maker; Chloride EV Systems, which made the batteries, and General Motors, with support from the Southern California Edison Company.</p> <p>Although it uses lead-acid batteries, it also represents technical progress. In test rides today, it accelerated acceptably, but designers are still working on the whine of the motor. It&#39;s Not Cheap</p> <p>Like all electrics, this van uses no energy when it is not moving, in contrast to internal combustion engines, which continue to burn fuel while idling. Thus, the advantage of electric vehicles is magnified as traffic worsens, engineers say. But it had better have an advantage, because it sells for $32,000, roughly double the cost of a four-cylinder gasoline model.</p> <p>Yet with opinion polls showing a popular willingness to spend more to protect the environment, the appeal of the electric vehicle is obvious. The vehicles produce no pollution at the point of use, and the power plants that supply them are substantially cleaner sources of energy than gasoline engines. The research institute, comparing the G.M.-based electric van with its gasoline cousin, found a 97 percent reduction in pollution.</p> <p>The attraction is obvious for the utilities, too. A single electric car would use about one and a half times as much electricity as a typical household, said Lawrence Hamlin, manager of research at Southern California Edison. The utility has enough slack capacity to run 600,000 vehicles, which would add $90 million a year to profits, Mr. Hamlin said.</p> <p>The new Chrysler-based van is meant to be charged by a 220-volt circuit - the kind used in households to run electric ovens or central air-conditioning - at 40 amperes. That amount of electricity is the rough equivalent of running every electric-using device in a typical house. Some industry officials foresee more advanced technologies, like power lines buried in the pavement from which cars pick up electricity..</p> <p>First, however, the business is struggling to get off the ground. The van will be sold through General Motors dealerships. Marketing plans for the Chrysler-based van are less certain.</p> <p>In the face of that uncertainty, however, there is appetite. Martin F. Gitten, a spokesman for Con Edison, said his company had already tested some cars converted to electricity, and &#39;&#39;everywhere you took them, it was like the Pied Piper of Hamlin, it drew a crowd.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There is a public fascination,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;All we need now is the technology.&#39;&#39;</p>
389428>Fuel Stocks For Winter Called Good Supplies of all fuels except propane are likely to be adequate this winter, but prices for both home-heating oil and gasoline are likely to rise significantly, according to experts at a conference here on the winter fuel outlook.  <p>Prices for oil products are higher abroad and are likely to drive United States prices up, the experts said. In Japan, for example, gasoline prices have climbed by almost 50 cents a gallon, while American prices are up only about 25 cents. If such an increase took hold in the United States, gasoline could approach $1.70 a gallon.</p> <p>Two months after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which took about 4.5 million barrels of oil a day off the world market, the disruption is not reflected in physical stocks here, said John H. Lichtblau, the chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, which co-sponsored the session with the Energy Department.</p> <p>&#39;Everything Is Normal&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If not for the Middle East situation, we could look at the numbers, at the stock levels, and see that everything is normal and supplies are quite adequate even for a colder-than-normal winter,&#39;&#39; Mr. Lichtblau said.</p> <p>Crude stocks, in fact, are 33 million barrels, or about 10 percent, above normal, and stocks of distillate oil, which is used both for diesel fuel and heating oil, are about about 20 million barrels, or about 17 percent, above last year&#39;s level.</p> <p>Jet fuel stocks are slightly higher than last year. Gasoline stocks are slightly below normal, but not enough to worry about, according to Energy Department officials.</p> <p>More Than 40 Cents in Europe</p> <p>But according to the Energy Department, American gasoline prices are up only about 25 cents, but they are up by more than 40 cents a gallon in Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands and by about 50 cents in Japan. The global price of crude oil is up by more than 40 cents a gallon.</p> <p>In heating oil, the price is up about 25 cents a gallon in the United States but is up by more than 30 cents in the other countries.</p> <p>On average, said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, &#39;&#39;light&#39;&#39; products like distillate and gasoline are selling for $10 more a barrel in East Asia than in the United States. The price difference means that cargoes that in normal times would have come to the United States will go to where the price is higher, and the price here will have to rise. &#39;&#39;In a commodity market, a supply dislocation anywhere is a price increase everywhere,&#39;&#39; he added.</p> <p>In contrast, Michael I. German, senior vice president of the American Gas Assocation, said that &#39;&#39;we see no significant movement in retail gas prices whatsoever.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Propane, meanwhile, is in abnormally short supply for reasons only distantly related to the Middle East. Because the price of propane has been lower than that of oil, according to experts, it has been very popular in a non-energy use, as a feedstock for petrochemicals. This situation prevailed even before the recent doubling of crude oil costs.</p> <p>&#39;Red Flag&#39; for Propane</p> <p>Jimmie L. Petersen, the director of the Office of Oil and Gas of the Energy Information Administration, a part of the Department of Energy, said he was marking the propane situation &#39;&#39;with a red flag.&#39;&#39; Propane is used for heating homes in areas not served by natural gas pipelines, as well as in crop drying.</p> <p>Propane stocks were at 53 million barrels as of Sept. 21, down from 60.4 million a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration. But the figure measures only &#39;&#39;primary&#39;&#39; stocks of producers and refiners, and officials say, hopefully, that perhaps some propane customers that were caught short in last December&#39;s cold snap were now holding extra-large inventories as a precaution.</p> <p>Dependent on Crude Supply</p> <p>The estimate of adequate heating oil supplies relies mainly on uninterrupted supplies of crude oil. Ron Planting, senior analyst at the American Petroleum Institute, said that 88 percent of supplies are made during the winter, from refineries; only 5 percent come from stocks. The balance comes from imports, he said.</p> <p>By the count of the Department of Energy, world oil production this month will be about 1.8 million barrels a day under what it was before the United States imposed an embargo on oil from Iraq and Kuwait, and by December the deficit will be a million barrels.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We expect that the worst part of the supply loss is past,&#39;&#39; said Dr. Mark E. Rodekohr, director of the International and Contingency Information Division of the Energy Information Administration, who added that commercial stocks could make up the difference. But he and others noted the tendency of commercial users to hold onto stocks.</p>
186276>The Shoreham Paradox; While Closer Than Ever to Getting License, A-Plant Has Lost Much of Its Value to Lilco The Long Island Lighting Company has coveted an operating license for its Shoreham Nuclear Power Station for 20 years, but as it nears its goal the utility is showing ambivalence, simultaneously seeking permission to open Shoreham while patiently awaiting approval of an agreement to abandon it.  <p>Even if it obtains a license to raise Shoreham to full power, Lilco has said it will not operate the $5.3 billion, 800-megawatt reactor as long as the agreement with New York State to abandon the plant is still up for approval by its shareholders and the state.</p> <p>On Monday, when Lilco finally received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to schedule a shareholders meeting for Nov. 4, a deadline of sorts was also set: If the state does not act, the tentative agreement allows Lilco to withdraw from it 14 days after its shareholders vote. But Lilco, having pursued its &#39;&#39;dual track&#39;&#39; to keep open the option of operating the plant while negotiating with the state to abandon it, may be prepared to wait longer. A Change of Heart</p> <p>Lilco executives, like businessmen anywhere, have not bared their goals and negotiating strategy to the public. But some of their thinking can be discerned from their actions, their statements and from talking to experts in the field.</p> <p>Not rushing toward commercial operation reflects a change of heart. In the early 1980&#39;s, when Lilco won a license for low-power operation, it quickly moved ahead, even though such operation substantially increased the cost of an abandonment.</p> <p>Operating the plant has been the central imperative of the utility, which plowed ahead through years of difficult engineering and construction and ripping out and rebuilding, all the while ignoring the critics who predicted that Shoreham could reduce Lilco to penury.</p> <p>Now that the opponents have been proved right - Lilco has indeed been impoverished by Shoreham&#39;s soaring costs, in part because of the delays the critics caused - Lilco is holding off claiming its prize because the reactor no longer offers the benefits it once promised.</p> <p>Experts on utility operations say that the difference between abandoning the plant and operating it would not be as stark as it would seem at first glance. Engineers would lament destroying an unused machine, but even if an operating license is granted, further legal challenges by the state and Suffolk County could delay its opening for years more. The state and the county oppose Shoreham on the ground that Long Island could not be evacuated safely in a nuclear accident.</p> <p>In addition, regulatory decisions and the negotiations with the state have already reduced the financial importance of opening the plant. And starting up the huge reactor would introduce new problems for Lilco&#39;s thinly stretched power network. Delay in Legislature</p> <p>The current delay is in the State Legislature. Long Island legislators contend that the settlement is too generous to Lilco. The utility, uncharacteristically, has waited patiently, although the period between Election Day and Inauguration Day could be critical for Shoreham.</p> <p>After Election Day, when the votes of Long Islanders are not a pressing concern to the Republican Party, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may feel less constrained about licensing the plant. After Inauguration Day, its view of Shoreham may change, especially if the new President is Michael S. Dukakis, who is far less sympathetic to the nuclear industry than the Reagan Administration has been.</p> <p>But Lilco does not seem to think it urgent that the commission decide soon. One reason may be that a court challenge to a license is likely, throwing doubt on just when the plant would operate. But perhaps most striking among the probable reasons for Lilco&#39;s patience is that the plant&#39;s fate means much less to the utility than almost anyone could have imagined a few years ago. Cost Already Reduced</p> <p>Normally, utilities earn nothing on their investments in generating stations until those plants enter service, at which time rates rise to reflect the investment plus a rate of return. But in Shoreham&#39;s case, the $5.3 billion cost has already been whittled to about $2 billion.</p> <p>That is because the State Public Service Commission ruled in 1986 that Lilco had imprudently spent $1.4 billion, mostly through mismanagement of construction, and that that amount could not be passed on to consumers.</p> <p>The commission, however, also decided that regardless of what revenue Lilco could expect under traditional rate-making procedures, the utility should not go bankrupt. So it put another $1.9 billion of Shoreham&#39;s cost into the formula used to calculate rates, even though the plant was not running. As a result, Lilco is already earning a return on that part of Shoreham, about $400 million a year.</p> <p>In addition, the agreement with the state, under which Lilco would sell Shoreham to the state for $1, calls for rate increases of 5 percent a year for the first three years and of about that much for seven more years. The increases are about what Lilco would have received under a &#39;&#39;Shoreham phase-in plan&#39;&#39; developed two years ago by the Public Service Commission to include the plant&#39;s costs in rates without too much shock to consumers. The Public Relations Factor</p> <p>If there is no major financial difference, there are nonfinancial gains to abandoning Shoreham. One is public image; although it has not always been obvious in recent years, utilities prize their relationship with the public.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If they close the reactor,&#39;&#39; said one executive of a utility with nuclear plants in the New York metropolitan region, &#39;&#39;people will stop bashing them over the head.&#39;&#39; Another utility executive said that if Lilco gives up on Shoreham, &#39;&#39;it will be like the Marshall Plan, with Lilco as the defeated country.&#39;&#39; For the first time in years, Lilco could have the cooperation of the Public Service Commission and local governments.</p> <p>Part of that image is the reliability of electric supply. Since the early 70&#39;s, Lilco has argued that completing Shoreham was necessary to avoid imminent summer brownouts and blackouts. If such events come after Shoreham is shut by an agreement, Lilco can say, &#39;&#39;I told you so.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Alternatively, even if Shoreham did begin commercial operation, there is a fair chance it would still be unavailable on peak days, posing other problems for Lilco.</p> <p>Reactors like Shoreham are generally available for use less than 60 percent of the year. The owners can improve the odds by scheduling maintenance shutdowns for periods of low demand in the hope that the reactor would be ready when the busy summer months came. Delays Are Common</p> <p>But unscheduled shutdowns, or delays in reopening, are common. Reactors in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Alabama have been shut for more than a year because of management problems. There is always the possibility of major equipment failures, and there is always the chance of an accident.</p> <p>In addition, even if Shoreham were to run, it would not quite add 800 megawatts - enough for hundreds of thousands of households - to Lilco&#39;s capacity to supply energy. Paradoxically, a large plant is not the best way to add capacity to a thinly stretched utility, engineers say, because to reduce the risk of blackout, the system must be run at all times on the theory that the largest source of power could be lost without warning.</p> <p>To do so, an amount of electric capacity proportional to the largest source must be held in reserve. That means having 800 megawatts of other generating capacity idle and standing by, or having extra capacity on the transmission lines.</p> <p>Currently, Lilco&#39;s largest sources are less than 400 megawatts, in its Northport generating station.</p> <p>When work on Shoreham started, that factor seemed less important. Lilco was considering a second reactor at Shoreham, and two more at Jamesport, which would have made Shoreham less of a big fish in a small pond.</p>
715752>ACCORD MAY GIVE NYNEX CUSTOMERS A BREAK ON RATES Nynex and the staff of the New York State Public Service Commission announced yesterday that they had struck a tentative deal for a new kind of regulation that would give customers a break on rates and remove almost all limits on how much the company could earn. The accord, if approved soon by the Public Service Commission itself, would make New York the first state in the nation to let long-distance carriers compete easily with local phone companies in handling medium-distance calls. Michigan plans to allow such competition beginning in 1996. In theory, this means that customers could end up dealing with three different phone companies: one for local calls, one for medium-range calls and one for long-distance calls.  <p>The agreement announced yesterday is part of an effort by New York State to deregulate the local telephone business. It would end traditional &quot;cost-based&quot; regulation, in which the commission sets a limit on profits and then sets rates that will produce those profits. Instead, prices for services will be regulated and the company will be free to make as much money as it can by selling more of those services more economically. About 28 states have taken steps toward such a system, called &quot;incentive regulation.&quot;</p> <p>If the plan is approved, Nynex would cut customers&#39; bills by a total of about $1 billion between 1995 and 1999, about 3 percent of its revenues. In 1996, rates would be 6 percent lower on average than they would have been.</p> <p>&quot;We&#39;re looking at this as a real win-win,&quot; said Richard A. Jalkut, president and chief executive of Nynex New York, the company&#39;s New York subsidiary, which serves 7.3 million customers with 10 million lines, or about 90 percent of the telephone market in the state.</p> <p>Many outsiders also praised the deal. &quot;These companies are all inefficient, and Nynex is probably the most inefficient,&quot; said Raymond E. Liguori, a telephone industry analyst at Salomon Brothers. Under traditional regulation, he said, a phone company has little incentive to cut costs because the savings go back to customers through reduced rates. &quot;Under price regulation, they&#39;ll get to keep some of it,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Nynex had 40,000 employees at the beginning of this year and reiterated yesterday that it planned to reduce its payroll by 13,000 by 1996.</p> <p>If the deal is approved, consumers would notice a difference beginning on Jan. 1, when the extra charge for touch-tone service at residential numbers, now 50 cents a month, would be dropped.</p> <p>The direction that prices would take in the absence of an agreement is not clear; some analysts think they would decline anyway because of competition or the threat of competition. Nynex has already lost its monopoly status in New York, with several other companies offering local telephone service, mainly to office buildings in Manhattan.</p> <p>And beginning next year customers could sign up with other phone companies for the medium-range calls -- like those between, say, New Rochelle, N.Y., and Manhattan -- just as they now sign up with a long distance company for calls between New Rochelle and New Orleans.</p> <p>But AT&amp;T, MCI and some others that might be expected to enter that market said quickly yesterday that they would oppose the deal.</p> <p>Those companies already do business with local phone companies on long-distance calls -- if the customer in New Rochelle calls Washington, D.C., the long-distance company would accept the call from Nynex and deliver it to the local company in Washington and pay a handling charge to each company. But the long-distance carriers are complaining that the handling charge Nynex wants for the medium-distance calls, which would be handled by Nynex at both ends, is so high that they could not compete with Nynex itself.</p> <p>&quot;The proposed plan,&quot; said Marc Rosen, an AT&amp;T vice president, in a statement, &quot;would effectively lock in Nynex&#39;s entrenched monopoly and lock out competitors at least until the end of the century.&quot;</p> <p>But another long-distance competitor that was a party to the negotiations, Sprint, supported the deal.</p> <p>Most rate cases in New York are settled through agreements among the regulated utility, consumer groups and other interested parties, and the commission staff; the commission itself then accepts the deal, rejects it or tinkers with the package and sends it back to the parties to accept or amend. The last two deals between the staff and Nynex were approved by the commission and the one before that was rejected.</p> <p>That is little guide to how the commission will act in this case because the issue is not really the rates but the means of regulation itself. Still, this agreement, which has been under negotiation among 40 parties for nearly two years, follows a direction sought by the commission, toward deregulation.</p> <p>The plan, intended as a bridge toward a period of even greater competition, includes several provisions designed to protect low-income consumers. It also allows for the commission to modify the arrangement if the company achieves what the staff termed &quot;exceptional&quot; profits.</p> <p>Wall Street evidently thought Nynex could make money under the proposed deal; the stock closed yesterday at $38, up $2, in heavy trading.</p> <p>The deal may have implications for the company in Washington since Nynex has applied to the Justice Department for permission to enter the long-distance market nationally. The company, analysts said, could argue that if AT&amp;T can compete in Nynex&#39;s backyard in handling calls between New Rochelle and Manhattan, then Nynex should be able to compete with AT&amp;T between New Rochelle and New Orleans.</p> <p>Separate from yesterday&#39;s agreement on Nynex&#39;s rates, the Public Service Commission is now hearing a case about establishing competition in telecommunications, cable television and information services, and experts said this accord would push the commission toward more competition in the second case.</p>
401726>Rise in Oil Production Fails to Blunt Price Increase Global oil production is running 200,000 barrels a day higher now than it was before the Kuwaiti crisis began, but even so, prices will not fall until there is an easing of tension in the Middle East, W. Henson Moore, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, said at the American Petoleum Institute&#39;s annual convention here this morning. When calm returns, he said, prices will drop to the low $20&#39;s, roughly what they were before Iraq&#39;s invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.  <p>Mr. Moore, the second-ranking official of the Department of Energy, also said Government and industry figures alike showed that domestic oil deliveries in October were down about 5 percent from October 1989. The reasons, experts say, are conservation induced by higher prices and an economic slowdown.</p> <p>Mr. Moore addressed the closing session of a convention that attracted 1,600 industry executives, many of them in an uncertain and defensive mood.  &#39;Witch Hunt Expected&#39;</p> <p>Allen E. Murray, the chairman of the institute and president and chief executive of the Mobil Corporation, cited attempts in Washington to begin a new &quot;witch hunt&quot; against the industry because of price increases. Speaking at the Chicago Hilton, he argued that the public should appreciate the industry. &quot;We helped Americans achieve a standard of living second to none,&quot; Mr. Murray said. &quot;We helped make America the major military and economic power in the world.&quot;</p> <p>But listing the moratoriums approved by Congress on coastal drilling and the refusal to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as well as the decision not to operate the Shoreham nuclear reactor in New York, he said, &quot;Our politicians, it seems, still pay more heed to the extremist Greens than to the Saddam Husseins of the world.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Moore said his department planned to send a list of policy options to the White House next month in an effort to reconsider those decisions.  Rise in Imports Seen</p> <p>Without a change in government policy, Mr. Moore said, oil imports, which now stand at about 50 percent of consumption, would rise to 80 percent by 2030. Oil&#39;s share of total energy used would decline from the current 40 percent to about 36 percent in the same period, he said.</p> <p>He added that the package of oil tax changes approved in the budget compromise would cost the Treasury about $2.5 billion over the next five years, while increasing domestic production about 175,000 barrels a day. By 2000, he said, tax breaks to encourage &quot;enhanced recovery&quot; of oil from fields from which no more can be extracted by standard pumping would produce and extra 320,000 extra barrels a day.</p> <p>Production was 7.2 million barrels a day in September, down about 3 percent from September 1989, and for all of 1990 the decline is likely to be steeper.</p> <p>Looking at Legislation</p> <p>Besides prices, one cause of concern to the executives here is the Clean Air Act. Mr. Murray, the Mobil chief, said: &quot;The environment cannot be preserved in a vacuum. It even takes energy to build and install pollution control devices, manufacture catalytic converters and refine reformulated gasoline.&quot;</p> <p>Experts here said the first data from a $16 million emission study by the three major domestic auto producers and the major oil companies would be available next month. The study is seeking to determine which combination of cars, fuel and additives produces the best results.</p> <p>Speaking of the new standards, Constantine S. Nicandros, the chairman of Conoco, a subsidiary of E. I. du Pont de Nemours, said, &quot;Nobody is quite sure what exactly we&#39;re going to have to meet.&quot;</p> <p>Separately, the institute released a study that said the price of gasoline in mid-October was about 60 cents a gallon lower than it was at its peak, 1981, when inflation is taken into account.</p>
557969>U.S. Aides Propose $500,000 Fine for State Power Authority Federal authorities yesterday proposed fining the New York State Power Authority $500,000, saying it had suffered &quot;a significant breakdown in management and administrative control&quot; at one of its nuclear reactors, the James A. Fitzpatrick plant in Scriba. The Power Authority said it had already addressed some of the deficiencies but had not decided whether to pay the fine, which is large by Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards. The Power Authority could appeal the fine to the commission.  <p>The commission staff said the Power Authority had submitted incomplete or inaccurate information about mishaps at the 17-year-old plant and had installed new electrical relays on the system that is supposed to shut down the reactor in an emergency without evaluating them properly or checking them after they were installed.</p> <p>In addition, the staff said, the Power Authority had failed to identify and correct serious problems. For example, a leak of thousands of gallons of water a day from the main steam system began in mid-August 1991 the staff said, and was not corrected until commission inspectors pointed it out in October. Letter Faults Management</p> <p>The Power Authority was also cited for failing to protect &quot;equipment that is essential to shutting down the reactor&quot; from fire and smoke damage.</p> <p>Fitzpatrick is on Lake Ontario, eight miles northeast of Oswego.</p> <p>In a letter to the authority, the regional administrator of the commission, Thomas T. Martin, said plant management had failed in areas that &quot;are fundamental elements of any program for operating and maintaining a nuclear power plant in a safe manner.&quot;</p> <p>The commission put the plant on a &quot;watch list&quot; of reactors needing increased attention in February of this year. Fitzpatrick has been closed since November 1991 for refueling, maintenance and fire protection work and is scheduled to return to service next month.</p> <p>In a statement, Ralph E. Beedle, the Power Authority&#39;s executive vice president for nuclear generation, said the issues raised by the commission &quot;all arose some time ago and we have since addressed all and resolved most of them.&quot;</p> <p>For example, he said, the authority has replaced all 208 of the suspect relays and &quot;implemented a comprehensive program to identify root causes of problems at the plant.&quot;</p> <p>Power Authority officials stressed that the proposed fine covers violations over a long period and that they have instituted a &quot;results improvement program&quot; to make the plant run better.</p>
314235>The Nation; The Nuclear Arms Business Is Stalled, Still and Again Yet another mighty artifact of the cold war is crumbling with startling speed: the complex of plants that makes America&#39;s nuclear bombs.  <p>This is not by design. Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, who inherited a manufacturing system with parts that date from the Manhattan Project in the 1940&#39;s, complained in a recent interview that &#39;&#39;there has been no modernization program at all for the entire complex, and you can&#39;t run a business like that.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>For now, the business is barely running, facing even longer delays than it was when Mr. Watkins took over nine months ago. That is partly because Mr. Watkins has been willing to stop operations for evaluation, management reorganization, worker training and physical improvements.</p> <p>Another reason is increased environmental concern. This began before Mr. Watkins, with the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union. The accident led to a re-evaluation of the plutonium-producing N Reactor in Hanford, Wash., whose design has some similarities to the Chernobyl reactor, and then to an unraveling that is still going on.</p> <p>In December 1986, the Energy Department announced a six-month shutdown of the reactor for modernization, and within months it was shut more or less permanently. That decision doomed a huge chemical processing plant at Hanford, which handled the used fuel, as well as plants that prepared the fuel.</p> <p>While the consensus now is that there is no need for more plutonium, the second principal component, tritium, is another problem: the inventory shrinks about 5.5 percent a year because of natural decay. But here, too, priorities seem to be changing. In October 1988, a Pentagon official said that the United States faced &#39;&#39;unilateral nuclear disarmament&#39;&#39; unless the three reactors at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, the only source of tritium, were started again in 1989. But it now appears that the first reactor will not start before next fall. Headed for Trouble</p> <p>Once highly secret and highly productive, the network of 17 plants has been headed for trouble since 1984, when a Federal judge in Tennessee ruled that the plants had to comply with Federal anti-pollution laws.</p> <p>Hectored by outside critics, the Energy Department this month agreed to perform environmental studies before restarting the Savannah River reactors. Earlier this year, the department promised to do the same at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California, where it wants to build a pilot plant for a laser system for refining plutonium. Meanwhile, the bulk of the complex is shut. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re mining a stack of material put on the shelf in years gone by,&#39;&#39; said Dan W. Reicher, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council. &#39;&#39;The question is, how long can that continue?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Watkins said conditions in the complex had improved to &#39;&#39;satisfactory&#39;&#39; from &#39;&#39;barely satisfactory.&#39;&#39; Next year will be &#39;&#39;good,&#39;&#39; he said. Over the longer term, he sees a new system, with at least one new tritium production reactor, modernized at a cost of tens of billions of dollars.</p> <p>Mr. Reicher said the closing of much of the complex has raised &#39;&#39;the fundamental question of how many more warheads we really need to be building, given the fact that we&#39;ve got around 24,000 already.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Other critics, too, say that the plan to produce more plutonium reflects cold war thinking. Even the National Academy of Sciences, in a report issued Dec. 21, said the nation&#39;s stockpile and ability to recycle plutonium from retired weapons &#39;&#39;are adequate to meet the demand for maintaining a stockpile similar to the current one.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Government&#39;s needs, and its logic, are not entirely clear. The amount of plutonium in its stockpile is classified, and the amount ordered each year, in a memorandum from the President, is classified as well.</p>
794944>Faucets That Pass the Lead Test HUNDREDS of faucet models sold at retail stores around the country will soon  carry a new symbol certifying that they meet a safety standard for lead, cadmium, mercury and other toxic substances. Faucets made by six manufacturers passed tests in which water was held in them for specified periods over the course of 19 days. Then the water was tested to determine whether it had picked up any of the substances, some of which are often used in making faucets themselves. The standard was developed jointly by the plumbing industry, public health officials and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The tests were  carried out by NSF International, formerly the National Sanitation Foundation, a standards setting group in Ann Arbor, Mich., whose logo will appear on the boxes of faucets that passed. Using an approved faucet will not guarantee that the water is safe to drink, only that the faucet itself did not contribute more of a contaminant than the standard allows. For lead, the  <p>The standard was developed jointly by the plumbing industry, public health officials and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The tests were  carried out by NSF International, formerly the National Sanitation Foundation, a standards setting group in Ann Arbor, Mich., whose logo will appear on the boxes of faucets that passed. Using an approved faucet will not guarantee that the water is safe to drink, only that the faucet itself did not contribute more of a contaminant than the standard allows. For lead, the faucet can contribute no more than 11 parts per billion. &quot;This is the first time that consumers can ever make an educated choice about a  faucet based on health effects, by looking for the NSF mark,&quot; said Dr. Ann Marie Gebhart, a vice president of NSF. Several faucets that failed the test are being redesigned by the manufacturers,  she said. Lead, the contaminant of most concern to experts, can depress intelligence, especially in children. It can also cause high blood pressure, kidney damage and infertility. Often, the amount of lead in the water depends on the chemistry of the water itself before it gets to the faucet: if the pH is low, the water tends to leach  lead out of pipes. The NSF tests were done with this chemically &quot;aggressive&quot; water. The acceptable levels also apply to refrigerator ice makers and kitchen instant-hot-water taps. The manufacturers are expected to start putting the NSF symbol on packaging within weeks. The manufacturers are the Haws Drinking Faucet Company of Berkeley, Calif.; Modern Faucet Manufacturing of Los Angeles; Moen Inc. of North Olmstead, Ohio; Neoperl Inc. of Waterbury, Conn., Price Pfister Inc. of Pacoima, Calif., and the Zin-Plas Corporation of Walker, Mich. The full list of approved faucet models is available by calling NSF at (800) 673-8010. Those with access to the Internet can find the list at http://www.nsf.com.</p>
1359061>FedEx Shipped a High Radiation Package Without Knowledge FedEx unwittingly carried a package from Paris to New Orleans last week that was emitting so much radiation that the recipient, a company that packages radiation sources for industrial testing, has been unable to get near enough to measure it directly. But FedEx officials said the fact that the container passed undetected through the company&#39;s system did not indicate a security risk, because the shipper and the recipient were known to FedEx, allowing easy approval of the shipment.  <p>If terrorists had tried to ship radioactive material they would have failed, the company said, because extra precautions would have been taken in the case of an unknown shipper or recipient.</p> <p>FedEx never monitored the radiation while the shipment was in its custody. The recipient, the Source Production and Equipment Company, notified FedEx of the radiation after a FedEx truck delivered the 300-pound package to the company&#39;s factory in St. Rose, La.</p> <p>The company told FedEx in an initial estimate that the dose at the surface was 10 rem per hour. If that is correct, a person exposed to the radiation would exceed the annual limit for exposure in half an hour, and within a few hours would show effects from radiation poisoning.</p> <p>At the Texas office of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Chuck Cain, the acting director of the materials branch, said that &#39;&#39;this event could have had very serious consequences.&#39;&#39;But Mr. Cain added that it did not appear that anyone had absorbed a large dose.</p> <p>The package contained Iridium-172, which is used for industrial radiography. The radioactive material is put behind a heavy piece of metal, and by measuring what comes through the other side, technicians can look for cracks or other flaws.</p> <p>The shipper was a Swedish manufacturer, Studsvik.</p> <p>Scott A. Mugnow, director of safety at FedEx, said the pilots on the plane that carried the shipment were  equipped with badges that measure radiation, and that when those were processed they did not show significant exposure. But other workers who handled the shipment did not have such badges. FedEx is trying to calculate their exposure. Mr. Mugnow would not describe how a package from an unknown shipper would have been treated differently.</p> <p>The president of the Source Production did not return phone calls over two days.</p>
430112>Ideas &amp; Trends; When the Government Runs Afoul of Its Own Regulators PROMISING to make a clean break with 40 years of pollution at its nuclear weapons plants, the Department of Energy has signed agreements with states and with other Federal agencies committing itself to abide by environmental laws and clean up the mess. Now the Energy Department has a new problem. In some cases it is violating not only the laws, but also the agreements. Environmentalists say a distressing pattern is emerging, casting doubt on how the aging complex of bomb production plants can ever be cleaned up.  <p>The most pressing case is at a 37-year-old uranium processing plant at Fernald, Ohio, 20 miles northwest of Cincinnati. In an almost unprecedented action against another Federal entity, the Environmental Protection Agency is trying to collect a fine of about $300,000 from the Energy Department. The fine is not for environmental crimes, which include releasing poisonous and radioactive wastes through faulty filters or unfiltered vents for years, and dumping liquid wastes into lagoons that leaked into local waterways. The fine is for failing to live up to a 1990 agreement with the E.P.A. on what studies the department would carry out and what remedial actions it would take.</p> <p>The fine is not much compared with a department budget of $17.7 billion this year, but the embarrassment level is high. &quot;It shows to us taxpayers that the agency that&#39;s being fined is not complying with the law, that they are outlaws and they should be watched,&quot; said Shira Flax, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club.</p> <p>While the department agreed less than a year ago that if would pay fines if it missed deadlines, it is now arguing that one Federal agency fining another makes no sense. On Friday -- the deadline for the department to pay up or appeal its case to the E.P.A. chief, William K. Reilly -- it was given a 10-day extension.</p> <p>Leo P. Duffy, the department&#39;s top official on environmental safety and health, said fines would be appropriate against a commercial operator that was gaining undue advantage in the business world by violating environmental rules. But he said fines were not helpful if they would reduce the amount of money available to his department for cleanup.</p> <p>Fernald is not the only problem. Two years ago the Energy Department agreed with the state of Washington and the E.P.A. on a schedule for stabilizing the most hazardous wastes, the highly radioactive liquids in tanks at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation near Richland. But last month the department unilaterally announced a delay of one to two years. The state&#39;s Governor, Booth Gardner, said he was &quot;astounded.&quot;  &#39;No Technical Tooth Fairy&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Duffy said that it had proved harder than expected to take samples from the tanks to determine what was in them, and it made little sense to build a treatment system before the engineers were certain of what they would be treating. &quot;There&#39;s no technical tooth fairy that&#39;s going to come along and solve these problems,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Last week, James D. Watkins, the Energy Secretary, told the House Appropriations Committee that without a supplemental appropriation, &quot;I won&#39;t be able to carry out my duties&quot; at the Rocky Flats plant, near Denver, where a cleanup agreement was signed with Colorado two years ago. But in other cases, say critics, the department is violating agreements because it failed to ask for enough money to get the job done. In the Fernald case, part of the fine is for failing to carry out diagnostic studies on pollution. Because the studies have not been done, the department does not even know what remedial action will be needed, and what to ask Congress for.</p> <p>&quot;This is the Federal system learning how to work,&quot; said Susan Wilshire, a policy analyst at JK Research Associates, of Hamilton, Mass., a Department of Energy subcontractor that is trying to develop a system to decide which plants to clean up first.</p> <p>The bomb makers, who for years plowed ahead and produced whatever weapons national security demanded, with scant attention to much of anything else, appear now to have taken the same can-do attitude toward cleaning up the mess they created. But they may lack the ability. The Office of Technology Assessment, in a report released last month, said &quot;progress in cleaning up the waste and contamination at the weapons complex is being hampered by a paucity of data and qualified personnel, inadequate efforts to assess possible off-site health impacts, lack of ready technical solutions, and public skepticism about government agency decisions.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Even the meaning of cleanup is not fully understood,&quot; the report said. Moving Slowly</p> <p>It has been a long, circular journey for the Energy Department and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission. First the bomb makers insisted that they were not subject to state regulation, or even the regulation of other Federal agencies. But the Federal courts ruled in the mid-1980&#39;s, in cases brought by environmentalists, that since Congress had not explicitly exempted the department, it was subject to Federal regulation.</p> <p>In 1985 Joseph Herrington, then Secretary of Energy, said that his department would obey the laws and would sign agreements with environmental regulators specifying schedules for coming into compliance, much as a private company would. But the department moved extremely slowly, maintaining that among other problems it could not make commitments that would require appropriations from Congress, because the appropriations might not be forthcoming.</p> <p>After a raid on the Rocky Flats plant in June 1989 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the E.P.A., Mr. Watkins, the current Energy Secretary, re-affirmed that the department would sign agreements.</p> <p>Now it has the agreements but acknowledges that it has terrific trouble doing the work. Mr. Duffy said, however, that since he began, in November 1989, the number of people at his department&#39;s headquarters working on environmental repair has risen to 250 from 39, and in the field, to 600 from zero. &quot;You have to maintain a positive mental attitude in this environment, or nothing will get done,&quot; he said.</p>
716549>Indian Point and the Bottom Line THE Indian Point 3 nuclear plant in Buchanan is either a dinosaur, unable to compete economically against younger technologies in a changing environment, or it is a valuable asset that is getting much-needed changes in management and worker training so it can resume saving money for its customers. The New York Power Authority, the country&#39;s largest state-owned utility, which owns the plant and takes the second view, squared off last week against critics of the plant -- proponents of the dinosaur theory -- in a legislative hearing here that is likely to be only the first of a series of debates that will take a 30-year dispute about nuclear power in Westchester into a new phase: economics.  <p>The discussions will boil down to a giant, complex game of &quot;what if.&quot;</p> <p>The factors involved are stunning in their variety. There is the cost of competing fuels, especially natural gas; the level of industrial demand for electricity, the success of future campaigns to increase energy efficiency and the life expectancies of other generating stations around the state, nuclear and non-nuclear.</p> <p>There is also the question of how much money can be safely cut from the plant&#39;s budget, and whether some unforeseen event, at Indian Point 2 or 3 or at any of 107 other reactors nationwide -- or several hundred around the world -- will create the need for changes at the plant.</p> <p>When it produces power at all -- which it has not done in 19 months because of safety problems and will not do before next spring at the earliest -- Indian Point 3&#39;s electricity costs more than power from the open market, about 4.4 cents a kilowatt-hour, opposed to about 3 cents for electricity available on an hour-by-hour basis through the power grid.</p> <p>At the heart of the problem is high operating costs and a statewide surplus of more than 4,000 megawatts. (The peak demand for power in the state is about 26,000 megawatts.) Not counted in that surplus is the cushion of 22 percent that the state&#39;s utilities like to have on hand in case of breakdown or maintenance shutdown.</p> <p>Opponents believe surplus opens up the best opportunity to close Indian Point 3 since the early 1980&#39;s, the years immediately after the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Pa., when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission insisted on better emergency plans, and the reactors at Indian Point, with nearly 300,000 people within 10 miles, had difficulty complying. The hearings in the 1980&#39;s on the adequacy of emergency plans for the site in Buchanan were the longest in the history of the commission.</p> <p>Now, some people want to try again.</p> <p>&quot;You&#39;d have to have a relatively significant savings to justify the public-health risk, and the data is, it&#39;s more expensive,&quot; said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Greenburgh and chairman of the State Assembly&#39;s Environmental Conservation Committee, who held a hearing on the plant&#39;s economics in Croton last week.</p> <p>Here, though, all estimates rely on &quot;what ifs.&quot; What, for example, would the surplus look like if every plant were subjected to a hardheaded cost analysis?</p> <p>S. David Freeman, the president of the Power Authority, testified that for now his agency &quot;could probably purchase power at a price lower than the total embedded capital and operating costs of Indian Point 3. However, if every plant that is high cost in the short-term wholesale market in New York State were shut down, we&#39;d be very short of power.&quot;</p> <p>And in that case, utilities would be forced to run their most expensive plants, the ones that burn the most expensive fuels or burn them the least efficiently, and the result would be higher costs. At that point, experts say, Indian Point 3&#39;s power might look cheap again.</p> <p>Another &quot;what if&quot; is what happens if the plant runs no better in future than it did in the past.</p> <p>&quot;Today the plant is uneconomic,&quot; Mr. Freeman said in an interview. &quot;It&#39;s had a bad run the last year and a half; it&#39;s dead in the water.&quot; But new management and new attitudes will make it run better, he said; besides, most of the work required for reopening the plant has already been done.</p> <p>If the plant is retired now, he said, it would be on the basis of imperfect information. &quot;I don&#39;t know the future, and I don&#39;t think anybody else does,&quot; he said. &quot;One can have lots of projections for future natural gas prices, and somebody in all of this world is going to be right, but if you look at the past, there haven&#39;t been many of them.&quot;</p> <p>On the other hand, Charles Komanoff, an energy analyst, said in testimony that if the plant is kept running, it would also be on the basis of uncertain assumptions.</p> <p>Mr. Freeman, who was instrumental in canceling several nuclear construction projects when he was the chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, said that he would not hesitate to pull the plug if it did not appear that the plant could run well. Before coming to the Power Authority in March, he was the general manager of the Sacramento, Calif., Municipal Utility District, an agency he joined shortly after voters there decided to shut their nuclear plant, Rancho Seco.</p> <p>The error there, Mr. Freeman said, was spending hundreds of millions of dollars to fix up the plant and then finding out that it still would not run reliably. But Indian Point 3 deserves another chance, he said, and some cost-saving measures have not been explored, like merging security forces and spare-parts inventories with Indian Point 2, Con Edison&#39;s reactor, which is adjacent. Some people want to close Indian Point 2 also, but it runs more reliably so its power is cheaper, and closing it would be more complicated because the state does not own it. Indian Point 1, also operated by Con Edison, ran from 1962 to 1974.</p> <p>Mr. Freeman did not offer a detailed analysis but said he would confer with Mr. Komanoff to see why their assessments differed. Despite the fact that the two appeared in conflict at the hearing last week, the two are longtime allies, proponents of investing in conservation.</p> <p>But another state official, Francis J. Murray Jr., the State Energy Commissioner, did present an analysis that favored the plant. He sketched out four possibilities, each with a different combination of retirement dates: nuclear plants 30 to 40 years old and fossil plants 45 to 60 years old. He also threw into the mix varying levels of demand-side management, meaning utility subsidies to customers to invest in motors, lamps, air-conditioners and other equipment that uses less electricity.</p> <p>Under certain assumptions, he demonstrated, retiring the plant now would mean requiring new generating capacity as early as 2003, which is so close in utility terms that a company that thought it would need a new generator then would be actively planning it now. With a different set of assumptions, no new capacity is needed before 2009.</p> <p>The electric system currently allows expensive plants to operate, a situation that economists describe as inefficient, because most customers are not free to shop for cheaper supplies elsewhere. The Power Authority&#39;s single largest customer, New York City and its various governmental agencies, would like to shop that way and anticipates that in a few years, with changing Federal and state laws, it will be able to, paying Con Edison to deliver the power over its lines.</p> <p>Already, the threat of a free market in electricity has helped prompt the Power Authority to offer the city a long-term contract, making the authority&#39;s pain over the reactor more acute. Thus Kent Miller, the city&#39;s director of energy policy, said the city did not care what happened to the reactor, because it expects a contract that will insulate it from the cost increases that come when the plant is shut.</p> <p>But if the market opens up to allow users to negotiate with producers without the utility as a middleman -- a practice known as retail wheeling -- selling expensive electricity from Indian Point could become even more difficult.</p> <p>Illustrating the degree to which the problems of energy are interconnected with other problems, Mr. Miller said, New York City would not favor closing the plant if the Power Authority planned to make up the lost production by burning more oil and natural gas at the Polletti generating station in Queens. That would add to the city&#39;s air pollution problems, he said.</p> <p>Looming over the plant is another possibility, that expenses will rise instead of fall. In Albany, the Department of Environmental Conservation is considering requiring power plants on the Hudson to build cooling towers so they can use their cooling water over and over, drawing only small amounts to make up for evaporation rather than running water through the cooling system only once, as they do now. The current system pulls small fish into the plant and kills them.</p> <p>The cost of a cooling tower has been variously estimated. Mr. Freeman said it might be $200 million, probably too much to justify continuing to operate the plant.</p>
318163>EXPERTS DIAGNOSE TELEPHONE &#39;CRASH&#39; Engineers at A.T.&amp;T. tentatively concluded last night that the telephone system crashed because of a fault in a new signaling system, a part of the telephone network that helps complete long-distance calls.  <p>The signaling system carries information like the telephone number of the caller and the number being called. It signals the switching system the way a conductor signals an orchestra, sending information that the audience does not hear. This information is called &#39;&#39;out-of-band signaling&#39;&#39; because it is not heard by the callers.</p> <p>Yesterday&#39;s problem apparently had its origin in an effort begun in 1988 to modernize the system. New software apparently had a bug, engineers said, and the comapny called in engineers from Bell Laboratories to create overriding software to get the system working again.</p> <p>Hopes for This Morning</p> <p>Yesterday, only about half the long-distance, international and toll-free 800 calls on the A.T.&amp;T. network were completed, said a spokesman, William S. Weiss. Engineers were hoping to have the system back together by this morning. If they do not, and the number of calls doubles, Mr. Weiss said they did not know if the number of completions would also double.</p> <p>The company pioneered out-of-band communications in 1976, Mr. Weiss said, and originally used a proprietary system to do it. The result, he said, was a sharp reduction in the time between dialing the phone and ringing at the other end: from as much as 20 seconds to as little as 4 to 6 seconds. The system also allowed such refinements as having the phone network check with a data base to verify telephone credit card numbers before a call was completed. That work was formerly done by an operator.</p> <p>Now, Mr. Weiss said, &#39;&#39;If you dial a long-distance number, the system looks at the number you&#39;ve dialed and flashes it across in thousandths of a second, to see if a path is available, and if the party you are calling is busy. Previously, the whole call had to be completed before you saw if the party was busy.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A Recent Revision</p> <p>The system was quickly followed by others, and the International Consultative Committee on Telephone and Telegraph, which is affiliated with the United Nations, stepped in to establish international standards, Mr. Weiss said.</p> <p>A.T.&amp;T. is now installing the most recent revision of that standard, he said, and has now made all 110 of its computerized telephone switches compatible with the new system.</p> <p>Mr. Weiss said the problem came when the company began converting its tens of thousands of trunk lines, which involved software and printed circuit boards in computer equipment.</p> <p>A.T.&amp;T. has had software problems that affected customer service, but not on this scale, he said. Asked if foreign telephone companies or competing American long-distance companies had had problems changing over to the new standard, he said, &#39;&#39;My guess is they&#39;ve had some troubles as well.&#39;&#39; But he said their problems might not be so obvious, because they are smaller. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re hanging out there for the world to see,&#39;&#39; he said.</p>
1546874>U.S. SCOURS FILES TO TRACE SOURCE OF MAD COW CASE Agriculture officials pored through cattle sales records at two Washington State companies on Wednesday in hope of finding where a cow with mad cow disease was born so they could trace the extent of the outbreak. Officials hope to be able to determine where, when and how the Holstein became infected with the disease as a clue to whether other animals were also infected. But they have faced slow going because of a lack of centralized records on the animal&#39;s history, officials said.  <p>Beef importers abroad were not waiting for the results. By early Wednesday, about two-thirds of the export market for beef had already dried up, with Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Russia and South Africa all banning imports of American beef, agriculture officials said. About 10 percent of American beef, worth about $2.6 billion a year, is exported.</p> <p>Reacting to the announcement about the infected cow made late Tuesday, traders on Wednesday beat down the price of beef futures on the commodity exchange by 1.5 cents a pound, the daily limit, and the stock of the McDonald&#39;s Corporation fell 5.2 percent, to $23.96 a share, the day&#39;s worst performance among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial average. Tyson Foods, the world&#39;s biggest meat processor, fell 7.7 percent, to $12.90 a share.</p> <p>Agriculture officials, meanwhile, repeated their assertions that meat from sick animals is not infectious -- only tissues in the nervous system -- and that those tissues are unlikely to enter the food supply of people or of animals susceptible to the disease. But they issued a &#39;&#39;voluntary recall&#39;&#39; for more than 10,000 pounds of beef.</p> <p>And in restaurants and supermarkets, people talked worriedly about beef that was in their freezers or that might hit supermarket shelves in weeks to come.</p> <p>The prevailing attitude among restaurateurs was wait-and-see. Still, some immediately adjusted their menus, removing items like braised beef cheeks and bone-marrow mashed potatoes, made from animal parts considered high risk. And fast-food chains issued statements assuring customers that they had put safeguards in place several years ago.</p> <p>The extent of the reaction from the public and the economic markets may depend on how widespread the outbreak is determined to be. But on Wednesday, the Agriculture Department could say only that it was on the trail. Officials said that the cow that was found to have mad cow disease probably contracted it from feed as a young animal, but officials do not know where it was born or where the other animals in that herd were now. It came through one of two livestock markets, and &#39;&#39;at least one of the livestock markets in question has very good records,&#39;&#39; said Dr. Ron DeHaven, chief veterinarian of the Department of Agriculture.</p> <p>But officials continued to say that public health is protected because the parts of the animal that can spread the disease are not normally used in food for humans.</p> <p>Those parts are not supposed to be used in food for cows, either, being diverted instead for food for poultry and house pets. Officials said only about 75 percent of processers complied with the rule when it took effect in 1997 but that figure has risen significantly since then. The Holstein appeared to be about four years old and was probably born in 1999, officials said.</p> <p>Critics have complained that progress toward compliance has been uneven.</p> <p>Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, an environmental and public health group, said that government reports in October 2003 and April 2002 showed that the number of violations had tripled.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It doesn&#39;t look like the word has gotten out,&#39;&#39; Mr. Blackwelder said. &#39;&#39;You have to wonder, why with the dramatic impacts to the Canadian beef industry, and seeing what it&#39;s done in Europe, why mess around and take any kind of risk?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Canada, which normally exports most of its beef, reported a single case in May, and its exports are still limited as a result. Mr. Blackwelder said that because the United States Agriculture Department could not say where the sick cow came from, &#39;&#39;the idea they&#39;ve got just one area that&#39;s a problem is not a credible scenario.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But Dr. Stephen Sundlof, director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the Food and Drug Administration, said that 1,826 companies handle the parts of cattle that can transmit the disease -- the brains, spinal cord and the upper part of small intestine -- and that only two are out of compliance.</p> <p>Dr. Linda Detwiler, a veterinarian who retired this year as head of the mad cow disease working group at the Agriculture Department, said the rules themselves were inadequate. For example, litter swept from poultry factory farms, consisting largely of food the birds have not eaten, can be fed to cows, but this might allow cow nerve tissue back into the cow food chain, she said.</p> <p>And, Dr. Detwiler said, the country needs a way to trace animals quickly. Private companies have proposed a variety of solutions; one, Digital Angel Corporation, of St. Paul Minn., sells microchips the size of a grain of rice that can record data and be implanted in an animal. In this country the main market is house pets, but the company has a variant that also measures body temperature, which it is marketing in England. The hope is to find a pattern of body temperature that is an early clue to the disease, formally bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Currently it can be identified only post mortem.</p> <p>Agriculture officials, meanwhile, continued to try to reassure the public. In a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, Ann M. Veneman, the secretary of agriculture, said that &#39;&#39;the risk to human health from this situation is extremely low, and people should continue to feel very confident in our meat supply.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Dr. DeHaven said the outstanding questions about the infected cow were: &#39;&#39;Where did this animal come from, where were the feed sources, where did animals move out of this herd?&#39;&#39; The animal was purchased by a farm near Yakima, Wash., in October 2001, shortly before having her first calf.</p> <p>Early Wednesday, his department issued a &#39;&#39;voluntary recall&#39;&#39; for 10,410 pounds of raw beef &#39;&#39;that may have been exposed to tissues containing the infectious agents,&#39;&#39; he said. That consisted of the carcass of the diseased cow and 19 others that were processed at the same time.</p> <p>Neurological samples were taken on the day the cow was taken from the herd and slaughtered, Dec. 9, and received at a government laboratory in Ames, Iowa, on Dec. 11, officials said. The samples were not prepared for analysis until Dec. 16 or 17. Dr. DeHaven said that the laboratory used a test that was &#39;&#39;the gold standard,&#39;&#39; called immunohistochemistry but that it takes five days, so the initial results were not available until the Dec. 22. When those came back positive, more tests were run, taking another day. Final tests in England will take another few days.</p> <p>In the last few years, Congress has come close to approving legislation to prohibit the slaughter for human consumption of &#39;&#39;downer&#39;&#39; cattle -- those that cannot walk. The inability to walk can be caused by many factors, but it is one symptom of mad cow disease.</p> <p>The measures have been vigorously opposed by the farm lobbies and have been blocked by leaders from both parties on the House Agriculture Committee.</p> <p>In 2001 and 2002, the legislation was passed by the House and Senate as part of a large farm bill, but the committee leaders saw to it that the provisions were not in the bill that came out of the conference committee. This year, the Senate favored a rider on the agriculture appropriations bill that would have prevented the slaughter of these cows. In July, the prohibition was rejected by the House, 202 to 199, and it is not part of the omnibus spending bill now before Congress.</p> <p>Representative Gary L. Ackerman, Democrat of Queens, the chief sponsor of the legislation in the House this year, argued in the debate that it would &#39;&#39;improve the safety of our food supply and prevent animals such as these from entering our food chain.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who heads the agriculture committee, argued that if it were against the law to slaughter downer cows for human consumption, animals sick with mad cow disease would never be spotted by veterinarians or food inspectors. The animals would be buried on the farms or &#39;&#39;perhaps even put into the food chain illegitimately, because the farmer has absolutely no incentive to do anything otherwise,&#39;&#39; Mr. Goodlatte said.</p> <p>Chandler Keys, Washington lobbyist for the National Cattlemen&#39;s Beef Association, said that decisions about &#39;&#39;downer&#39;&#39; animals were made by government veterinarians at the slaughterhouses, and that he would be open to changing the guidance given to them. But, he said, &#39;&#39;just putting out a government fiat about that, a poorly written law that says no to an animal that has a limp, that&#39;s not a risk-based system.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Keys also argued that the United States was not as vulnerable to problems like those in Europe, where bovine spongiform encephalopathy is believed to have caused scores of cases of a human form, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In Europe, he said, brain tissue was part of the normal cuisine. But, he said, &#39;&#39;People wouldn&#39;t take kindly to eating brain in their hamburger. It&#39;s just never been the practice here.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>MAD COW DISEASE IN THE UNITED STATES: THE OVERVIEW</p>
733004>Dec. 11-17; Rail Routes Written on the Wind Hiawatha will no longer roam the land, the Silver Meteor and Silver Star will grow rare, the Desert Wind will blow less often and the romance of the rails will diminish, as Amtrak shrinks itself drastically early next year to trim expenses to fit revenues. Cuts announced last week amount to more than 20 percent of the train miles, and concentrate heavily on long-distance routes. The Empire Builder -- perhaps the last non-pejorative use of the word empire -- will run between Chicago and Portland only four times a week in most of its route. The Hiawatha, 13 trips a day from Chicago to Milwaukee, will cease altogether. The Montrealer from Washington through New York to Montreal will end in New York.  <p>Many of the names were part of a marketing strategy meant to give riders &quot;a travel experience, to get in touch with the country,&quot; said Clifford Black, an Amtrak spokesman. Some names were inherited from railroads long forgotten; others Amtrak invented.</p> <p>Amtrak, created by Congress in 1971, is itself on the line, according to officials. Any further cuts and it will cease to be a national railroad system, only a few isolated corridors of heavy travel. MATTHEW L. WALD</p>
497822>Technology; Loping Toward the Death Star, With Every Sense but Smell FOR years, airlines and the military have used flight simulators to train pilots for equipment failure or bad weather. But lately, the still-evolving technology has been put to use to allow novices to accompany a fighter pilot on a strafing run over the Death Star or to ride a flying sports car down the throat of a tyrannosaurus rex. In some ways, this is easier to simulate than landing a 747 in a fog-bound airport. A real-life simulator, after all, must measure up to the operators&#39; previous experience. But the fantasy rides -- though called &quot;flight simulators&quot; by amusement park designers -- can take some poetic license.  <p>What the entertainment medium requires is a realistic feel, and in that area the new rides have surpassed the industrial simulators in some ways. There are magnificent visual displays, vast sound systems, motion platforms to give the sensation of flight, if not in the cerebral cortex, at least in the gut.</p> <p>The newest and biggest flight simulator is a $40 million &quot;Back to the Future&quot; ride at Universal Studios here. It uses the same cast of characters as the three &quot;Back to the Future&quot; movies and boasts that it plays to every sense except smell. Walt Disney World, nearby, runs two older models that are slightly less ambitious but still impressive: Star Tours, based on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie, and Body Wars, a simulated trip through the body on a tiny submarine-like vehicle.</p> <p>The function may be merely entertainment, but the technical effort is substantial, a level of information overload that approaches what computer designers call &quot;virtual reality,&quot; or stimulation of the entire sensorium with artificial input.</p> <p>Back to the Future, which opened in May, employs an Omnimax film projected on an 80-foot diameter screen shaped somewhat like the inside of an egg with an end cut off. The size and curve allows the horizontal axis to fill 270 degrees of the viewer&#39;s vision; in other words, not only the front, like a television set, but everything within easy sight even if the rider swivels his head.</p> <p>The difference between this image and the one on a TV screen is like the difference between listening to a symphony orchestra through the earplug of an AM radio and sitting in a concert hall.</p> <p>The negatives on the film itself are triple the size of the largest format now in use in movie theaters. Conventional movie film is measured in millimeters, for the width of each frame, and perforations, a count of the holes along the side of the frame by which the film is pulled along. The largest conventional film uses 70 millimeters and five perforations. But the Omnimax film is horizontal, 70 mm high and 15 perforations wide. The result is a negative with about 10 times as much information as a regular film negative, according to Douglas Trumbull, the director.</p> <p>That is a lot more information than comes across on many commercial simulators. Richard S. Bray, a recently retired developer of flight simulators at the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., said commercial airliner simulators show the pilot only what would be seen from the cockpit windshield and one side window.</p> <p>Simulators for fighter pilots sometimes show the entire sphere around the plane, he said, but because these are computer generated and the computer cannot create detailed images as fast as the pilot can move, they present limited information. &quot;Most of them are aimed at air-to-air combat, so they don&#39;t have to put much in-scene but the visible horizon, maybe some clouds and then the target aircraft,&quot; he said.</p> <p>One company, CAE Industries, of Toronto, uses eyepieces mounted on a helmet and changes the view as the wearer&#39;s head moves, he said. Others have tried showing great detail in the area immediately in front, and less in areas seen by peripheral vision, where detail is less detectable anyway.</p> <p>In those cases the simulator is interactive, meaning that it is the viewer, not the simulator, who decides which way the &quot;plane&quot; will fly and what will be seen next.</p> <p>But the Back to the Future ride makes up for the rider&#39;s passive role with vividness. The film, a $16 million effort, lasts only 4 minutes but the body says it is longer. Except for the last few seconds, when the time machine returns home with live actors and full-size props, it was shot entirely of miniatures, representing the mythical Hill Valley, Calif., in 2015 and in primordial times.</p> <p>AT the heart of the ride is the integration of sight with motion. Visitors sit in one of 12 mock-ups of an eight-passenger DeLorean sports car, with the trademark gull-wing doors but no roof. Each &quot;car&quot; sits on a motion platform.</p> <p>According to Terry Winnick, the producer of the ride, the platform can move as much as two feet forward or back, right or left, and can tilt front and back, left and right. It produces a force on the rider of up to 1.8 G&#39;s. (One G is the normal force of gravity. Producing a force of one additional G, or reducing the natural 1 G to zero, requires a change in speed of 32 feet per second, in a single second.)</p> <p>While 1.8 G&#39;s is not a challenge to an average person, it is a lot more than people encounter in everyday life. John K. Lauber, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal agency that investigates plane crashes, said that an airline passenger generally feels forces no greater than 1.5 G&#39;s.</p> <p>The motion platform does not really produce the sensations that the real maneuvers would, just as a real flight simulator, as Mr. Bray put it, &quot;is only able to present a pretty small part of the whole motion envelope the airplane&#39;s going through.&quot; But, he said, the motion &quot;supports the environment that&#39;s being described to you otherwise.&quot; By combining the suggestion of motion with the full visual impact, the ride induces the mind to accept that the rider is fully involved in the action.</p> <p>Integrating the platform with the movie is critical. Aviation experts say that movement perfectly handleable in a real vehicle can produce &quot;simulator sickness&quot; if the visual cue differs from the motion perceived by a rider&#39;s inner ear.</p> <p>The movie was shot with a computer-controlled camera, which moved the lens from point A to point B at a rate and along a trajectory set by human operators. That computer was then yoked to a control computer for the motion platform, said Mr. Winnick. The ride is essentially a chase scene, in which the visitor&#39;s DeLorean is careering through time and space in an attempt to overtake a DeLorean hijacked by the all-time miscreant, Biff Tannen, who threatens to run rampant and &quot;disrupt the space-time continuum,&quot; as an ever-breathless Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), tells visitors via videotape as they board. If the combination of sight and motion did not achieve the desired effect, then the scene was reshot or the motion platform recalibrated slightly, Mr. Winnick said.</p> <p>The ride begins and ends with a whiff of nitrogen gas, which creates a ghostly fog. During the ride, cold wind blows over the audience to simulate motion. A 10,000-watt multichannel stereo system helps too.</p> <p>Mr. Winnick said that the motion of the DeLoreans is adjusted slightly to account for individual angles of perspectives and that the combination of different motion and different perspective gives each visitor a slightly different ride.</p> <p>Disney would not discuss the technology behind its flight simulator rides, the first of which opened in January 1990. They are larger compartments, also on motion platforms, facing a smaller screen.</p> <p>BUT a spokesman for Disney World, John Dreyer, said that rides that move people in dramatic ways, as opposed to simply showing them things, are definitely at the cutting edge. Disney is building a &quot;Twilight Zone Tower of Terror&quot; in which visitors will descend 13 stories in free fall, he said.</p> <p>Eventually, with faster and cheaper computers, amusement-park rides could become interactive, but Mr. Winnick said that on his ride, a passenger would have trouble holding onto a joystick. Instead, he said, Back to the Future offers &quot;an artificial reality, a very personal reality.&quot;</p>
832573>U.S. Orders Passenger Trains to Slow Down After Some Stations After 14 deaths in commuter train wrecks in the last 14 days, the Transportation Department today issued emergency procedures intended to reduce the speed of the trains after they leave stations where there are no signals.. The department also issued rules governing equipment that will affect every rail passenger operation in the country, including Amtrak. In addition, changes  in procedures will apply to parts of 12 commuter systems, including small parts  of the Long Island Rail Road, the Metro North Railroad and a large part of New Jersey Transit.  <p>The changes were announced by Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena at an unusual White House briefing in the aftermath of a train crash last Friday in Silver Spring, Md., in which 11 people were killed, and another crash, in Jersey City on Feb. 6, in which two crewmen and a passenger died.</p> <p>The rail systems most affected are those like the Jersey City line that do not have automatic train controls or cab signals, which at least sound an alarm  in the cab if the engineer passes a red signal or goes too fast past a yellow signal.</p> <p>Under the new rules, if a train passes a signal and then stops at a station or anywhere else, it must proceed to the next signal as if the last one was yellow, generally at a speed of 30 miles per hour.</p> <p>Many rail systems already have such a rule, but on Friday a Maryland Rail Commuter Service train passed a signal in Kensington, Md., stopped at a station  there, and then accelerated to 63 m.p.h. before the engineer saw an Amtrak train crossing in front of him. The commuter train hit the Amtrak train, which was traveling from Washington to Chicago, at 40 m.p.h.</p> <p>The Kensington signal should have been yellow, but the engineer proceeded as  if it was green. Investigators have not yet determined what color it actually showed and say it is possible the engineer forgot by the time he left the station. Under the new rules, that would be irrelevant.</p> <p>&quot;Think of it as traveling on a yellow light every time you leave a station,&quot;  Mr. Pena said.</p> <p>The Secretary noted that the new rule might cause delays but added that railroads could install additional signals after station stops to ease the problem.</p> <p>The train in which 11 died in the Silver Spring crash was equipped for automatic train control, which would have prevented it from going too fast on that stretch, but the track itself did not have such equipment. The system was removed about 20 years ago, according to the Federal Railroad Administration.</p> <p>The railroad that then operated on that stretch, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, &quot;had taken off a lot of the high-speed trains, and they felt it was expensive to maintain,&quot; said Mortimer L. Downey, the Deputy Secretary of Transportation.</p> <p>In a second change announced today, each time engineers see a restrictive signal, red or yellow, they will be required to announce that fact aloud. On freight trains they will be speaking to each other and, over a radio, and possibly to other crew members. On trains like the ones in Silver Spring and Jersey City, they will be speaking to conductors who are punching tickets or carrying out other duties.</p> <p>&quot;This will add an element beyond the solitary visual acknowledgment of the engineer,&quot; said Donald M. Itzkoff, the deputy administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, the agency that issued the emergency rules.</p> <p>All railroads will also have to make sure that emergency window exits work and are clearly labeled. Four are required in each car.</p> <p>In the Silver Spring crash, survivors said they had to escape through a crack that opened in the wall and floor of the train itself because the doors and windows would not open. Emergency workers said they could not get into the train, and the National Transportation Safety Board said eight of the victims died from fire -- not from the impact of the crash -- when they could not escape from the burning wreckage.</p> <p>The cars involved, though, were new, as commuter rail cars go, and met all Federal safety standards, according to the manufacturer, Sumitomo of America Inc. A spokeswoman for the company, Jewelle Yamada, said today that there were two sets of doors on each side of the car, and each had a safety latch, marked &quot;emergency handle,&quot; on the exterior of the car.</p> <p>The Federal Government also said today that each rail passenger system would  have to submit a safety plan within 45 days, covering a variety of issues, including &quot;push mode&quot; operations like the ones in Silver Spring and Jersey City. In both cases, the commuter trains involved led with their chins, so to speak; the Maryland train and one of the Jersey City trains were running with the engines behind them, and the engineer in front, in a small cab in the passenger  car. That arrangement saves having to turn the train around in terminals, but there are no crash-worthiness standards for cars -- they do not perform well when they hit locomotives.</p> <p>But Mr. Pena stopped short of saying the Government would ban such operations.</p> <p>The Transportation Department is discussing crash standards with railroad officials but does not expect to have a preliminary rule to publish until next year.</p>
542246>COMPANY NEWS; Electric utilities are turning up the heat in search of a better refrigerator by offering a $30 million reward to the first company to build it. A group of utilities that serve one-fifth of the households in the United States, including Long Island and nearly all of New Jersey, announced the prize yesterday. The money would go to the developer of a refrigerator that would use 25 percent to 50 percent less electricity and no ozone-eating chlorofluorocarbons.  <p>The utilities, often at the urging of government regulators, have been encouraging increased efficiency in electricity use, as a cheaper way to balance supply with demand. The alternative is building new power plants and adding to pollution. A &#39;Golden Carrot&#39;</p> <p>The prize, which the utilities are calling a &quot;golden carrot,&quot; represents a new approach -- one that rewards manufacturers rather than consumers. For the last few years several utilities have paid subsidies to consumers to stimulate sales of more efficient refrigerators, or even quietly offered &quot;incentives&quot; to appliance store sales personnel to steer shoppers toward the more efficient models.</p> <p>In offering the prize, &quot;we&#39;re buying the production and delivery of super-efficient refrigerators into the service territories of the participating utilities,&quot; said Gary B. Fernstrom, the supervisor of residential program development at the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the chief financial officer of the utility consortium formed to administer the prize.</p> <p>The 23 utilities, scattered across the United States but with strong representation in the Northeast and on the Pacific Coast, serve a total of about 20 million of the nation&#39;s 94 million households. More companies may join, swelling the $30 million jackpot.  Bids Are Sought</p> <p>The group asked for bids from manufacturers, due in October, and promised to pick two semifinalists in December who would build prototypes by next June. The winner would be paid the $30 million as the refrigerators were delivered to appliance dealers. Each manufacturer&#39;s initial bid is to specify the number of refrigerators the company promises to produce.</p> <p>Members of the consortium met yesterday in Chicago with representatives of refrigerator manufacturers.  As a result, manufacturing executives most directly involved were out of their offices and unavailable for comment. Others said it was too soon to talk about whether the unusual structure, a winner-take-all prize, was a cost-effective way to improve the average efficiency of refrigerators.</p> <p>But one expert, a senior engineering executive at a major manufacturer, said that the plan could place the losers at a severe disadvantage. The engineer, who refused to be named for fear of offending the utilities and hurting his company&#39;s chance at the prize, said: &quot;The research and development by one company is going to be funded by the utility companies. The rest of the industry will have to duplicate the product at some period in time, and everybody else is going to have to absorb those costs internally.&quot; The Kilowatt-Hour Goal</p> <p>Refrigerators and freezers use about 20 percent of the nation&#39;s electricity, and vary widely in efficiency. A typical 18-cubic-foot model delivered to a kitchen 20 years ago and still in use will consume 1,500 to 1,800 kilowatt-hours a year, while the average model on the today&#39;s showroom floor uses about 900 kilowatt-hours, according to Mr. Fernstrom. His goal is a refrigerator that will use only 400 to 500 kilowatt-hours annually.</p> <p>If a customer replaced an 1,800-kilowatt-hour model with a 500-kilowatt-hour model, the utility could avoid burning two and a half barrels of oil a year, or 1,200 pounds of coal or 13,000 cubic feet of natural gas, and it would not need the power-plant capacity to burn them.</p> <p>COMPANY NEWS</p>
287561>Hydrogen Pushed as Motor Fuel Recent advances in the efficiency of cells that convert solar energy to electricity are increasing the possibility of using hydrogen as a practical, low-polluting motor vehicle fuel, according to a new study by two Princeton University physicists that was released here today.  <p>Hydrogen has been considered as an alternative fuel for some time. It is easily obtained by using electricity to break up water molecules, which are composed of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen. When hydrogen is burned as a motor fuel, the only emission is water vapor and a small amount of nitrogen oxides.</p> <p>But the amount of energy needed to produce hydrogen is greater than that created when it is burned, so its use as a fuel has been unattractive from a commercial standpoint. That could change, according to the report, because rapid advances in the technology of making electricity from sunlight could make power inexpensive enough by the end of the century to produce hydrogen more cheaply. More Attractive Alternative</p> <p>This would make hydrogen a more attractive alternative to other less-polluting fuels now being considered, like ethanol made from corn or gasoline made from coal, the study said. The anticipated price, about $2 a gallon, would probably still be higher than gasoline made from oil, but advocates said today that the environmental benefits might justify the extra expense.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;None of the other alternative fuels we are considering in the Clean Air Act even comes close to hydrogen,&#39;&#39; said James Gustave Speth, president of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental group that sponsored the study.</p> <p>Federal efforts are under way to toughen the standards for clean air, including the requirement that vehicle fuels be less polluting. The move recently prompted two oil companies, the Atlantic Richfield Company and the Sun Oil Company, to introduce reformulated gasolines that they said were cleaner-burning.</p> <p>Mr. Speth spoke at a news conference on the grounds of the Capitol, where the Solarex Corporation, a subsidiary of the Amoco Corporation that is the largest American-owned manufacturer of photovoltaic cells, displayed several models.</p> <p>Also on display was a Mercedes-Benz sedan with a hydrogen-powered engine. The car&#39;s design illustrated some of the disadvantages still to be overcome by hydrogen fuel: It contained a larger fuel tank than regular gasoline-powered cars because hydrogen contains only one-sixth the energy of gasoline. Even with the large tank, the car&#39;s crusing range is only 70 miles between refills. Cost of Equipment Saved</p> <p>Joan M. Ogden, one of the authors of the study, predicted that such fuel systems for hydrogen-powered vehicles would cost about $1,000 each. But since they would not produce the emissions of gasoline, like hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide or sulfur dioxide, she said, the cost of catalytic converters and other pollution-control devices currently on new cars would be saved.</p> <p>According to the study, solar energy could meet most of the nation&#39;s energy needs if it were used to produce hydrogen during sunny periods that could be burned as fuel when it was dark. The idea is not new, but has always been rejected as impractical because of the high cost of making electricity from sunlight.</p> <p>But researchers say that cost is soon likely to be low enough to allow hydrogen to be made in the deserts of the Southwest, and then transmitted to population centers by pipeline.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If you don&#39;t go to hydrogen,&#39;&#39; said one of the Princeton researchers, Dr. Robert H. Williams, &#39;&#39;then you&#39;re restricting photovoltaics to sunny areas.&#39;&#39; Converting the sun&#39;s energy to a fluid that can be shipped by pipeline, he pointed out, would make it possible to employ solar power anywhere.</p> <p>The system laid out by Dr. Williams and Dr. Ogden does not require any new inventions. Solar cells are already in use in pocket calculators and battery rechargers, and recovering hydrogen from water is an experiment commonly performed in high school chemistry labs.</p> <p>But it does require another sharp drop in the price of photovoltaic cells. They now cost between $4 and $5 per watt of capacity, and could fall to 20 to 40 cents by the turn of the century, the study said. While the drop seems steep, Dr. David Carlson, vice president and general manager of Solarex, pointed out that in the late 1970&#39;s, a square foot of cells cost about $1,000 and yielded 5 to 6 watts; now it costs about $50 and provides 13 watts.</p>
1367657>Seeking Damages From Iran, Ex-Marine Must Battle Bush Administration, Too Watching the destruction of the World Trade Center, recalling the bombing of the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut in 1983, the kidnapping and execution there of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins of the Marines in 1988 and other terrorist assaults, Rodney V. Sickmann has been rethinking his role in one of the first acts by Islamic extremists against the United States, on Nov. 4, 1979, when he was a Marine guard at the United States Embassy in Tehran. On orders from his superiors, Sergeant Sickmann did not so much as lob a tear gas grenade at the mob coming to occupy the embassy. Now he thinks he and his fellow guards should have started shooting.  <p>&#39;&#39;Had we opened fire on them, maybe we would only have lasted an hour,&#39;&#39; he said. But if he and 51 others had died there, rather than becoming hostages for the next 444 days, &#39;&#39;we could have changed history,&#39;&#39; he said, by sending the message that Americans could not be attacked without cost. Instead, he said, the surrender sent the message that there was no penalty for attacking the United States.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If you look back, it started in 1979; it&#39;s just escalated,&#39;&#39; he said in an interview at his home here.</p> <p>The national rediscovery of Islamic terror on Sept. 11 has made this a difficult time for Mr. Sickmann, known as Rocky. The mood was very different when he came home in January 1981.</p> <p>Then, there was an invitation to the White House, a parade in New York and a profusion of yellow ribbons. The plane that brought him back to St. Louis even had a yellow ribbon painted around its fuselage.</p> <p>Now, while the former hostages may be heroes in the history books and to people they meet, to the Bush administration they are a legal problem. It is painful, Mr. Sickmann said, that the State Department is blocking their effort to collect damages from the Iranian government.</p> <p>The administration&#39;s position perplexes him, given that Iran has been cited as a source of terror and that President Bush, in his State of the Union address, linked it with Iraq and North Korea in an &#39;&#39;axis of evil.&#39;&#39; The State Department argues that a class-action suit filed by former hostages would violate the accord that freed Mr. Sickmann and the others.</p> <p>The suit, filed in 2000 in Federal District Court in Washington, seeks damages from the Islamic Republic of Iran, an option opened by the Antiterrorism Act of 1996. Congress made that law retroactive to Nov. 1, 1979 -- three days before the embassy was stormed.</p> <p>For Mr. Sickmann, who has spent almost 20 years working for Anheuser-Busch, the suit reopened a part of his life that was never far from the surface. In testimony, he recalled how his captors had made him watch videos of Iranian political prisoners, convicted by revolutionary courts, stripped naked and shot. Later, he and his fellow hostages were stripped and guns were put to their necks.</p> <p>While in captivity he wrote in his diary, later published as a book, that he was glad the marines had held their fire and thus preserved the possibility of getting home. After returning, he married the girl he had left back home, Jill Ditch, and they  had three children. He now has a successful career training salespeople for Anheuser-Busch, a comfortable new suburban house and three minivans. There is still occasional adulation, such as he got from a store clerk a few weeks ago.</p> <p>He was helping his father, Virgil, and his mother, Toni, buy a washing machine. The clerk, a woman in her 20&#39;s, looked at Virgil&#39;s identification and asked if he was related to the hostage held 20 years ago.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Yes,&#39;&#39; Virgil said. &#39;&#39;He&#39;s right over there.&#39;&#39; Other family members say Rocky blushed.</p> <p>Mr. Sickmann&#39;s middle child, Chelsea, is in the eighth grade. &#39;&#39;You&#39;re coming up in our history book, Dad,&#39;&#39; she told him, casually.</p> <p>In his office at home, with computer and fax machine, are photos of the Air Force Boeing 707 that brought the hostages home from Germany, his honorable discharge from the Marines, and citations from the New York City Council and the Missouri House of Representatives. His children call this &#39;&#39;the hostage room.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Having been a hostage does not define Mr. Sickmann, 41, but it is part of him. His e-mail address begins SgtRock444. &#39;&#39;I wonder where that number came from,&#39;&#39; he said with a smile. Days ago, he said, he was having a bad day, the kind that makes you pound the steering wheel in frustration on the way to lunch. Then the cash register at Taco Bell rang up $4.44, and he flashed back.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You&#39;re right, God,&#39;&#39; he said he thought. &#39;&#39;This is not the worst thing that can happen.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But life lately has been confusing, he says, especially as he sees American resolve strengthen to fight terrorism while the government is blocking the hostages from holding Iran accountable for their captivity.</p> <p>The hostages are seeking $8 billion in Iranian assets in this country, deposits that date from the era of the shah, who was deposed by the leadership that held the hostages. Frederick L. Jones, a spokesman for the State Department, said that the president&#39;s identification of Iran as evil did not change the legal problem.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;To obtain the hostages&#39; release, the United States agreed in the Algiers accord to bar the prosecution of any pending or future claims against the government of Iran by the hostages,&#39;&#39; Mr. Jones said.</p> <p>The hostages won their suit by default in August, because the Iranians did not appear to defend themselves. But by December, when Judge Emmet G. Sullivan was preparing to fix damages, the Bush administration was tentatively courting support from Iran against the Taliban, and the Justice Department tried to block damages.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Here we try to get them to face up to the fact that they did something wrong, and who shows up in court? Our government,&#39;&#39; Mr. Sickmann said.</p> <p>Congress voted twice late last year to allow the hostages to collect.</p> <p>Administration officials say they are acting to preserve the credibility of the United States in international agreements. Mr. Sickmann has a blunter theory: that justice for the hostages has run afoul of foreign policy maneuverings. Despite Mr. Bush&#39;s language, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has suggested that a dialogue with some elements in Iran is still possible.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If we are in bed with Iran now, who are we going to be in bed with 20 years from now?&#39;&#39; Mr. Sickmann asked. Maybe the Taliban, he speculated. The enemy today has something in common with the people who seized him in 1979, he said: the Taliban, like the Iranian hostage takers, at first described themselves as students, and the methods they used to humble the United States were inexpensive and mostly low-tech.</p> <p>If the hostages prevail against Iran, it will be &#39;&#39;the only slap on the wrist they&#39;ll ever get for what they did 20 years ago,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Judge Sullivan may decide on Feb. 20 whether to award damages.</p> <p>A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FORMER HOSTAGE</p>
1754514>A Lagging Effort to Revamp Air Traffic Control Causes Delays A vast program to replace the voice and data lines that link the Federal Aviation Administration&#39;s air traffic control system has caused at least three major failures in the system recently, resulting in the grounding of scores of airliners, government officials say. And the program is so far behind schedule that the savings it was supposed to achieve are disappearing, the officials say.  <p>The contract to replace the system was awarded in 2002 to the Harris Corporation, and more of it was supposed to be completed by now, but the schedule was redrawn in December.</p> <p>Marion C. Blakey, the administrator of the F.A.A., acknowledged in a recent interview that it would still be &#39;&#39;a climb&#39;&#39; to stick to the revised schedule, which calls for completion in December 2007. Government officials have already identified $130 million in lost savings, and the figure appears rather likely to increase to $200 million. The F.A.A. has extended the program to 15 years from 10 years to try to recover some of the savings.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The projected savings are diminishing as we speak,&#39;&#39; Todd J. Zinser, the acting inspector general of the Transportation Department, of which the F.A.A. is a part, said at a hearing last month.</p> <p>One reason is that the agency is paying for costly older systems for longer than originally planned. Mr. Zinser said the new system, called the F.A.A. Telecommunications Infrastructure, was &#39;&#39;a high-risk program,&#39;&#39; and was unlikely to be done by the end of 2007.</p> <p>Al Dukes, president of the Harris Corporation&#39;s civil programs business unit, said the company spent the first two years testing equipment and developing a network operations center. Mr. Dukes said the company had turned only later to installing the new lines, which will connect about 4,400 sites, including radar systems and radios on remote mountainsides. He conceded, however, that to make the December 2007 goal, the company would have to install new lines on a schedule faster than the current contractor, Verizon, was required to disconnect the old ones.</p> <p>But, Mr. Dukes said, &#39;&#39;It&#39;s nothing challenging the laws of physics. It&#39;s strictly a contractual argument that the incumbent would have with the F.A.A.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In fact, Verizon is complaining that the transition has sharply increased its workload. After Verizon lost the bid for the new system, it was supposed to stay on until 2006 to provide service during the transition but now anticipates doing so until at least 2008.</p> <p>Technicians prepare to install parts of the new system, said Jerry Edgerton, president of the federal services group at Verizon, and &#39;&#39;the next thing you know, we get trouble reports because somebody has disconnected something that they had no authority to do.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s a discoordinated process,&#39;&#39; Mr. Edgerton said in an interview on Friday. He said that in the last few days, his company had been told to disconnect more than a dozen lines in Florida and then &#39;&#39;in total panic mode, they sent us reconnect orders.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Dukes said his technicians received monthly briefings on the importance of not tampering with live equipment, but he said, &#39;&#39;I can&#39;t guarantee when you have 100 human beings out doing things that they won&#39;t stub their toe and fall into something. But we have procedures, and we&#39;re very very attuned to the need.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>He said his company was installing new equipment at a rate that was within 5 percent of the schedule laid out in December.</p> <p>Mr. Edgerton&#39;s appraisal of the situation was different.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I have not seen any indications of a successful process that would lead me to believe that,&#39;&#39; he said, adding that Verizon was still providing &#39;&#39;90 to 95 percent&#39;&#39; of the service.</p> <p>The failures have come for various reasons. On March 6, the system lost contact with a radar near Chicago, leading controllers to hold scores of planes on the ground. A new line had failed and the old one had been prematurely disconnected by the F.A.A., the agency acknowledged.</p> <p>Unions representing air traffic controllers and maintenance technicians have identified what they say are additional failures caused by the new system, but the agency has not confirmed those.</p> <p>The rising costs come as the agency tries to balance its books. Its revenue comes largely from the Aviation Trust Fund, and the fund&#39;s income is down because ticket prices are down and, in turn, a tax on airline tickets is bringing in far less money than the agency had anticipated.</p> <p>Partly as a result of the decline, the agency has recently dropped several modernization programs. Last week it declared negotiations with the controllers union at an impasse, and said it could not afford a new contract unless the controllers agreed to reductions in compensation because it needed the money for new hardware.</p>
739812>With Few Clues, Hearing Will Open on USAir Crash Near Pittsburgh That Killed 132 Four months after USAir Flight 427 rolled abruptly to the left and plunged to the ground at 300 miles an hour, killing all 132 people on board, the National Transportation Safety Board will open hearings in Pittsburgh today with a disturbing lack of clues and no working hypothesis about what caused the crash. By the time the safety board gets to the hearing stage, said a spokesman, Mike Benson, &quot;you usually have some better indications than what you have here.&quot;  <p>In this case, Mr. Benson said, &quot;We&#39;re going to have to piece this together, and it will take much more extensive work on our part.&quot;</p> <p>About 30 witnesses are expected to testify over four or five days on a variety of subjects, including the possibility that a rudder control unit could have malfunctioned and caused the accident. The device helps keep the nose of the plane pointed forward.</p> <p>Witnesses will also give information about pilot training, maintenance and other factors that could have contributed to the crash of the USAir jetliner, a 7-year-old Boeing 737, last Sept. 8 on an early evening flight from Chicago.</p> <p>&quot;We are confident we&#39;re going to be able to find a probable cause,&quot; Mr. Benson said. It is possible, he said, that the record will point to some conclusion that is not now evident.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, Bob Flocke, said: &quot;We&#39;re going into this without even a single viable theory. For every theory they&#39;ve got, they&#39;ve got physical evidence or aerodynamic theory that it didn&#39;t happen that way.&quot;</p> <p>The N.T.S.B. has failed to establish a probable cause in only four major crashes in its 28-year history. The most recent was the crash of another Boeing 737, belonging to United Airlines, in Colorado Springs on March 3, 1991.</p> <p>&quot;There are a lot of comparisons being made between the two accidents, mainly because there&#39;s not a lot to explain either one of them,&quot; said a USAir spokesman, Paul Turk.</p> <p>Some people are offering theories, though. A retired Trans World Airline pilot, H. G. Gibson, said the failure that made the USAir flight go out of control may have been related to the one that struck his jet, a Boeing 727 that suddenly rolled right and fell 35,000 feet in less than a minute, in April 1979 near Saginaw, Mich. He is petitioning the safety board for a hearing in that case.</p> <p>The USAir plane crashed in Aliquippa, Pa., as it was approaching Greater Pittsburgh International Airport in clear weather at about 7 P.M. It took only about 25 seconds to roll to the left and crash.</p> <p>One person who listened to the cockpit voice recorder said that in that brief period, someone says, &quot;Wow,&quot; and then the captain can be heard three or four times telling the first officer, &quot;Hang on there, hang on.&quot;</p> <p>The hearings are of special interest because the crash was USAir&#39;s fifth in five years. They are also of intense interest in Pittsburgh, where the airline is a mainstay of the local economy and where there had been no major crashes since 1958.</p> <p>Boeing, which built the plane, will send witnesses and a videotape explaining the control system. Other witnesses will come from the Federal Aviation Administration, USAir, the pilots&#39; union, and component manufacturers.</p> <p>The USAir spokesman, Mr. Turk, said the purpose of much of the testimony will be to rule out certain causes. For example, a witness from the F.B.I. will testify that there was no evidence of a bomb.</p> <p>But much attention will also focus on the system for controlling the rudder, which on the 737 is a single vertical surface above the tail. Last year the F.A.A. issued a directive saying that the power control units for the rudders of all 737&#39;s should be replaced by 1999, but Mr. Turk said the unit on the plane that crashed had not been replaced. Even now, he said, only about one-third of the units on USAir&#39;s planes have been switched.</p> <p>&quot;A major issue is the availability of parts,&quot; Mr. Turk said.</p> <p>The F.A.A. ordered the power control units replaced because hydraulic fluid leaks could make the rudder hard to operate or even make it move in the opposite direction from the one the pilot wanted. But the F.A.A. said in its order that the flaw was not known to have caused any in-flight problems in 737&#39;s.</p> <p>In early 1992, the F.A.A. considered ordering the inspection of another part of the power control unit, but decided about a year later that the inspection was unnecessary.</p> <p>Still, there is anecdotal evidence among pilots that the rudders can act erratically. The Seattle Times reported this month that it had analyzed reports submitted to the F.A.A., which it said the agency had not analyzed, and found 21 power control unit failures reported by United States airlines from 1974 to 1994.</p> <p>It also found 22 failures of the rudder control unit, a yaw damper. A yaw is a move of the nose to the left or right that differs from the direction of the plane&#39;s course; the damper, using gyroscopes to sense sudden changes of direction, sends commands to the rudder faster than a human pilot could, to keep the plane pointed straight.</p> <p>In the case of the T.W.A. incident in 1979, Mr. Gibson and his co-pilot recovered in part by lowering the landing gear to change the aerodynamics. The plane was moving so fast that all of the landing gear doors were later found to have been damaged by over-stress in the maneuver.</p> <p>The safety board attributed the incident to pilot error, but Mr. Gibson said the loss of control was consistent with failure of the rudder. He said the 727 and the 737 use some of the same components in the rudder.</p>
235507>E.P.A. Backing States on Gasoline Vapor The Environmental Protection Agency yesterday moved further toward allowing Northeastern states to cut air pollution by imposing stricter standards than the Federal Government does on the formulation of gasoline.  <p>The seven states moved earlier this year to require that in the warm months, refiners change the way that gasoline is made so that it is less apt to turn to a vapor. Fumes from evaporating gasoline, combined with other pollutants, cook in the sun on hot summer days and produce ozone.</p> <p>The E.P.A. said it would soon propose that two of the states, New York and New Jersey, be allowed to make the change. The others are Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine. New Hampshire is considering such rules, but would be carried along whether or not it imposed them because of gasoline distribution patterns, experts said. No Federal Regulation</p> <p>The states were free to act until earlier this month, because there was no Federal regulation on the tendency of gasoline to evaporate, which is measured by a parameter called the Reid Vapor Pressure.</p> <p>But on March 17, after the states passed their rules calling for a Reid Vapor Pressure of 9 pounds, the Federal Government announced a national standard of 10.5 pounds, which would still have reduced evaporation of gasoline, but by a smaller amount.</p> <p>Yesterday, however, the department said it would soon propose that it allow the stricter standard in New York and New Jersey. Its procedure is to propose such a rule, wait 30 days for public comment, and then make a final ruling. Threat by Massachusetts</p> <p>The agency proposed such a change for Massachusetts on Feb. 23, after that state threatened to sue to get a ruling. It made the same move for Connecticut and Rhode Island on March 16.</p> <p>The oil industry voluntarily varies the Reid Vapor Pressure by time of year, and had argued that a pressure of 9 would make for difficult automobile starts on cold mornings. The industry also pointed out that producing gasoline with a lower Reid Vapor Pressure means using more gallons of crude oil per gallon of gasoline, and that instituting the change would result in higher gasoline imports, and higher costs.</p> <p>Proponents, however, say that the cost will be under 2 cents a gallon, and that for the volume of contaminants removed, the solution is cheaper than anti-pollution measures imposed on factories and other sources of air pollution.</p>
590638>COMPANY NEWS: Corporate Green Warrior; Sun Oil Takes Environmental Pledge The Valdez Principles, a code of corporate environmental conduct devised after the 1989 Alaskan oil spill, won its first major corporate endorsement yesterday. And the company that signed on is an oil company. The Sun Company of Philadelphia, the 12th-largest oil company in the United States, became the first Fortune 500 company to endorse the principles. Fifty smaller companies have already backed them.  <p>In May, a resolution endorsing the principles was submitted at the company&#39;s shareholder meeting by the New York City pension system but drew just 6 percent support. After the vote, though, management met with the principles&#39; backers and worked out a compromise.</p> <p>Sun negotiated various &quot;adaptations&quot; of the principles to fit its business. For example, the first of the 10 principles, protection of the biosphere, says, &quot;We will reduce and make continual progress toward eliminating the release of any substance that may cause environmental damage to the air, water, or the earth or its inhabitants.&quot; Some environmentalists would say that includes the pollutants that are released when Sun&#39;s gasoline is burned, as well as the carbon dioxide that adds to global warming. and is released when Sun&#39;s gasoline is burned.</p> <p>In the statement adopted by Sun, the company says, &quot;We will reduce our overall emissions to the environment (air, water and land) with special emphasis on toxic substances.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;This is not a commitment to go out of the petrochemical business or the fuels business,&quot; Sun&#39;s chairman and chief executive, Robert H. Campbell, said at a ceremony in New York yesterday. But, he said, there was &quot;tremendous philosophical congruence&quot; between what Sun was already doing and the environmental principles. He said, though, that he did not foresee major changes in company operations.</p> <p>The principles were renamed last year and now known as Ceres, for Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies. Joan Bavaria, co-chairwoman of Ceres, said discussions were continuing with other oil companies. Exxon is not among them, she said.</p>
1367213>Inquiry Shows Possible Flaw In Jet Rudders The inquiry into the crash of an American Airlines plane in Queens three months ago has shown that a passenger jet can break up in flight if the rudder suddenly flips back and forth, investigators said today. Pilots should be trained that such a breakup can occur even at the low speeds that rudder movements had previously been considered safe, the investigators added.  <p>Government rules on how strong an airplane&#39;s tail must be do not take into account sudden back-and-forth rudder movements like those that occurred in the last moments of American Airlines Flight 587, the National Transportation Safety Board said.</p> <p>In fact, the board said, in some cases a fairly light tap on the rudder pedals may be enough to cause structural damage. If the pilot reverses the rudder just as the plane reaches its limit in one direction, investigators said, the movement can overload the tail, which they say may have happened to Flight 587.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It is possible, particularly with reverse action, to do catastrophic damage to the tail assembly,&#39;&#39; said Marion C. Blakey, the board chairwoman.</p> <p>In an unusual response, the Federal Aviation Administration immediately said that it agreed with the substance of the recommendation and would make a formal answer shortly. The safety board recommendations are advisory; the F.A.A. sets pilot training requirements.</p> <p>The recommendation is in contrast to a text jointly developed by Airbus, Boeing and major airlines on recovering from aircraft &#39;&#39;upsets.&#39;&#39; That training tool, as the safety board pointed out today, stresses that &#39;&#39;pilots must be prepared to use full control authority when necessary.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The plane in the Queens crash on Nov. 12 had just passed through turbulence created by a Boeing 747 that was five miles ahead; the co-pilot, at the controls, may have been using the rudder to steady the plane.</p> <p>The crash killed all 260 people on board and 5 more on the ground, on the Rockaway Peninsula. The plane, an Airbus A-300, had just taken off from Kennedy Airport and was bound for the Dominican Republic. The rudder and then the vertical portion of the tail, to which the rudder was attached, fell off the plane, the first time that has happened to a passenger jet.</p> <p>The board said that the problem might extend to all big jets, not just Airbuses, and not just those with tails made of composites, as the tail on the A-300 is. The board, which based its recommendation on calculations of side stresses that would have been produced by the plane that crashed and the rudder movements that were recorded, is still trying to determine whether there was a pre-existing weakness in the tail. The board is also continuing to investigate whether the rudder moved because the pilots pushed the pedals, or whether it moved because of a mechanical malfunction.</p> <p>Even if investigators determine that the rudder moved in response to &#39;&#39;pilot inputs,&#39;&#39; as engineers call it, Ms. Blakey stressed, &#39;&#39;this recommendation is about pilot education and training; it is not about pilot error.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But it is also about the standards used to certify the airplane as safe to fly. Those standards, used by both the F.A.A. and, in the case of the Airbus, its European counterpart, are taken by pilots to mean that a safety system called a rudder limiter will prevent them from overstressing the tail.</p> <p>In normal flight, using the rudder will turn the nose of the plane out of line with its direction of travel, like a car skidding on an icy road that points to the side without changing direction. In the air, it is called a yaw. In a big airplane, in which the tail is 100 feet or more behind the center of gravity, a yaw can produce large pressures on the vertical tail.</p> <p>The rudder limiter on the A-300 and many similar planes blocks the rudder from moving too far and creating a dangerous yaw. The faster the plane flies, the closer the limiter holds the rudder to the neutral position. Aircraft builders calculate the maximum force that the yaw can produce and design the plane to survive 50 percent more.</p> <p>If the rudder is pushed to its limit, the plane will swing hard, and because of its momentum, will reach maximum yaw and then settle back slightly toward straight, in a new equilibrium.</p> <p>The problem is that the certification test assumes that when the plane reaches maximum yaw, the rudder is held steady or returned to neutral position, and that the rudder is not pushed in the opposite direction until the plane has reached equilibrium. In the case of the Queens crash, the rudder appears to have moved in the opposite direction at the moment of maximum yaw, and that may have overstressed the tail.</p> <p>That possibility was first raised publicly by Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology magazine on Jan. 21, after it conducted its own analysis.</p> <p>This was news to many pilots. &#39;&#39;The traditional wisdom is that the rudder limiter will prevent you from exceeding the certification limit,&#39;&#39; said a senior captain at another airline who has trained scores of pilots on using the rudder.</p> <p>But the captain, who did not want to be further identified added, &#39;&#39;there are no maneuvers we teach at all that would require you to use full rudder in one direction, then another direction.&#39;&#39;</p>
1489792>Tests Help Rule Out Tile Damage as Cause of Shuttle Loss New tests show that it would have been very difficult for falling debris to inflict major damage on the tiles on the underside of the shuttle Columbia during its launching in January, a member of the board investigating its fatal accident said today. The findings do not bear directly on the board&#39;s working hypothesis about the cause of the disaster: that a breach in the leading edge of the left wing, not its underside, admitted superheated gases when the shuttle re-entered Earth&#39;s atmosphere the morning of Feb. 1.  <p>But the tests -- in which engineers blasted chunks of insulation foam at a mock-up of tiles on a main landing-gear door -- could help rule out tile damage. They also lay the groundwork for further testing of the leading-edge hypothesis.</p> <p>Before the crash, NASA had data about debris striking tile, but little about impacts on reinforced carbon-carbon, the material from which the edge is made.</p> <p>The board member, G. Scott Hubbard, said that setting up such tests on the leading edge would not be easy. He cited the uncertainty about the angle at which the debris hit, and the rotation of the debris itself, which, spinning like a propeller, would add energy to the impact.</p> <p>Mr. Hubbard, who is the director of the NASA Ames Research Center, spoke with reporters in Houston, and by conference call. He said the tests, which were conducted in the last few days at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, produced &#39;&#39;little to no damage,&#39;&#39; ripping off small parts of the top layer of the tiles.</p> <p>The investigators started with the landing-gear doors because they thought the breach that doomed the Columbia might have occurred there; sensors recorded elevated temperatures in the wheel well.</p> <p>Further analysis has shown that the most likely area of impact was the leading edge of the wing. So the investigators have used tests on the door mock-up to calibrate their equipment, which includes a gun with a 30-foot barrel that fires chunks of foam at speeds of nearly 800 feet a second, or more than 500 miles a hour.</p> <p>Cameras record the action at up to 7,000 frames a second. The test assembly measures strain and acceleration in the target.</p> <p>After intensive analysis of the video record of the Columbia&#39;s liftoff, engineers now believe that the foam that struck the wing was about 1,240 cubic inches, weighing about 2 pounds, traveling about 775 feet a second.</p> <p>They will soon begin shooting foam of that mass at a mock-up of the leading edge, but may add to the speed. Mr. Hubbard said that if the foam was spinning rapidly, the added energy could have been the equivalent of increasing its velocity by several hundred feet a second. One hundred feet a second is 68 miles an hour.</p> <p>The first mock-up will use fiberglass, which is slightly stronger than the material on the shuttle, reinforced carbon-carbon. But later the technicians will install actual panels, taken from one of the three surviving shuttles, the Discovery, Mr. Hubbard said.</p> <p>A problem for the investigators is that the angle of impact depends on precisely where the debris hit, because the leading edge is a curved surface. They believe that the angle was 20 degrees or less, but how much less they do not know.</p> <p>Another problem is that while the tiles are supported beneath their entire surface, the carbon panels are supported only at the edges. Thus, their vulnerability to debris could depend on precisely where they were struck.</p> <p>The status of the foam tests could be a subject on Wednesday when Harold W. Gehman Jr., the retired admiral who is the board&#39;s chairman, is scheduled to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee. Sean O&#39;Keefe, the NASA administrator, is also scheduled to testify. The hearing was delayed by the war in Iraq.</p> <p>Another issue emerging between the board and Congress is access to interviews conducted by board investigators with NASA and contractor personnel. In military style, the board granted many of the people it interviewed &#39;&#39;privilege,&#39;&#39; meaning that the transcripts will remain confidential.</p> <p>Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, has demanded access to the transcripts. It is not clear, however, whether others in Congress will also press for such access.</p>
805970>In Reversal of 20-Year Trend, Traffic Deaths Increase in U.S. Traffic deaths rose last year for the second year in a row, a sure sign that a 20-year trend toward greater safety has reversed, the National Safety Council said this week. Moreover, the council said in a report issued on Wednesday, the number of highway deaths is likely to rise in the coming years because of an increasing amount of traffic and because Congress is poised to raise speed limits, limit the need for motorcycle helmets and ease truck regulations.  <p>Motor vehicle deaths reached a peak in 1972, at 56,278, and by 1992 had dropped to 40,982. But according to the council&#39;s annual report, which covered accidents of all sorts, they rose to 42,200 in 1993 and hit 43,000 last year, for a 4.9 percent increase over two years.</p> <p>&quot;An increase in one year doesn&#39;t mean much; two years in a row is cause for concern,&quot; said Alan F. Hoskin, manager of the statistics department for the safety council, a private, not-for-profit group based in Itasca, Ill.</p> <p>The number of vehicle miles traveled rose about 2 percent last year, as it does in most years, which means that all things being equal, the absolute number of traffic deaths will rise every year. The death rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled has been fairly flat since 1992, and last year stood at 1.83. In 1972 it was more than twice as high, at 4.43.</p> <p>The National Highway System bill, which is now before House and Senate negotiators, is likely to eliminate the Federal speed limit -- 55 miles an hour except on rural interstates, where it is 65 miles an hour -- in favor of letting the states set their own limits. The bill would also ease regulations on trucks that are not tractor-trailers.</p> <p>Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said the lifting of the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit on rural interstates was already causing an additional 700 deaths a year, and that raising the limit on all Federal roads would raise the number of traffic fatalities by another 4,800 a year. In addition, Ms. Claybrook said, reducing the number of truck regulations would bring about another 700 deaths annually.</p> <p>The council annually counts accident deaths of all kinds, and said on Wednesday that the total for last year was 92,200, up 1 percent from 1993. The 1994 figure is down 21 percent from the all-time high, which is 116,385, in 1969. Measured against population size, the progress is even greater, with the number of deaths per 100,000 people dropping 38.8 percent since 1969.</p> <p>There were also 18.6 million disabling injuries last year, the council said, of which 2.1 million were from motor vehicle crashes. Motor vehicle crashes cost society about $176.5 billion last year, the council said, the biggest component of which was lost wages.</p> <p>The council also counted firearms-related deaths and injuries that were treated in hospital emergency rooms, for the 12 months ending in May 1993. It found that of the 78,200 injuries, 25.2 percent were accidental. Of the 19,200 deaths, 7.9 percent were accidental shootings.</p> <p>Last year was a bad one for aviation, especially compared with the previous year. There were 264 deaths on airlines in 1994, up from 25 the year before. For the major airlines, the rate of fatal accidents was quadruple the prior year, as measured by accidents per 100 million aircraft miles, at eight-tenths vs. two-tenths.</p> <p>But the rate was still extremely low compared with other modes of travel. &quot;A lousy year in aviation would be a great year in highway safety,&quot; said Jane S. Roemer, executive director of the council. Air fatalities get more attention because they happen in multiples and &quot;we are inured to highway deaths,&quot; she said. &quot;The shock value has worn off, because they happen one at a time, around the country,&quot; she said. But the 43,000 works out to about 118 a day.</p>
1376153>Air Traffic Is Off Almost Everywhere, but the Dip Is Uneven In the five full months after the Sept. 11 attacks, the number of flights at the nation&#39;s 31 major hub airports declined by 12.2 percent from the corresponding period the year before, the Federal Aviation Administration said today. But the drop was much sharper at Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports in New York, Ronald Reagan National here in Washington and Los Angeles International, among others. The data are in the aviation agency&#39;s annual forecast, being formally issued on Tuesday, which envisions  air traffic remaining depressed this year but returning to preattack levels in 2003.  <p>The forecast makes three assumptions: continued economic recovery,  only small increases in fuel prices and no more terrorist attacks.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Clearly we are counting on no further terrorist events of major consequence,&#39;&#39; said John M. Rodgers, the agency&#39;s director of aviation policy and plans. &#39;&#39;That is the assumption that we all hope for.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The air-traffic statistics collected by the agency paint a clear picture of a severe but uneven impact from the Sept. 11 attacks.</p> <p>Affected the worst was Reagan National Airport, which was shut completely until early October and has started up again only gradually. From Oct. 1 through Feb. 28, the period covered in the statistics, National lost 56.1 percent of its commercial operations, and 62.5 percent of all operations, including general aviation and military flights.</p> <p>Next-worst was Los Angeles International, which lost 22.5 percent of commercial operations, followed by La Guardia, at 21.1 percent, and Kennedy, at 21.0. The other major airport in the New York area, Newark International, was off 13 percent.</p> <p>The only gains in commercial operations were the 10.4 percent at Salt Lake City, where the Winter Olympics were held, and 4.2 percent at Minneapolis-St. Paul. Charlotte, N.C.; Cincinnati; Pittsburgh; and Baltimore-Washington International recorded only small losses. But like airports in Los Angeles and New York, others on the East and West Coasts, including those at San Francisco, Boston and Seattle-Tacoma, fared badly.</p> <p>In the current fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, the number of people boarding airplanes will drop 12 percent from last year, to 600.3 million, the agency predicted.</p> <p>While the aviation agency recorded sharp declines in flights by the major carriers in the five months through Feb. 28, it found growth in flights by regional planes, which it defines as those with 70 seats or fewer.</p> <p>That change is partly attributable to design. Because of cost efficiencies, the large carriers, which in many cases own all or part of regional lines, are shifting business to them, Mr. Rodgers said. Given the current unsettled state of security, the regional carriers face new competition from travelers&#39; cars, and in some cases from rail service. But Mr. Rodgers predicted that regional planes would become more prevalent, quadrupling in number by 2013, to 2,900 from the current 700.</p> <p>While commercial aviation was suffering after Sept. 11, military flights from the hub airports were not, rising 4.5 percent. General aviation, on the other hand, comprising private planes and corporate jets, dropped 22.7 percent.</p> <p>The Air Transport Association, which represents the major carriers, said today that losses exceeded $7 billion in 2001, about $4 billion more than had been expected before Sept. 11 because of a recession-related slump in air travel. Airlines parked or retired 350 planes after Sept. 11, the association said, including 101 Boeing 727&#39;s, by far the largest category idled.</p> <p>One result of the retirements is that load factors -- the proportion of seats that are filled -- are expected to rise to 72.3 percent this year, from 71.3 percent last year. Still, the break-even load factor for last year was 77 percent, the association said.</p> <p>The aviation agency said that despite the slowdown, it believed that traffic would return and that it should press ahead with improvements in air traffic control. &#39;&#39;If we delay that investment now, we would just be ruing the day two years from now or three years from now,&#39;&#39; said Louise Maillett, the agency&#39;s acting assistant administrator for policy, planning and international aviation.</p> <p>At the Air Transport Association, Michael Wascom, a spokesman, agreed that &#39;&#39;now is not the time to put everything on the back burner.&#39;&#39;</p>
403641>Washington to New York on 4.3 Gallons Some drivers are not willing to trade size and smooth ride for fuel economy, but for those who are, no car sold in the United States gets better gasoline mileage than the Geo Metro. On a recent drive from Washington to New York, the car, made in Japan by the Suzuki Motor Company and sold by the General Motors Corporation, consumed 4.3 gallons, which comes to 58 miles a gallon. The Metro&#39;s fuel economy, as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency, is 54 miles a gallon. The average car on the road in 1990 gets 20 miles a gallon, according to the Department of Energy. If every car did as well as the Metro, gasoline consumption, now about 7.3 million barrels a day, would fall to 2.7 million barrels a day, a drop of 4.6 million barrels.  <p>Last year, imports averaged 8.1 million barrels a day, so such a switch -- if not accompanied by an increase in the number of cars or the average number of miles each was driven -- would cut imports by more than half. High Technology</p> <p>The Metro does the job through high technology and plain old shrinkage. The Metro weighs 1,600 pounds, halfway between an intermediate car and a bicycle.</p> <p>Part of the weight loss is from the engine, which is a mere 157 pounds. It is made of aluminum and has three cylinders. (Dropping the fourth cylinder adds six miles a gallon, G.M. engineers say.) To compensate for its small size, the engine squeezes the fuel-air mixture to nine times atmospheric pressure before lighting the spark, a higher ratio than in most cars, allowing more horsepower for each pound of engine weight.</p> <p>The five-speed manual transmission is wired to a light on the dashboard that reminds the driver when to shift up. The light urges shifting when revolutions per minute are low relative to when most drivers would shift on their own. That raises mileage at the expense of performance.</p> <p>With its low weight, the car does not need power steering, which adds weight to other cars. The copy that General Motors keeps for test drives lacks even ordinary refinements like a passenger-side mirror and a rear-window defogger.</p> <p>The model driven to Washington had an ashtray but no lighter, and no radio. And while plusher versions are available, the Metro is designed as a price leader as well as a mileage leader. The Metro is the least expensive model in the Geo line, with a list price for the 1990 version at just under $6,000.</p> <p>The car handles nimbly and its performance is nothing special, a compliment for a car with mileage 200 percent over average. Pulling from a line of stopped traffic on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway into the adjacent lane, where the traffic was moving at about 50 miles an hour, the Metro performed much as any other small car would. Coming out of the toll booth at the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, it reached 55 miles an hour in about 15 seconds, as fast as other cars were accelerating.</p> <p>It does this on 58 horsepower, about half the average. But it does leave the driver feeling in much more intimate contact with the road and all of its bumps. And designers have shrunk the back seat to a size functional for no one but small children.</p>
1826433>Making High-Flying Guests Fuel-Efficient ENVIRONMENTALLY conflicted couples can &#39;&#39;offset&#39;&#39; the global warming impact of their celebrations by purchasing carbon credits from a company that helps reduce emissions of climate-changing gases. Such companies help finance windmills that replace coal-burning power plants, for example, or help pay for projects to gather cow manure and use it to make methane that is burned for electricity. That replaces coal and stops emissions of unburned methane, itself a global warming gas. One company, TerraPass, offers a product that appears on Expedia, the travel Web site: shoppers can buy a pass to offset their flight.  <p>&#39;&#39;When you do the math of a wedding,&#39;&#39; said Tom Arnold, the chief environmental officer at TerraPass, it&#39;s flying that has the biggest environmental impact. There are other ways to make travel more earth-friendly. &#39;&#39;I have pitched my girlfriend, who I hope will be my fiancée, that we should go on tour, instead of everybody coming to see us,&#39;&#39; Mr. Arnold said. So far, she has not consented to that plan (or to a wedding).</p> <p>Burning a gallon of gasoline or of jet fuel produces approximately equal amounts of carbon dioxide. The airlines say that that each gallon moves a passenger about 20 miles, so a 1,000-mile trip would use about 50 gallons. (At TerraPass, a pass for such a trip would cost $9.95.) A large sedan on the highway would also go about 20 miles on a gallon, but would be much more efficient per person if it is carrying three or four people.</p> <p>MATTHEW L. WALD</p>
1779533>F.A.A. Redirects Air Traffic Controllers The Federal Aviation Administration has rescheduled air traffic controllers at seven of its busiest radar offices to assure that at least 70 percent of the controllers on shift are always at their radar scopes. The agency hopes that the change will cut costs and errors. But controllers say that they are working without breaks longer than rules allow and that their supervisors have lost the flexibility to assign rest periods based on how hectic a job has been.  <p>The controllers union has filed several grievances relating to the change, the latest result of an agency campaign to cut labor costs.</p> <p>The schedule change covers Terminal Radar Approach Controls, known as Tracons, which generally handle traffic on approach to airports or on departure, and at low altitude. It applies to New York, Northern California, Southern California, Dallas/Fort Worth, Atlanta, Chicago and Potomac, the Washington area.</p> <p>The agency recently declared an impasse in contract negotiations and imposed a contract on the controllers union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. Both the old contract and the new one say that the controllers will not work more than two hours at a stretch, if &#39;&#39;operational conditions&#39;&#39; allow.</p> <p>An internal F.A.A. memorandum, dated July 6, from the manager of the New York Tracon told subordinate managers there that &#39;&#39;it is the expectation of the Air Traffic Organization and myself that operational resources are used effectively and efficiently,&#39;&#39; and that 70 percent of the controllers in the building should be at their scopes, or in training or briefings.</p> <p>At the New York Tracon, Phil Barbarello, a regional vice president of the union, said the number of controllers on duty had previously been varied according to the traffic level, which rises and falls sharply over a shift. Now, Mr. Barbarello said, controllers were often on duty when the workload was light, and got shorter breaks.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It used to be an hour lunch, now it&#39;s 45 minutes at best,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;and a half-hour break is now 20 minutes at best.&#39;&#39; Returning to work after 20 minutes, he said, &#39;&#39;your mind hasn&#39;t even calmed down yet.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Several conditions of controller employment recognize the level of concentration the job requires. For example, controllers must retire at age 56.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the aviation agency, Laura J. Brown, said that the idea of the scheduling change had arisen at a meeting of Tracon managers from around the country. &#39;&#39;The whole point,&#39;&#39; Ms. Brown said, was to improve safety. More controllers at work means fewer planes per controller, she said, and that should reduce &#39;&#39;operational errors&#39;&#39; in which planes are directed nearer each other than the rules allow.</p> <p>Controllers argue the opposite, saying that handling more traffic and then having a slightly longer break is safer.</p> <p>At the Potomac Tracon, Chris Sutherland, a union representative, said that airports in the Washington area had &#39;&#39;huge arrival and departure banks which require that every piece of personnel we have be plugged in, working a radar scope,&#39;&#39; but that those busy times died down and people could be sent on breaks to &#39;&#39;get them fresh and safe and ready&#39;&#39; for the next busy period.</p> <p>In fact, the connection between traffic levels and operational errors is unclear. A report on the New York Tracon prepared last year by the F.A.A. said that operational errors there occurred mostly during times of moderate volume, with controllers working eight aircraft, and that the national average was 6.9. That is considered a moderate workload.</p> <p>At the New York Tracon, Timon Kalpaxis, who works in the Newark airport section, said jobs there varied widely. &#39;&#39;One guy could be working final all day,&#39;&#39; Mr. Kalpaxis said, referring to the controller who lines planes up for landing. &#39;&#39;And another guy could have it really cushy.&#39;&#39; But the new system does not take account of that, he said.</p> <p>Ms. Brown of the F.A.A. said that &#39;&#39;there&#39;s enough flexibility in the system,&#39;&#39; even with the 70 percent rule in place, and that &#39;&#39;if they&#39;re having a hard time doing that, they can back off the 70 percent.&#39;&#39;</p>
719894>State Outlines a Far Different Lilco Trying to sell the Cuomo administration&#39;s plan for a $9 billion government takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, state officials have been telling Long Islanders that what the state wants is not just government ownership, but an overhaul of the company. S. David Freeman, the president of the New York Power Authority, who would manage the transformation, outlined plans yesterday for the Suffolk County Legislature: solar cells, which make electricity directly from sunlight; fuel cells, which make electricity from gas or oil without combustion; help for homeowners in making energy improvements, and thousands of trees, planted on the south sides of buildings to cut the need for air-conditioning.  And there would be a new role for the power system -- fostering economic development.  <p>Lilco officials and some outside experts are skeptical that any of this is economically viable. Perhaps more important, it is not clear how State Senator George E. Pataki, the Republican candidate for governor, would react if he were elected; he has said only that he would have to look at the details of a state takeover.</p> <p>Mr. Freeman, whom Mr. Cuomo appointed six months ago, is leading the effort to promote the takeover. He spoke at a news conference in Mineola, L.I., on Friday and was back on Long Island yesterday, describing not only the promised 10 percent cut in electricity rates, but also his vision for an electric system with a different feeling. It would be, he said, a system with &quot;the people being in charge of their power system, the consumers being the owners.&quot;</p> <p>The idea would be to create an innovative utility oriented toward limiting demand and making electricity in environmentally benign ways.</p> <p>But Mr. Freeman is fighting a difficult battle. Even David Roe, an electricity expert at the Environmental Defense Fund, a national environmental group, said that the value of conservation investments was less clear at a time when electricity is abundant.</p> <p>&quot;The big savings used to be that you don&#39;t have to build the next plant, but we&#39;re not in that era now,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a tough one for environmentalists,&quot; he said, though conservation programs like those Mr. Freeman favors still pay in terms of reduced emissions from power plants.</p> <p>Mr. Freeman, however, insists that his plans make sense, and that he accomplished the goals he has laid out for Lilco in his last job, as general manager of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, in California.</p> <p>Lilco could have been described as innovative and risk-taking in the 1960&#39;s; it ordered three nuclear reactors and invested in a uranium mine, with results that are now infamous. Even the uranium mine went sour.</p> <p>The utility concentrated on conservation in the early 90&#39;s when it appeared that junking Shoreham would lead to electricity shortages, but it recently asked the Public Service Commission for permission to reduce its expenditures in that area. The commission replied that if the company could achieve the same power reductions with less expenditure, it was welcome to do so.</p> <p>In his talk to the Suffolk Legislature yesterday, Mr. Freeman said he would take a far more aggressive approach to conservation than Lilco has in the past.</p> <p>In Sacramento, he paid bounties for old refrigerators to encourage customers to retire inefficient models and replace them with new ones. He also installed photovoltaic cells, which make power directly from sunlight, on the grounds of the company&#39;s defunct nuclear reactor, and had utility crews plant millions of trees on the south sides of houses, to put them in shade during the summer.</p> <p>On Long Island, Mr. Freeman said, he would like to install fuel cells, which combine oxygen from air with hydrogen from oil or natural gas, to make water and electricity, as well as photovoltaic cells.</p> <p>Lilco has taken a different approach.</p> <p>&quot;Our view is that conservation should be pursued insofar as it makes economic sense and helps us avoid building new power plants,&quot; said Suzanne Halpin, a spokeswoman. The company has spent more than $110 million on conservation since the late 1980&#39;s, she said. But she argued that too much conservation now, when energy demand is down and the region is coming out of a recession, could lead to a decline in revenue and force Lilco to seek higher rates.</p> <p>&quot;Mr. Freeman has a different view,&quot; Ms. Halpin said, &quot;that energy conservation is good in and of itself.&quot;</p> <p>Others, too, doubt that efficiency investments by the utilities really work.</p> <p>People who accept subsidies to buy better light bulbs, refrigerators, windows or other energy-saving devices &quot;are basically in it for the free lunch,&quot; said John P. Hughes, the technical director of the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, a Washington-based group that represents big industrial users of power. Since the cost of the subsidies flows into everyone&#39;s electric bills, those users pay the cost of raising the efficiency of others.</p> <p>&quot;People will take the rebate on the light bulb or whatever, and then they&#39;ll buy a new appliance,&quot; Mr. Hughes said. &quot;You&#39;re stimulating an acquisition mentality of the upper income class. Where real conservation comes from is poor people&#39;s response to higher electric bills.&quot;</p> <p>Lilco is an unusual candidate for conversion to public ownership. For one thing, the average public power system in this country has fewer than 2,000 customers; Lilco has about a million. For another, the era of conversion to public power ended about 50 years ago.</p> <p>But Mr. Freeman has said repeatedly that there is no point in public ownership unless the public sector is going to perform differently than private companies.</p> <p>In his view, Lilco would be a national model for clean energy sources. He would also like to turn the electric system into a force for economic development on the Island -- offering incentive rates to new industries -- rather than a drag, as it has been for years because of rates that are the highest of any major company in the nation.</p>
1533019>Page Two: Oct. 26-Nov. 1; A Space Shuttle Rescue, After the Fact IT would have looked a lot like something from a science fiction movie, but there could have been a rescue option for the space shuttle Columbia, which broke apart on Feb. 1, according to a report released last week by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. If NASA had recognized early on that the shuttle had been damaged at liftoff, the report said, it could have ordered the seven Columbia astronauts to conserve oxygen by minimizing all physical activity. The astronauts would have slept 8 hours a day, or maybe 12, and could have survived in orbit four weeks, instead of two.  <p>The space shuttle Atlantis could have been readied for a launch by March 1, with technicians working in shifts around the clock. Atlantis was designed for seven crew members but would have launched with four, so that the Columbia astronauts could squeeze in, some sitting on the floor.</p> <p>The ships would have parked back-to-back, at 90 degree angles, so the air locks in the cargo bays would be near each other and so their tails would not collide. An Atlantis astronaut with a jet pack called an Extravehicular Mobility Unit would have hopped over to the Columbia, carrying more jet packs and canisters to clean up the air. The Columbia astronauts would have donned the jet packs, and moved into the Atlantis, following a tether (see illustration above).</p> <p>Some Columbia astronauts had no extravehicular training at all; normal training time is nearly a year. The Atlantis astronauts would have guided them.</p> <p>The plan was developed by NASA at the request of the investigation board, months after the crash. An unresolved and unanswerable question was the double-or-nothing nature of another launch, using the same flawed foam insulation. Would NASA have tried to launch a second shuttle with the same potential for disaster?</p> <p>MATTHEW L. WALD</p>
1760995>Plan to Reshape Mileage Standards Could Buoy Detroit Of all the proposals that $3-a-gallon gasoline has elicited from Congress, the one that would do the least to bring down high gasoline prices might be higher fuel economy standards for cars, at least in the next 5 to 10 years, experts say. But it could help Detroit automakers, which might be just as much of a motivation for a change.  <p>Conservation advocates have called for higher mileage standards for years, but they and other car experts agree that during periods of high gasoline prices, the government standards, called Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE standards, are irrelevant, because consumers buy smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles without prompting.</p> <p>For 2005, with a government requirement for a minimum average for cars of 27.5 miles per gallon, the preliminary estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency is that the actual average was 28.9 m.p.g.</p> <p>Falling gasoline prices illustrate the value of the standards, said Kateri Callahan, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group based here.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;What you&#39;re doing with CAFE is saying, as a society, there&#39;s a minimum level of fuel efficiency that we think ought to be offered,&#39;&#39; Ms. Callahan said. &#39;&#39;History shows that when, and if, energy is cheap again, and people fall back into old and bad habits, you want to make sure they can act only so badly.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>At that point, the standards limit the growth of oil imports and the average fuel economy of the fleet, and help with the balance of payments problem in the long term. That is what happened in this country in the 1990&#39;s, when a price war between Persian Gulf oil producers pushed the price of a barrel below $10.</p> <p>But when CAFE standards were being introduced in the 1980&#39;s, the average fuel economy of vehicles sold exceeded government mandates for much of the period. That was partly a result of the oil price spike of 1979-1980, which still ranks as the most severe when prices are adjusted for inflation.</p> <p>The provision of the energy bill proposed by Senate Republican leaders, and endorsed last month by President Bush, does not explicitly call for higher standards. Instead, it calls for allowing the Transportation Department to restructure the CAFE rules for cars, as it recently did for trucks.</p> <p>There is no strong indication that the Bush administration will raise the magic number significantly. And transportation officials already have the power to raise the number, without any action by Congress.</p> <p>What those officials want Congress to approve is legislation that would allow them to reorganize the standards, as they recently did for light trucks. Transportation officials say they would like to create a sliding scale for minimum fuel economy, based on &#39;&#39;footprint,&#39;&#39; or distance between the wheels. They say they are seeking this authority because of a study by the National Academy of Sciences that showed that forcing people into smaller vehicles had led to a slight increase in traffic deaths.</p> <p>The administration wants to keep vehicle size constant but to force automakers to use materials and technologies that will improve fuel economy in whatever size vehicle is offered.</p> <p>In March, when transportation officials rewrote the truck standard, the new rules demanded only a small increase in overall mileage, although they pushed the minimum required fuel economy for some small sport utility vehicles to above the level now required for cars.</p> <p>Setting the standard vehicle by vehicle is important because existing car standards make no difference to some manufacturers. For example, for 2005, the most recent year for which statistics are available, Toyota and Honda both averaged 33.1 m.p.g., partly because they sold a lot of small cars, and they had no CAFE concerns.</p> <p>DaimlerChrysler averaged 26.6, and Ford, 26.9, and unlike Toyota and Honda, both manufacturers had to worry about technology and sales mix. If cars were judged individually, even small cars that performed poorly considering their size would have to be improved. Thus, the burden would fall for the first time on companies that make mostly smaller cars, generally imports.</p> <p>The actual importance of these miles per gallon figures is also diluted somewhat by oddities of the testing procedure and rules that allow adjustments to the numbers. CAFE numbers are 15 percent higher than window-sticker numbers, and even the numbers on the window sticker are higher than what most drivers will achieve.</p> <p>In addition, automakers may earn a credit of up to 1.2 miles per gallon for building &#39;&#39;flex fuel&#39;&#39; vehicles that can run on something other than gasoline. Almost all of these are cars capable of burning ethanol, although most of them will never see ethanol beyond the 10 percent sometimes blended into ordinary gasoline.</p> <p>Car makers can also carry over credits from previous years or borrow them from future years, which is why Ford is unlikely to pay penalties and DaimlerChrysler may not have to either, despite being below 27.5 miles per gallon.</p> <p>Some policy makers are counting on new CAFE standards for a different purpose, though.</p> <p>Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House Science Committee and a longtime advocate of higher standards, said that adopting them now would send a signal to automobile companies that investments in new tooling and technology to produce high-mileage vehicles will pay back for years to come. It will also stimulate inventors with new ideas, Mr. Boehlert said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They will come out of the woodwork,&#39;&#39; he said.</p>
1820025>Flying the Crowded Skies: Challenges for Aviation By 2025, government experts say, America&#39;s skies will swarm with three times as many planes, and not just the kind of traffic flying today. There will be thousands of tiny jets, seating six or fewer, at airliner altitudes, competing for space with remotely operated drones that need help avoiding midair collisions, and with commercially operated rockets carrying satellites and tourists into space. To keep passengers moving safely and on schedule, the Federal Aviation Administration needs to replace a half-century of outmoded technology with a new air traffic control system. But almost everything about the proposed new system is unsettled, not only its digital nuts and bolts, but also the leadership, the financing and the staffing of a modern aviation network.  <p>What technology will be adopted, and how will airlines and the government, with its Aviation Trust Fund at its lowest level in decades, pay their shares? How will the government hire and train all the air traffic controllers it needs -- almost as many new recruits, in the next seven years, as are at work today? And how will the F.A.A. coordinate with NASA, the Pentagon and others?</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There&#39;s a consensus that there is technology out there that could help,&#39;&#39; said Roger Cohen, the president of the Regional Airline Association, one of many interest groups in the fractious aviation world.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There certainly isn&#39;t a consensus, from the aviation community, on how the system will get paid for,&#39;&#39; Mr. Cohen said. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s pretty obvious.&#39;&#39; So far, he said, &#39;&#39;there&#39;s no consensus on any of the details.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But an overhaul is essential. In a recent simulation, the F.A.A. increased traffic until controllers were overloaded, an increase of about 25 percent, the pace the F.A.A. expects to reach in about a decade.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The system we have today is essentially not scalable,&#39;&#39; said Bobby Sturgell, deputy administrator of the F.A.A., at an air traffic conference in October. &#39;&#39;You&#39;re going to hit a wall.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Marion C. Blakey, the agency&#39;s administrator, estimates that delays caused by air traffic will be 62 percent higher in 2014 than in 2004.</p> <p>Safety is not an issue, officials say, because managers will keep traffic levels down to what they can handle, by keeping planes waiting on the ground. The solution to moving more planes without creating a safety problem, the agency says, lies in new computing power and eventually on a new tracking and navigation system to replace radar technology dating from World War II with digital navigation aids.</p> <p>Making the new technologies fit together, said Russell G. Chew, head of the agency&#39;s Air Traffic Organization, is like solving Rubik&#39;s Cube.</p> <p>Today, the F.A.A. tracks planes in flight using radars that bounce signals off a plane&#39;s metal skin and on-board transponders that relay data showing a plane&#39;s identity and altitude. Pilots navigate mostly by signals from a network of F.A.A. radio beacons on the ground.</p> <p>The new system would do away with almost all of that and make use of the satellite-based Global Positioning System that is widely used outside aviation. The system allows every plane to check its precise location and to broadcast the information to all others on a computerized network. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s like the current transponder on steroids,&#39;&#39; Ed Rafacz, a Delta pilot and a representative of the Air Line Pilots Association, told a safety seminar.</p> <p>Eventually, planes will carry computers that automatically alter converging flight paths, keeping the system safe while saving money.</p> <p>The proposed solution is called the Next Generation Air Traffic System. The agency will soon publish a timetable for the project. The first step is to replace software that is decades old and running on computers that will be functionally obsolete in a few years, when I.B.M. stops providing technical support and spare parts.</p> <p>The F.A.A. is now spending a million dollars a day on new computers and the software to run them. The estimated cost of the project is $2.1 billion.</p> <p>F.A.A. officials and agency contractors say the computer replacement system is on time and on budget, unlike previous computer overhauls. Airlines would have to invest tens of thousands of dollars per plane to adapt. The international shipping company UPS has found that the changes can save money, but airlines, like the aviation agency, are notoriously slow to change.</p> <p>At the outset of this transformation, it is also unclear who will be running the agency. About 10 years ago, Congress decided to give the F.A.A. administrator a five-year term, to stabilize management and make modernization easier. The first administrator under the system, Jane Garvey, served from 1997 until 2002.</p> <p>Ms. Blakey, the incumbent, has said that she would serve out her term, which ends this year. But aviation experts wonder whether a Democratic Senate will be willing to confirm a replacement for five years, locking in President Bush&#39;s appointee for the next president&#39;s first term.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think the Democrats will let them name another administrator for the next five years,&#39;&#39; said John W. Douglass, president of the Aerospace Industries Association. &#39;&#39;The government tends to kind of slow down during the last two years of a two-term presidency, but air traffic isn&#39;t going to slow down.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Ms. Blakey says she is hoping to get Congress to act on something even more contentious than a new administrator: a new financing structure.</p> <p>The main source of revenue for the Aviation Trust Fund is a tax on passenger tickets. But as ticket prices have fallen, so has the agency&#39;s available capital, while demands on the system have mounted because of many new small airliners.</p> <p>Ms. Blakey would like to finance the agency through user fees, but there is no consensus on how the fees would be calculated.</p> <p>The airlines, which say they pay more than their share of costs, favor fees from corporate aviation and planes not owned by the airlines.</p> <p>Business aviation interests say that their planes fly from underused airfields and at off-peak times, and do not often overload the system.</p> <p>With the underlying law governing the F.A.A.&#39;s financing and expenditures expiring in September, there is little prospect in a divided government for achieving consensus on these issues. But experts said the cost of developing the next-generation system could run an extra $1 billion a year for the next few years and would thus require some new source of revenue. The Aviation Trust Fund balance is now below $2 billion, its lowest in decades.</p> <p>Another question is who will actually operate the system. For every five controllers now working, the agency will need to hire and train four more by 2015, to replace those who retire or change jobs. Most of those now working were hired in the early 1980s to replace 10,000 controllers fired by President Ronald Reagan after they went on strike.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If you hire them all at once, they&#39;re going to retire all at once,&#39;&#39; said Marvin L. Smith, the coordinator of the aeronautics master&#39;s degree program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.</p> <p>Mr. Smith said the ideal cycle for controllers would be like an investor&#39;s ideal bond portfolio: &#39;&#39;You want them to mature in a laddered fashion.&#39;&#39; The reason, he said, is that new controllers require on-the-job training, making it hard to absorb too many at once.</p> <p>The agency says it has improved tools for determining which recruits will make good controllers, and now has simulation labs with computers where they can be trained much as pilots are. But the agency has had limited success in measuring how fast it will have to replace them.</p> <p>In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the number of air traffic controllers retiring in the last fiscal year was underestimated by about 25 percent, the third year in a row of a major underestimate.</p> <p>Most controllers used to work until the mandatory retirement age because pensions were based on the final salary levels and pay was rising. In a contract last September, though, many controllers will not receive pay increases. Others have complained about recent changes in work rules.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s a pretty unhappy workplace right now,&#39;&#39; said James Hall, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.</p>
1345585>Inquiry Focus: Pilot Training In Emergencies Investigators looking for the cause of the crash in Queens a week ago that left 265 people dead are scrutinizing training for American Airlines pilots that involves unusual emphasis on using the rudder to regain control of an airplane thrown into an unusual angle. The plane that crashed, an Airbus A300, broke up in flight shortly after taking off from Kennedy International Airport and encountering the wake of a Boeing 747 a few miles ahead of it. Investigators believe that the tail fin, to which the rudder is attached, separated from the plane.  <p>The investigators say they have a great deal of information, much of it not yet analyzed. They remain unsure what led to the separation of the tail fin. Among the areas of inquiry is pilot performance.</p> <p>Their decision to concentrate on the fact that the American Airlines pilots had been trained to rely heavily on rudder controls during unusual events in the air could mean that they suspect such an action by the pilots may have placed unusual stress on the tail before the tail fin sheared away.</p> <p>But they also say that this crash, like most airliner crashes, is unlikely to have had a single cause, and that simple manipulation of the tail is unlikely to have caused an in-flight breakup.</p> <p>Investigators are studying, among other areas of inquiry, the procedure that American teaches its pilots for recovering from a severe left or right bank, which sometimes happens when a wake is encountered.</p> <p>Flight 587, carrying scores of Dominican immigrants bound for Santo Domingo, shook violently seconds after it bumped over the second of the two wakes it encountered. Initial information from the plane&#39;s flight data recorder indicated that the pilots were using the rudder as they struggled to deal with the suddenly shaking plane.</p> <p>Normally, to make an airplane return to level flight, pilots use movable surfaces on the wings called ailerons. Airlines teach pilots that they may also use the rudder in coordination with the ailerons. But some pilots, especially those with military experience, say that using the ailerons when the plane is at certain angles can make the wings lose lift, or stall.</p> <p>To prevent such a stall, American, more than other airlines, teaches its pilots to use the rudder to skid the airplane to one side. For example, if the airplane has rolled to the right -- that is, the right wing has dipped -- the pilot would move the rudder to the left to try to stabilize the plane.</p> <p>Both pilots of the plane that crashed had completed an American Airlines course in advanced maneuvers that included the rudder technique. Use of that technique might explain the sudden large rudder movements that were recorded in the last seconds that the flight data recorder operated, according to aviation experts. But investigators must still determine if the data was accurately recorded, and if the moves were what was ordered by the pilots from the cockpit.</p> <p>American Airlines has put all its pilots through an advanced maneuver program, which is supposed to teach them how to respond if they find their airplane at an angle not seen in routine flight; one situation covered in the course is encountering the wake of a Boeing 747.</p> <p>The course includes eight hours of classroom time and training in a simulator. One industry expert said it &#39;&#39;puts a high degree of emphasis on the use of the rudder to control extreme bank attitudes.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>At American, Marty Heires, a spokesman, said that the training did incorporate use of the rudder, but that this was &#39;&#39;within the specifications of the manufacturer. Airbus is aware of it.&#39;&#39; He added that &#39;&#39;in the past, we advocated a bit more aggressive use of the rudder, but now we&#39;re in line with the rest of the industry.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Some experts said that big movements of the rudder would put a strain on the tail fin, but would not explain why it separated, unless it already had some weakness.</p> <p>Aircraft manufacturers recognize the rudder as a tool for recovering from &#39;&#39;upsets&#39;&#39; in flight. One reason is that flight controls on the wings may become less effective if the angle of the wing to the oncoming air becomes too great.</p> <p>But a document jointly published by Airbus and Boeing in June 1998  cautions that in cases of high bank angle, &#39;&#39;only a small amount of rudder is needed. Too much rudder applied too quickly or held too long may result in loss of lateral and directional control or structural failure.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Among the failures that are possible is a change in airplane direction so sudden that the engines are ripped off. They weigh more than four tons each and because much of that mass is rotating, they can behave like giant gyroscopes, resisting changes in direction. In at least one previous A300 upset in which the plane changed direction rapidly, the pylons, which connect the engines to the wing, were heavily damaged.</p> <p>In the accident last week, the engines came down separately from the main wreckage.</p> <p>American Airlines said today that it had completed the Airbus A300 tail and rudder inspections ordered by aviation regulators after the crash last week and found no safety problems. The order to inspect the tail area and certain rudder parts also included Airbus aircraft operated by United Parcel Service Inc. and the FedEx Corporation. Both companies said today that they were making good progress on the checks, and had turned up no safety problems.</p> <p>Marion Blakey, the chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, also said that a complete review of the cockpit voice recorder had turned up no evidence of foul play or sabotage.</p>
1507151>Study Suggests Space Agency Should Consider Mimicking Navy&#39;s Safety Techniques A NASA study of how the Navy operates nuclear submarines has found sharp differences between the Navy and the space agency, with some lessons for safety and reliability that NASA could adopt and some that may be out of its reach. NASA undertook the study last year, partly at the urging of its administrator, Sean O&#39;Keefe, who is a former secretary of the Navy. The comparison of management procedures received new impetus with the Columbia accident on Feb. 1. The independent board appointed to investigate the accident is heavy with Navy members and Navy consultants, and the draft of its final report compares NASA to &#39;&#39;high reliability organizations&#39;&#39; like the Navy, according to people involved in writing it.  <p>The NASA management study, the final part of which was released last week, suggests that the Navy has a &#39;&#39;robust independent audit capability&#39;&#39; and that NASA needs one.</p> <p>Walter H. Cantrell, a retired rear admiral who helped arrange the NASA study of the Navy, is co-chairman of a task force that will review the agency&#39;s return to flight preparations. Mr. Cantrell said in a telephone interview that it was important to separate safety considerations from other issues.</p> <p>At NASA, he said, having no independent review of problems allows the possibility of a program manager &#39;&#39;tailoring safety technical requirements to meet schedule and cost requirements.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Making a decision about the importance of foam shedding, which had been discussed many times before the Columbia launching, was an example, he said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;One could reasonably expect that if this problem had been given to an independent technical authority, they may not have proceeded until they solved that technical problem,&#39;&#39; Mr. Cantrell said. An independent review, he added, could have found that pieces of foam big enough to damage the tiles would do serious damage to the leading-edge panels, as they did to the Columbia.</p> <p>In its report, NASA describes contrasts between the Navy&#39;s operations and its own. Some of them seem stark after the Columbia disaster.</p> <p>For example, the report often refers to the Navy&#39;s &#39;&#39;closed loop&#39;&#39; system, in which any time a problem is identified, corrective action must be found and taken. The immediate cause of the breakup of the Columbia, foam falling from the external tank, had been recognized as a problem years earlier but was still an open issue at the time of the Columbia launching.</p> <p>Navy members of the research team said the Navy&#39;s nuclear submarine program had no specific safety organization; instead, safety is considered to be integral to each person&#39;s job. In contrast, in reaction to the loss of the Columbia, NASA is setting up an additional safety organization.</p> <p>The study also notes that within the Naval Reactors program, &#39;&#39;freedom to dissent is a primary element.&#39;&#39; For NASA, one of the biggest blows after the Columbia accident was the finding that four people or groups had discussed calling for outside help on determining the condition of the Columbia&#39;s thermal protection system after the launching, but that the mission managers had decided against it. Some of the engineers who raised concerns, it became apparent, were reluctant to voice them forcefully enough.</p> <p>The study said NASA&#39;s &#39;&#39;flight readiness review&#39;&#39; system &#39;&#39;can be an intimidating venue in which to raise a technical issue not fully supported with data.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>While many of the organizational differences could be reduced by NASA policy, the space agency is apparently unable to change other elements.</p> <p>For example, the report, called a &#39;&#39;benchmarking study,&#39;&#39; notes that &#39;&#39;knowledge and operational skill degrade when not periodically recalled or used.&#39;&#39; The Navy has more than 100 reactors and thus has ample opportunities for technicians, engineers and others to maintain proficiency. But when NASA had four shuttles, some technicians told investigators that there were tasks that they performed only a few times a year, and that they were concerned about becoming rusty.</p> <p>Now NASA is down to three shuttles.</p> <p>Another difference is the degree of involvement of top management in day-to-day decisions. The Navy conducts most communications by letter, and copies of each letter go to the admiral in charge of the submarine program. That officer has a tenure of eight years.</p> <p>By contrast, only one NASA administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, has that kind of longevity. He served from 1992 until 2001. Four or five years is more typical.</p> <p>The administrator serves at the pleasure of the president, and so the job often changes hands when the White House does. The current administrator, Mr. O&#39;Keefe, has shown himself in Congressional testimony to be sometimes unaware of details of the shuttle program.</p> <p>The report said NASA had adopted some of the Navy strengths. For example, the Navy traces some of its operating success to having a very small, stable group of contractors. NASA maneuvered its two largest shuttle contractors into a partial merger a few years ago in an effort to improve reliability and safety.</p> <p>The NASA contracts, however, include bonuses for on-time launchings, a factor that some outside safety critics say raises the possibility of conflict of interest for contractors who must decide which potential problems to bring to NASA&#39;s attention. The Naval Reactors program points out that Navy contracts have no such provisions.</p>
1521006>Indian Point Security Test Is Called Too Easy A mock attack to test security at the Indian Point nuclear plant this summer used too few attackers and assumed they would not have access to some commercially available weapons, according to a nonprofit group here that has reported extensively on reactor security. The group, the Project on Government Oversight, also complained in a letter to the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that three drills were held at Indian Point, in Westchester County, but all were during the day, which was described as an unlikely time for terrorists to attack.  <p>In two of the drills, the letter said, &#39;&#39;the mock terrorists crossed open fields in broad daylight in order to reach the protected area, making it that much easier for them to be observed by the security officers.&#39;&#39; And the drill was announced in advance, the letter complained.</p> <p>But commission officials said that they could not respond in detail to many of the points in the letter without compromising security.</p> <p>Roy P. Zimmerman, the director of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#39;s office of nuclear security and incident response, said the agency would not talk about &#39;&#39;anything that would give a sense of what the security guards at the plant need to protect against.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The commission said that Indian Point had passed the test, which began at the end of July and ran for several days.</p> <p>A member of the commission, Edward McGaffigan Jr., said that one purpose of the drill was to test Indian Point, but that another was to see if the drills themselves could be improved. The commission would consider nighttime drills, he said, but safety was the first priority. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, he said, &#39;&#39;doesn&#39;t like us having a bunch of people with broken ankles.&#39;&#39; And the mock adversaries did not want to surprise unsuspecting guards, who were armed with rifles, he said.</p> <p>Mr. McGaffigan praised the operators of Indian Point for volunteering for the drill, and said the defenders had performed well in the tests. &#39;&#39;Indian Point is our star; it did famously,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Early this year, the commission ordered the resumption of the drills, known as force-on-force tests, which had been suspended after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and rewrote a document that defines a design basis threat. It lists the number of potential attackers, their skills and the equipment that nuclear plants must defend against.</p> <p>But the letter from the Project on Government Oversight, which was prepared in part by Peter Stockton, a senior investigator with the group and a former security adviser to the federal energy secretary, complained that the new design basis threat involved a small number of attackers, &#39;&#39;barely above the much-ridiculed earlier N.R.C. design basis threat of three attackers.&#39;&#39; He said that when the Army plans for attacks against a target it is defending, it assumes there will be 12 attackers; the Navy assumes there will be 14.</p> <p>In addition, according to the letter, the drills did not take account of adversaries carrying easily available weapons like .50-caliber sniper rifles with armor-piercing incendiary rounds, or rocket-propelled grenades, which are illegal in the United States but widely available outside the country. Commission officials said they could not confirm or deny what was in the design basis threat.</p> <p>Mr. McGaffigan said that there were limits to the armaments that private security forces should be allowed to have. &#39;&#39;You can have diving commercial airliners in the design basis threat, but you can&#39;t give surface-to-air missiles to the guards,&#39;&#39; he said. The purpose of the defenses, commission officials stressed, was to hold off the attackers until the state police and other authorities arrived.</p> <p>The letter from the watchdog group took issue with a letter sent by the commission in August to Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York and others that said that Indian Point had a strong defensive capability. In a telephone interview today, Mr. Schumer said that he was disappointed in the test.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Any test that doesn&#39;t rely on the elements of surprise is completely suspect, and I wish they&#39;d do another one,&#39;&#39; he said. Referring to the Project on Government Oversight&#39;s letter, he said, &#39;&#39;I agree with the thrust of the letter.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They should check the worst-case scenario, not the best-case scenario,&#39;&#39; he said.</p>
577674>Cincinnati Utility to Merge With Indiana Counterpart Citing changes in the electric business brought on by the new Federal energy act, the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company and the parent company of the Public Service Company of Indiana announced yesterday that they planned to merge next year. The new entity, the Cinergy Corporation, will be the nation&#39;s 13th-largest investor-owned utility as measured by generating capacity.  <p>The chief executives of the two companies said their goal was to lower costs by combined operations and to compete better in wholesale electricity sales by merging their transmission systems.  Potential for Growth</p> <p>In addition, PSI Resources, the Indiana company, will get a strong financial partner for the $1.2 billion construction program it must undertake to comply with the Clean Air Act, and Cincinnati Gas will incorporate a service territory that unlike its own still shows strong growth potential.</p> <p>Combining operations is expected to save the companies $750 million over the next 10 years. Their first-year combined revenues are estimated at $2.6 billion.</p> <p>Cincinnati Gas employs 5,000 people and PSI 4,200. The companies say they will trim 400, beginning with hiring freezes and attrition and then early retirement programs, and possibly proceeding to layoffs.</p> <p>James E. Rogers Jr., the chairman, president and chief executive of PSI, said the merger was prompted in part by the energy legislation signed by President Bush in October. The new law is expected to make the wholesale market more competitive by opening access to utility-owned transmission systems and by allowing more players in the market.</p> <p>&quot;From a strategic standpoint, we see change starting to sweep through our industry, eventually resulting in fundamental transformation,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Cinergy will be headed by Jackson H. Randolph, 62, the president and chief executive of Cincinnati Gas, who will be chairman and chief executive until Dec. 1, 1995, when Mr. Rogers, who is 45, will become chief executive. Mr. Randolph is to retire as chairman on Dec. 1, 2000.  Allocation of Shares</p> <p>Under the agreement, endorsed by both boards, shareholders in Cincinnati Gas will get shares in the new entity on a one-for-one basis, and shareholders in PSI will get 0.909 new share for each current share.</p> <p>Cincinnati Gas shares closed yesterday at $23.75, down 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange, and PSI shares closed at $19.125, up 62.5 cents.</p> <p>The merger will require the approval of the two companies&#39; shareholders, state regulators in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The companies said they hoped to conclude the deal by the first quarter of 1994.</p> <p>In a telephone news conference, the two chief executives said the merger was unusual because neither company was in financial trouble. At Prudential Securities, Barry M. Abramson, a stock analyst, agreed. &quot;Neither of these two companies would have been on my list of the 10 most likely to merge,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But he added that the two fitted together in several ways. Cincinnati has an urban service area with residential and commercial customers while PSI serves rural areas and industry, he said. In addition, PSI&#39;s generators are almost all &quot;base load&quot; units, which run continuously, while Cincinnati has generating stations designed to be turned on and off as demand rises and falls.</p> <p>After the merger, Mr. Abramson said, PSI will be able to spin off some of its generating capacity for long-term power sales to other companies. And with a combined transmission system, he said, the companies will be more able to send the power where it will fetch a higher price, generally the East Coast.</p> <p>Mr. Rogers, long an advocate of more open access to the transmission grid, said that the combined entity would have 14 interconnections to other utilities, more than any of its neighbors except American Electric Power.</p> <p>COMPANY NEWS</p>
338345>With Bulbs, Light and Price Are the Key Considerations Consumers who think they can spot the bargains and the pitfalls in the supermarket aisles should pay close attention in the light bulb section, a part of the store where choices are multiplying, where common terms don&#39;t mean what people think they do, and the important measure, light, is almost always overlooked.  <p>* Which gives more light for a given amount of electricity, a &#39;&#39;miser&#39;&#39; 55-watt bulb or a regular 60-watt bulb? Either. They are virtually equal.</p> <p>* Which gives more light, two 60-watt bulbs or one 100-watt bulb? Either. They are about equal, too.</p> <p>* Can you save money by paying extra for a long-life bulb, which is advertised as lasting twice as long as the regular bulb? Generally no. The long-life bulb generally has a higher purchase price per hour of service, and it gives off less light than a standard bulb of equal wattage.</p> <p>As is common in supermarkets, a pocket calculator is the surest way to evaluate the choices.</p> <p>Bulbs are sold by wattage, but a watt is not a measure of light. It is a measure of energy consumed; in this case, of how much electricity the bulb uses. A second figure on the box, lumens, tells how much light the bulb gives off.</p> <p>Some stores sell a 55-watt bulb meant to be a substitute for a standard 60-watt bulb. This is the first opportunity to misunderstand what is offered.</p> <p>The packaging that suggests the 55-watt model as a replacement for the 60, and the price, which is sometimes higher, could lead a buyer to conclude that the 55-watt bulb gives off the same amount of light, although it uses 8.3 percent less electricity. In fact, the 60-watt bulb gives off 870 lumens and the 55-watt model, 810 lumens, or about 6.9 percent less light, with a small gain in efficiency.</p> <p>Not All Bulbs Are the Same</p> <p>At the national average price of electricity, the 55-watt bulb would use about 30 cents less power over its lifetime. This saving could easily be outweighed by the higher price.</p> <p>That is not to say that all bulbs are the same. They do vary in number of lumens delivered per watt of energy supplied, an efficiency measure similar to miles per gallon for a car. Generally, the larger bulbs are more efficient. So a 100-watt bulb typically delivers 1,750 lumens, which is just slightly more than two 60-watt bulbs.</p> <p>A questionable economy is bulbs that are supposed to last longer. Figures will vary with wattage and brand. A standard 60-watt bulb might be advertised as lasting 1,000 hours, and a long-life bulb, 1,500 hours. At $1.75 each, the long-life bulb costs 12 one-hundredths of a cent per hour of service life. At 95 cents each, the standard bulb costs 10 one-hundredths of a cent per hour. And the standard bulb gives off 14.5 lumens per watt; the long-life bulb, 13.7. Still, the long-life bulb is a good choice if it is going into the ceiling fixture of your two-story entryway.</p> <p>Far more efficient bulbs are available. Halogen bulbs, for example, deliver almost 20 lumens per watt, or one-fourth more light for the same amount of electricity. And fluorescents deliver 40 to 80 lumens per watt, or 2 1/2 to 5 times as much light per unit of electricity. Several manufacturers now make fluorescents that screw into a standard incandescent base, and these are available in hardware stores and home centers.</p> <p>How important is efficiency in a light bulb? In commercial buildings, where lights are usually on all day, lighting efficiency is becoming a major consideration. For homes, the value depends on the use of the bulb. For example, a homeowner who substituted a 100-watt bulb for two 60-watt bulbs would be saving 20 watts. If the light burns for 6 hours a night, a customer in New York City and Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties would save about $6 a year in electricity. At the national average price for electricity, the figure would be closer to $4.</p> <p>That is a very modest difference. But in other applications, the choice is more important. For example, a consumer who keeps a 60-watt light burning 12 hours a day in a hallway or bathroom spends about $21 a year, at the average electricity price. A screw-in fluorescent would have an operating cost of only about $6.</p> <p>The fluorescents sell for $20 to $30, depending on model, but they typically last for 10,000 hours, compared with 1,000 hours for the standard incandescent. Over the 10,000-hour lifetime, at the average electricity price, the fluorescent bulb would save the consumer about $34 in operating costs, and because it would outlive about 10 incandescents, it would save, at minimum, another $10.</p> <p>But earning the savings would take the bulb its entire lifetime. That means that the usefulness of a better bulb depends on what it is being used for.</p> <p>Is It Worth the Price?</p> <p>In a 24-hour-a-day application, achieving the entire savings would take 14 months, making the initial investment attractive. But in a spare bedroom used only a few times a year, it could take decades, and the consumer would be better off buying a cheaper incandescent.</p> <p>In addition, fluorescents will not fit all fixtures and cannot be used outdoors.</p> <p>For consumers who take the broadest view, there are other more cosmic considerations, not just the cost of electricity. Substituting a more efficient bulb can reduce the amount of coal or oil burned. And the less coal burned, the less acid rain; the less oil used, the lower the trade deficit.</p> <p>CONSUMER&#39;S WORLD</p>
584663>Two Scientists Find a Way To Make Cheaper Methanol A team of chemists in California has discovered what appears to be a cheaper way to turn natural gas into methanol. If it can be commercialized, the process could create vast supplies of transportation fuel from reserves of gas that cannot now be tapped economically. The process is described in the current issue of the journal Science by seven scientists from Catalytica Inc., a company in Mountain View, Calif.  <p>Natural gas is composed primarily of methane, a molecule with a carbon atom at its center and four hydrogen atoms attached. It can be converted to methanol, a liquid, by tearing off one of the hydrogen atoms and replacing it with two atoms that are bonded together, one of oxygen and one of hydrogen. But the process is difficult and expensive because in methane the bond between the carbon atom and the hydrogen atoms is very strong.</p> <p>The use of methanol in vehicles is increasing in this country because it creates fewer of the pollutants that cause smog, although it produces other forms of pollution. Burning it in automobiles requires modified fuel pumps, seals and lubricants, but those technical challenges have already been overcome. A Mix With Gasoline</p> <p>It can also be used as a raw material to make methyl tertiary butyl ether, which can be mixed with gasoline in conventional cars.</p> <p>By 1994 the capacity to produce methanol will be three times what it was at the beginning of last year, according to David A. Zinamon, a fuels expert at Petroleum Industry Research Associates, a consulting firm in New York.</p> <p>The world market for methanol could become tight in the middle of this decade, he said, and a new technology would be useful in meeting new demand, although world use of methanol is not expected to increase greatly. Methanol cannot compete with gasoline on the basis of price in this country; a gallon of gasoline sells at wholesale, before taxes, at 50 cents, but a quantity of methanol that delivers the same amount of energy costs 80 cents, Mr. Zinamon said.</p> <p>Natural gas reserves nearly equal oil reserves in energy value. But bringing natural gas to market would require huge capital investments. The North Slope of Alaska, for example, has substantial gas reserves, but there is no pipeline to the lower 48 states, and the price of liquefying the gas for tanker shipment is far too high to be justified under current market conditions. Use of Catalyst</p> <p>The new system uses a catalyst, a material that speeds up a chemical reaction but is not consumed by it. In this case, a form of mercury with an electric charge is used.</p> <p>&quot;You can buy this off the shelf,&quot; Roy A. Periana, the project leader at Catalytica, said in a telephone interview. &quot;Any chemist can do this reaction.&quot;</p> <p>At one point in the process the reaction produces sulfuric acid, and at another it makes sulfur dioxide, but both those chemicals are consumed in later steps. The process occurs at temperatures far lower than conventional methods for making methanol.</p> <p>But another researcher, Professor John J. Thomas of the Florida Institute of Technology, warned that the need for acid-resistant containers could drive costs up. In addition, he said, even when a process has been demonstrated on a laboratory scale, substantial engineering work is needed before a pilot plant can be built. &quot;Those two things kill a lot of processes,&quot; he said.</p> <p>In the Catalytica process, the ingredients required are methane and oxygen from air; at the end it yields methanol, along with carbon dioxide.</p> <p>Dr. Periana said that so far chemists had carried on the process in liter quantities.</p> <p>&quot;We would not want to represent that it&#39;s ready for commercialization, but it is a significant improvement in science, a breakthrough,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Catalytica has filed documents in preparation for a public sale of stock, and Dr. Periana said that as a result he could not discuss the commercial possibilities in detail.</p> <p>The research was financed by Petro Canada and Mitsubishi Oil, he said.</p> <p>Correction:  January 24, 1993, Sunday</p> <p>An article last Sunday about a new process for converting natural gas to methanol misidentified a chemical. From 1992 to 1994 the United States is expected to triple its capacity to make methyl tertiary butyl ether, which is derived from methanol, not to triple the capacity to make methanol itself.</p>
1539409>Rochester Utility Sells Nuclear Power Station A Baltimore-based electric company said Tuesday that it would buy the Robert E. Ginna nuclear plant from Rochester Gas and Electric for $401 million. The deal struck by Constellation Energy is notable because the price is nearly 50 percent higher, per watt of capacity, than it agreed to pay for the nearby Nine Mile Point reactors three years ago. It is also noteworthy because of the advanced age of Ginna, which entered service in July 1970 and is running on a license that expires in six years. The deal is contingent on winning a 20-year license extension from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  <p>The Ginna plant is about 20 miles north of Rochester, in Oswego, on the shore of Lake Ontario.</p> <p>Of the five other reactors in New York State, two have already been bought by Constellation and three by another national nuclear operator, Entergy.</p> <p>Mayo A. Shattuck III, the chairman, president and chief executive of Constellation, said that one reason his company saw value in the plant was the expectation of high power prices in New York. Constellation will sell 90 percent of the output to Rochester Gas and Electric for the first 10 years, at an average price of $44 a megawatt-hour, he said, and expected to make a profit on that and on the remaining 10 percent, because of the way that &#39;&#39;the New York region is likely to evolve,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Rochester Gas and Electric is a subsidiary of the Energy East Corporation of Ithaca, N.Y.</p> <p>Michael J. Wallace, the president of the Constellation Generation Group, a subsidiary of Constellation Energy, said that market prices today in New York were &#39;&#39; quite a bit higher than they were three years ago.&#39;&#39; Constellation, in addition, has signed numerous contracts to supply power in New York and New England.</p> <p>Mr. Wallace said that the 20-year license extension was nearly certain and that &#39;&#39;it&#39;s a slam-dunk till 2029 -- the question is how many years beyond.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In 1982, Ginna experienced a rupture in a steam generator tube; a similar rupture occurred at Indian Point 2 in 2000. Ginna replaced its steam generators in 1996. Ginna has also replaced numerous parts that have caused problems at other plants including pumps and valves, and the vessel head.</p> <p>In addition, the political climate seems favorable, said Paul J. Allen, vice president for corporate affairs. &#39;&#39;There is a high understanding of the safety and security of the plants and a lot of public acceptance,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Constellation is counting on increasing the power output of the plant by about 17 percent. Crucial components of the plant replaced in the 1990&#39;s were sized to allow more heat production in the reactor and more electricity production from the generator. The plant was rated at 470 megawatts when it entered service, is now listed at 495 megawatts and is seeking permission to go to 580.</p> <p>If it succeeds in increasing the plant&#39;s power output, Constellation will be paying about $667 per kilowatt of capacity. A kilowatt is about enough energy to run a single window air-conditioner. Consumers buy electricity by the kilowatt-hour, so a kilowatt-hour is what is required to run a typical air-conditioner for an hour. Constellation paid $415 for each kilowatt of capacity at Nine Mile, which is about 50 miles to the west, also on the shore of Lake Ontario. The two plants can share some resources, company officials said.</p> <p>Correction:  December 1, 2003, Monday  An article in Business Day on Wednesday about the sale of the Robert E. Ginna nuclear plant by Rochester Gas and Electric misstated its location. It is in Ontario, N.Y., not Oswego.</p>
391348>Oil Down $1.71 After Big Swings Oil prices fell yesterday after bouncing up and down on war worries and then on rumors that Saddam Hussein had been assassinated.  <p>In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a barrel of crude for delivery next month closed at $38.69, down $1.71 from Tuesday&#39;s record high of $40.40. In the course of a wild day, prices reached $41.15 and then fell back to $38.</p> <p>The gyrations were felt in the stock market, but for a change stocks moved in the same direction as oil prices, with the Dow off 37.62, at 2,407.92, after fluctuating wildly. [Page D10.]  Refined products fell even more sharply than crude oil; heating oil closed at $1.0105, down 5.10 cents, the equivalent of $2.14 a barrel. Unleaded gasoline fell to 93.60 cents a gallon, or 4.66 cents, the equivalent of $1.96 a barrel.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The markets were kind of manic-depressive,&#39;&#39; said James Fielder, a trader at E.D.&amp; F. Man International. &#39;&#39;As long as the situation in the Persian Gulf is not resolved, it&#39;s going to stay volatile like this, and you might as well get used to it.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Fielder described a market torn between two magnets: a war price of $60 a barrel and a supply-and-demand price of $20 a barrel, with occasional panicky lunges toward one or the other.</p> <p>At Cargill Investor Services, Howard P. Rennell, a trader, said that heating oil had led the plunge in crude. &#39;&#39;The market was getting overbought before the Palestinian situation hit the news,&#39;&#39; he said, referring to the riot in Jerusalem on Monday in which at least 19 Palestinians were killed. &#39;&#39;People have gone into the heating oil market with the expectation of December&#39;s being as bitter cold as it was last year, and a war, combining the two worst-case scenarios.&#39;&#39; In addition, he pointed out, inventories are high.</p> <p>After the market closed, the American Petroleum Institute, the industry&#39;s main trade association, released its weekly survey, showing that inventories are still strong, although slightly lower in some categories.</p> <p>A View From Canada</p> <p>Most experts see volatility ahead. At the Canadian Energy Research Institute, in Calgary, Alberta, Dr. Gerry Angevine, the chairman, said: &#39;&#39;If the price falls to $30, all Saddam Hussein has to do is make a statement and the price will go up. And I would think that from where he sits, he wants to see the price stay high. He&#39;d like to see his enemies pay as high a price as possible.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;On any one day, we could continue to see swings of 10 percent or more,&#39;&#39; Dr. Angevine said. The range today, $3.15, was about 8 percent, larger than average but not the largest in the 11 weeks since Iraq invaded Kuwait, a period in which the price of oil has more than doubled.</p> <p>Since then, resentment against the oil industry and the futures market has grown. In Washington yesterday, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman complained in a speech on the Senate floor of &#39;&#39;a feeding frenzy in oil futures.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Senator Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said &#39;&#39;speculators on the futures market often trade up prices on the basis of hysteria, not rational projections of future economic factors.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Rumors fly at the speed of sound, and prices rise or fall in quick consequence,&#39;&#39; Mr. Lieberman said. &#39;&#39;It makes little difference whether those rumors are true or false.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Others argue, however, that the futures market is doing its job of determining a price, one that is now heavily influenced by uncertainty.</p> <p>John H. Lichtblau, the head of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York, said, &#39;&#39;the great bulk of these transactions are for the purpose of hedging, not speculation.&#39;&#39; For example, he said, a company that pumps oil from the ground might buy a contract to sell oil next month at $40, to protect itself against the risk that a resolution to the crisis would cut world oil prices and make the company&#39;s output worth less.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s really risk insurance,&#39;&#39; Mr. Lichtblau said. And if rumors drive prices up, they also drive prices down, he said, adding that for every winner on the market there is a loser.</p>
94591>Turning Point Nears In Production of Fuel For Hydrogen Bombs WITH aging, faltering plants its sole source of supply, the Federal Government must soon decide whether to build expensive new facilities to produce tritium, a vital and perishable ingredient of nuclear bombs.  <p>The poor condition of the production reactors - two are broken down and the other three are limited to half power - makes possible an interruption in supply. Such a halt would leave nuclear warheads losing potency in their silos, as batteries lose their charge on a supermarket shelf. Adding to the sense of urgency, a recent study by the National Academy of Sciences said that it may take as long to build a new production reactor as the surviving three will last.</p> <p>The Department of Energy is expected to seek funds soon to build one or two new reactors to produce tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, and plutonium, another bomb fuel produced in the same reactors. But each new plant would cost billions, and some experts question whether they are necessary.</p> <p>The Department is expected to argue that the expense is required for national security. But some arms control advocates, joined by environmentalists who say that production of these bomb fuels is dangerous and polluting, argue that an agreement with the Soviet Union to limit nuclear arms could render the investment unnecessary.</p> <p>Even limited arms reductions, such as those in the treaty on nuclear forces in Europe now under negotiation, could reduce the need for fresh tritium since supplies could be scavenged from disassembled weapons, some experts say.</p> <p>Some experts even suggest that by halting tritium production, the East and West could achieve disarmament. With no new supplies, the argument goes, nations would have to steadily reduce arsenals to keep potent tritium in the remaining weapons.</p> <p>While plutonium production is required to expand the nuclear arsenal, tritium production is needed simply to maintain existing weapons. This is because tritium breaks down naturally at the rate of about 5.5 percent per year. Plutonium, in contrast, is eternal, at least on the human timescale, and the nation&#39;s stockpile is believed to be substantial.</p> <p>Thus tritium, even more than plutonium, is becoming the focus of concern in Congress, which will have to decide on Administration proposals to build the costly new plants.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s very clear that tritium is the main event, rather than plutonium,&#39;&#39; said Rep. Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. His district is downstream along the Columbia River from the Federal Government&#39;s plutonium-producing reactor at Hanford, Wash., which is closed for safety improvements.</p> <p>Tritium has become increasingly important to the nuclear arsenal. As a &#39;&#39;booster&#39;&#39; in the trigger portion of a hydrogen bomb, tritium is essential to reducing the size of warheads, allowing more warheads per missile, or warheads on smaller missiles.</p> <p>Tritium is a variant or isotope of hydrogen. In nature, the commmon form of the hydrogen atom has a nucleus of a single proton. A naturally occurring isotope is deuterium. Each deuterium nucleus contains one proton and one neutron; one in 6,000 hydrogen atoms is deuterium.</p> <p>Tritium, the third isotope, has a nucleus with one proton and two neutrons. It does not occur naturally; it is made in reactors by firing a neutron at the nucleus of lithium-6, which consists of three protons and three neutrons. When a neutron is added, the atom throws off two neutrons and two protons. This leaves one proton and two neutrons, which is tritium.</p> <p>The three active tritium-producing reactors are all at least 30 years old and all at the Energy Department&#39;s Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C. These can also produce plutonium. Environmentalists and worker-safety advocates have argued that plant wastes, which are toxic as well as radioactive, are poorly handled. Recently, the Energy Department has acknowledged some problems.</p> <p>Adding to the worries, E. I. du Pont De Nemours &amp; Company, which built and operates the plants under contract, recently announced that it would give up the work. No replacement has been announced.</p> <p>The newest production reactor, a plutonium-producing reactor at the Hanford nuclear reservation in southeastern Washington, commissioned by President Kennedy in 1963 and intended to run for 20 years, was used briefly a few years ago to make tritium, with disappointing results. The reactor has been closed since the beginning of the year for safety improvements.</p> <p>The General Accounting Office reported in March that the situation at Savannah River, coupled with uncertainties about the future operation of the reactor at Hanford, &#39;&#39;raises questions about DOE&#39;s ability to meet production requirements.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A recent report by the National Academy of Sciences drew attention to the fragile status of tritium production capacity as well as the safety concerns raised by plants used to produce tritium and plutonium. The Energy Department is planning to respond to the report by the end of the year, and its response will discuss plans for one or two new production reactors for making the two bomb fuels, according to a spokeswoman, Chris Sankey. Roles for Tritium</p> <p>Tritium has two roles in nuclear weapons: in the fusion that causes the main explosion and, in the latest weapons, in the fission trigger.</p> <p>In the fusion of a hydrogen bomb, an atom of deuterium and an atom of tritium are forced together under extremely high heat provided by a fission trigger. Bombs are designed to produce the tritium for this stage internally, using neutrons from the fission trigger, in a process much like that in a reactor.</p> <p>But tritium must be supplied for use as the booster in the bomb trigger, where its function is to rapidly multiply the number of neutrons, subatomic particles that sustain a fission reaction.</p> <p>Fission, the splitting of atoms in a chain reaction, is the process that powers civilian power reactors as well as bombs like those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p> <p>In a simple chain reaction, as in a civilian power reactor, a neutron is fired at the nucleus of a uranium atom, splitting it. The split nucleus releases energy and a small number of neutrons. Some are absorbed by non-fissionable material. In a power reactor at equilibrium, each split nucleus gives off, on average, one neutron that later splits another nucleus. Doubling the Nucleii</p> <p>When a fission trigger is fueled by uranium or plutonium, enough neutrons are freed in each generation of fissioning to double the number of nucleii split in the next generation; in microseconds, one fissioning produces two more fissions, which produce four, then eight and so on.</p> <p>But this process can only occur when there are enough atoms compressed in a &#39;&#39;critical mass&#39;&#39; of fuel. Usually, chemical explosives are used to get this process started. But as fission progresses, the critical mass tends to blow apart, stopping the process. Theodore B. Taylor, a weapons designer at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1950&#39;s and now a private consultant, said some bombs would fission no more than one-half of 1 percent of the available fuel before exploding.</p> <p>This is where tritium comes in. When tritium and deuterium fuse, they emit a neutron whose energy is much higher than those emitted in fission. Each high energy neutron, when it strikes another nucleus, produces four, not two, neutrons. So the &#39;&#39;fission&#39;&#39; trigger that incorporates the fusion of tiny amounts of deuterium and tritium produces the same power from much less fuel.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If the boosting starts early enough in the fission chain reaction, then it releases a lot of neutrons at a time when the chain reaction is multiplying the neutron population very rapidly,&#39;&#39; Mr. Taylor said. &#39;&#39;A neutron injected at that time is worth more than one fission; it is worth easily 10 times as many fissions.&#39;&#39; Role in Neutron Bombs</p> <p>Tritium is also used in the production of neutron bombs, weapons intended to kill people with radiation rather than destroy targets with shock wave. In such a bomb, tritium helps produce a greater number of neutrons from the same amount of plutonium. The Government has apparently dropped plans to produce large numbers of neutron bombs.</p> <p>The volume of tritium used in triggers is probably small. The Nuclear Weapons Databook, a 1987 publication of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental group, estimated the Energy Department tritium inventory at 86 kilograms; with about 25,000 warheads, that means less than four grams per warhead.</p> <p>Since the bombs are not refueled daily, their tritium reservoirs must have a surplus built in to allow for natural decay. In addition, the Energy Department has a central stockpile, which itself is disappearing at the rate of 5.5 percent a year. Tritium decays into a form of helium. How often the bombs must be re-charged, and how long the stockpile would suffice before the arsenal began to degrade, are classified information, according to the spokeswoman for the Energy Department, Ms. Sankey. Maintaining the Stockpile</p> <p>David Albright, senior staff scientist of the Federation of American Scientists, an arms-control group, said that without a negotiated arms reduction, maintaining the nuclear stockpile would require about 10 kilograms of tritium per year. Mr. Albright&#39;s estimate is part of an article he is preparing with Mr. Taylor for the January issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on the subject of nuclear materials production.</p> <p>Mr. Taylor, the former weapons designer, said it would take some time without new tritium before weapons were significantly weakened.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I find it hard to believe there would be a dramatic change in yields if none of them were re-supplied for three or four years,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s not to say that some people would not feel nervous about it, but the nervousness starts from a fairly high level of confidence.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Another nonprofit group in Washington concerned with nuclear disarmament, the Nuclear Control Institute, proposed earlier this year using the decay of tritium as a tool for mutual disarmament.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Both superpowers are now faced with the same choice: to maintain and modernize their aging and unsafe nuclear-weapons production reactors if the nuclear arms race continues, or to shut down these dangerous facilities if both sides can agree on verifiable reductions in the numbers and types of nuclear weapons that will make further production of weapons materials unnecessary for the foreseeable future,&#39;&#39; the institute said. Monitoring at Issue</p> <p>Others argue that disarmament through tritium decay would not be as effective as a ban on plutonium and weapons-grade uranium production, in part because it is easier to monitor those metals.</p> <p>Thomas B. Cochran, senior staff scientist of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a telephone interview that &#39;&#39;it would be very difficult to retire warheads, even in an optimistic arms control scenario, at a rate in excess of tritium decay.&#39;&#39; With about 25,000 warheads in the nation&#39;s stockpile, he said, matching tritium decay would require eliminating 1,250 warheads the first year. In contrast, the recent negotiations with the Soviet Union on intermediate-range nuclear forces call for a reduction of 500 weapons over five years.</p> <p>However, he added, if plutonium production is frozen and the three surviving reactors were needed only for tritium, they might survive longer with a reduced workload.</p>
322335>Shoreham Asset: Land and Location THE Herculean labor involved in building the Shoreham nuclear-power plant may have been largely a waste, but a group of energy experts in Midland, Mich., hopes to convince Long Islanders not to overlook the value of an indestructible component: the land on which the plant sits.  <p>Never mind the $5 billion reactor, they say. Instead, think of Shoreham as a large piece of land already connected to the power grid, and with a source for cooling water and a clutch of permits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere in New York.</p> <p>The entrepreneurs are the developers of the Midland Cogeneration Venture, a failed nuclear project that is being repowered with natural gas to supply electricity and industrial steam, a process called cogeneration.</p> <p>The project, 110 miles north of Detroit, is scheduled to complete a 23-month metamorphosis next month. About the time it enters into commercial operation, its builders, led by CMS, the corporate parent of the utility that built the Midland reactor, will probably be starting a campaign to persuade Long Island to let them do the same with Shoreham.</p> <p>Siting of New Lines a Problem</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Siting new transmission lines is an abomination,&#39;&#39; William T. McCormick Jr., chairman of CMS, told a group of visitors from Long Island earlier this month.</p> <p>Making use of existing permits for water use, and of the decision more than 20 years ago to use the site for power generation, will save years in building another plant, he said.</p> <p>Matthew C. Cordaro of Long Lake Energy agreed. Said Mr. Cordaro, a former vice president of the Long Island Lighting Company, whose company hopes to participate in a conversion:</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know where you could site a generating plant in Nassau County or western Suffolk.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Lilco itself, however, is unenthusiastic. One reason is that conversion of Shoreham by third parties like the Long Island Power Authority and the Michigan utility would turn Lilco into an electricity buyer and reseller, rather than a producer and seller.</p> <p>Intense Sales Effort</p> <p>CMS put on an intense sales effort for the visitors, members of the Long Island Power Authority. The pitch included a videotape on conversion with a sound track that a CMS official said sounded like &#39;&#39;co-gen Rambo.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>For the Power Authority officials, the trip to Michigan had some coincidences. The chairman, Richard Kessel, told Mr. McCormick over dinner at the Midland Country Club that he also served as chairman of the Consumer Protection Board in New York.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;My job is to kick utilities,&#39;&#39; Mr. Kessel told Mr. McCormick. &#39;&#39;I&#39;m good at it.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Shoreham is so unpopular, he said, that a converted project would probably have to be renamed. He mused about holding a contest to pick a new title.</p> <p>The main source of opposition to a conversion is not likely to be the partisans of another site but rather those who believe that the money needed to build a new plant would be better spent on more efficient light bulbs, refrigerators, electric motors and other consuming equipment.</p> <p>The environmental impact of growth is small if natural gas is the fuel, but it is smaller yet if existing supplies of power are made to do more work at lower cost, efficiency advocates say.</p> <p>The converters, led by CMS, argue that a converted Shoreham is the best option if a power plant is needed. (A Shoreham twin, the Zimmer reactor in Moscow, Ohio, is being converted to coal, and a 15-year-old reactor in Sacramento, Calif., may also be converted to natural gas. But in general, conversion is a strategy born of desperation.) At Midland, CMS&#39;s utility subsidiary, Consumers Power Company, had spent $4.1 billion to bring the twin-reactor project to a point that it said was 85 percent complete.</p> <p>Facing stiff opposition from its customers and the Michigan Attorney General, and engineering problems, including the settling of parts of the plant into mud, Consumers Power stopped work in 1984. When CMS contributed the nonnuclear portion of Midland to the new venture, it valued those assets at $1.5 billion.</p> <p>The conversion was opposed by many of those who fought the nuclear plant, and the power sales contract between the Midland Cogeneration Venture partners, which include CMS, and the CMS subsidiary, Consumers Power, has been the subject of extensive hearings before the Michigan regulatory authorities.</p> <p>Abandonment Called Opportunity</p> <p>But abandonment is an opportunity, Mr. McCormick said, adding that the Shoreham abandonment could transform the energy picture in the New York region in a positive way.</p> <p>In electricity terms, Long Island is the end of the line, an extended finger at the end of the power grid that must fend for itself to a large extent because geography sets limits on imports.</p> <p>But CMS would like to turn Long Island into the beginning of the line, an energy exporter generating enough electricity to provide steady power to Connecticut, New York City and New Jersey. Conceivably, the new transmission line being built under Long Island Sound to bring in power from the north might run in the other direction.</p> <p>One essential reason for a gas-powered plant bigger than the reactor is technical. The part of Shoreham that turns steam into electricity is designed for nuclear steam, which is about 550 degrees.</p> <p>Air Dumped at 1,000 Degrees</p> <p>But when it comes to fossil fuels, the higher the temperature, the higher the efficiency, and natural gas is generally used to produce hot air at 2,000 degrees.</p> <p>Plants that use that air to make electricity dump the air at 1,000 degrees, and that waste energy is still hot enough to make steam that the nuclear turbine can handle after it has had some modifications.</p> <p>But it takes the waste heat of many gas burners to make enough steam to use the nuclear turbine. At Midland, a plant that was to be 800 megawatts will run, in its initial phase, at 1,200. Eventually, the complex, which includes a mothballed turbine from a second reactor, could be used to make 3,500 megawatts.</p> <p>That amount of power is vast by any standard. The largest electric-generating complex in New York, in Scriba, where Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 and the James A. Fitzpatrick reactors are situated, comes to 2,500 megawatts. Shoreham was intended to be an 809-megawatt plant.</p> <p>Even 809 megawatts is more power that Long Island is projected to need in the near future. The settlement under which Shoreham was shut envisioned three 300-megawatt plants going into service in 1997, 1999 and 2001.</p> <p>Demand Rising Steadily</p> <p>But in the Northeast as a whole, a strong economy and a long-term trend toward greater electrification of jobs previously done with fossil fuels are steadily raising demand.</p> <p>New York State&#39;s position is relatively strong, but in the hottest and coldest days each year, the New England utilities have come uncomfortably close to their generating limits.</p> <p>In hot weather, the group of utilities that serves the region from Newark to Washington, D.C. and west to the Allegheny Mountains has had to cut voltage repeatedly.</p> <p>Pennsylvania added a large nuclear reactor, Limerick 2, earlier this year, and New England may add the Seabrook plant, but each of these represents only about one year&#39;s growth. Future growth is likely to be met by smaller gas-fired plants.</p> <p>Does that make an expanded, gas-powered Shoreham a good deal for Long Island?</p> <p>Mr. Kessel pondered that question as he gazed at a row of 12 rust-colored gas-turbine exhaust stacks at Midland, each towering 120 feet over the flat landscape.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I&#39;m trying to place it on Long Island,&#39;&#39; he told James A. Mooney, the CMS official in charge of engineering and construction. &#39;&#39;Does it have to have stacks?&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Well, you could paint them green,&#39;&#39; Mr. Mooney replied.  The stacks also could be partly screened by the hilly terrain at Shoreham, said another CMS official who had scouted the Long Island site.</p> <p>The Swiss-built gas turbines in use at Midland are 87 megawatts each. Probably at least four would be needed before it would be sensible to use the Shoreham turbine.</p> <p>But if the waste heat were used in the turbine, about 43 percent of the energy in the gas would be turned to electricity, which is considered highly efficient. Most oil- and gas-fired plants achieve efficiencies of only about 34 percent.</p> <p>A larger plant would have lower costs per kilowatt-hour produced, say its proponents, and, Mr. Kessel noted, would have a higher assessed valuation for tax purposes.</p> <p>But he and other Power Authority officials expressed leeriness about large projects. He added, given the history of Shoreham, that for a conversion to work, &#39;&#39;This has to be seen as a good deal by Long Island.&#39;&#39;</p>
160829>When Lightning Strikes, Your Gadgets Are at Risk These are the times that try men&#39;s microchips, when overloaded electrical systems fail and are restored with a surge of power, when lightning bolts hit overhead lines and send through thousands of volts.  <p>These occurrences can burn out sensitive electronic components. Among the items at risk are home computers, video cassette recorders, televisions, cable-television boxes, satellite dishes, microwave ovens, burglar-alarm systems, remote-controlled garage-door openers and cordless telephones.</p> <p>The problem is voltage, the measurement of the pressure under which electricity is forced over the power lines. Surges are the opposite of voltage dips, far more common occurrences that can blank a computer screen or wipe out a VCR program, but usually do not hurt hardware.  Appliances Can Be Cooked</p> <p>If the voltage jumps, though, the sudden increase in energy produces heat that can cook a semiconductor. Voltage surges are typically measured in milliseconds - that is, mere thousandths of a second, too quick for a fuse to break a circuit protectively - but the increases can be enormous. Experts say lightning strikes have caused voltage levels as high as 25,000 volts on power lines.</p> <p>Such surges will ruin electronic devices no matter how they are protected. &#39;&#39;When God wants to get that equipment, He&#39;s going to get it,&#39;&#39; said Dick Glass, president of the Electronics Technicians Association International. But Mr. Glass, the proprietor of an electronics repair business in Greencastle, Ind., added, &#39;&#39;Surge protectors are going to help you four times out of five.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A surge protector, also called a surge suppressor, diverts the excess energy to ground. Dozens are on the market, mostly made by small companies, with model names like Surge Sentry, Datashield and Kleen Line. Sales run $150 million to $180 million a year, said Ronald T. Davis, a manager of consumer products planning at General Electric Company. They are widely sold in computer and hardware stores, but with standards and expertise still being developed, buying one can be confusing. Many appliances are built to withstand some degree of surge, but sales people are often not knowledgeable about this.</p> <p>One approach is to buy a whole-house protector, which is installed at the fuse box and is the strongest protection against lightning. Its cost is modest, starting at $30, but it requires a licensed electrician to install it, and there are gaps in its protection.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Whole-house surge protectors are not that effective,&#39;&#39; said John Birchak, a consultant at the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute. The reason, he said, is that many surges are created inside the house, by the motors in washing machines and vacuum cleaners, which create a current in the instant that they are shut off.</p> <p>A more common surge protector, which plugs into the wall and has receptacles for computers and other equipment, guards against in-house surges. Computer stores recommend this kind of protector, although they often do so as an afterthought.</p> <p>Consumers should focus on two specifications of any surge protector: at what voltage it &#39;&#39;clamps down,&#39;&#39; or opens a bypass for excess power, and at what voltage it loses its ability to protect.  Lower Not Always Better</p> <p>In clamping, or diverting, excess voltage, a lower level is not necessarily better, said Francois D. Martzloff, an engineer in the electrosystems division of the National Bureau of Standards, a part of the United States Department of Commerce.</p> <p>The reason, he said, is that small surges are fairly common and harmless. &#39;&#39;Under certain conditions, which occur infrequently but are unavoidable, voltage can rise to 20, 30 or 50 percent over normal,&#39;&#39; which is 110 to 120 volts, he said. Most household electrical equipment can survive such surges without protection. A surge protector that activates on small surges can wear out prematurely, he said. He advises a model that activates at 400 to 500 volts.</p> <p>The other parameter is the highest voltage that the surge protector can suppress. Beware, however; because of evolving standards, the measurement is often stated in a way that is not very useful, in terms of the protection offered at one milliampere, a very small amount of electricity. Dr. Martzloff suggested looking for a model that uses a newer, more effective measurement standard.</p> <p>Underwriters&#39; Laboratories set both the one-milliampere standard, and the newer one that requires the manufacturer to state the device&#39;s voltage limit at 500 amperes, an amount of electricity more typical of a surge. Those with the earlier standard also carry a disclaimer, saying that Underwriters&#39; Laboratories has not tested them.  Phone Lines Vulnerable</p> <p>UL also has a new standard for measuring whole-house surge protectors, with the amperage set at 3,000. Household fuse boxes are generally rated at 100 to 200 amperes.</p> <p>Even the maximum amount of protection won&#39;t guard your equipment against a second route of entry. Many computers are linked to the outside world by telephone lines, and video cassette recorders often have cable connections; both can carry surges.</p> <p>Computer modem surge protectors are available in computer stores, but Dr. Martzloff said a better bet is a unit designed to filter surges from both the power line and the telephone line, or the power line and the television cable.</p> <p>Surge protectors would be easy to build into computers and televisions, said Dr. Ronald B. Standler, a professor of electrical engineering at Pennsylvania State University, but are not likely to be any time soon. Electronic equipment is &#39;&#39;a very price-sensitive market,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;A minuscule change in the cost can, in the eye of corporate executives, blow the whole corporation away,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Whole-house surge protectors are required in some lightning-prone Southern states. Dr. Standler said the idea was twice proposed for inclusion in the Federal electrical code but was defeated by electrical-equipment companies. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s an additional layer of complexity for them,&#39;&#39; he said.  HOW TO KNOW IF YOU NEED PROTECTION</p> <p>Who needs a surge protector?</p> <p>Just about anybody with a computer should consider one. So should people with other sensitive electronic equipment who live in areas prone to flickering lights or blackouts. Surge protection may also be a good idea if lights brighten and dim when refrigerators and washing machines stop and start. How much should it cost? Prices range from $10 to $100 and may not be related to quality. But some higher-priced models have desirable extras, like lights that indicate whether they are working properly and audible signals that warn of low voltage. Bigger models have multiple outlets, but don&#39;t get more than you need for your sensitive equipment. A protector should never do double duty as an extension cord for other electrical equipment.</p> <p>Is there another way to protect equipment?</p> <p>Here&#39;s a low-technology approach: if you happen to be at home when power is lost, unplug sensitive electronic equipment. This is foolproof protection from the surge when power is restored.</p> <p>CONSUMER&#39;S WORLD</p>
784490>Flying Blind -- A special report; Aging Control System Brings Chaos to Air Travel At least 11 times in the last year, air traffic control centers have stumbled or broken down completely, robbing controllers of the tools they use to keep airplanes separated and on course, sometimes leaving them completely deaf, mute and blind. The main problem, everyone agrees, is that some computers that help controllers track airplanes are at least 25 years old and long past due for replacement, but updated technology has been delayed because contractors have not been able to write the software for new equipment. Even though the Federal Aviation Administration is facing a difficult stretch, until new systems are designed, tested and installed it is doing something surprising with maintenance: cutting back. It is also letting equipment go unattended on night shifts, eliminating training for technicians and cutting back on hiring, so that in some busy air traffic control centers half the technicians are eligible to retire.  <p>Even if the surge in failures of traffic control computers never results in a crash -- and none has so far -- each new breakdown delays anywhere from dozens to hundreds of flights, which the airlines say costs them millions and costs passengers even more.</p> <p>In this rough period, the short-term outlook is dismal. Many of the technicians who can retire are likely to do so this year or next because Congress is planning to cut the retirement benefits of those who retire later. Lawmakers have already cut the pay of some of them by eliminating some cost-of-living increases that other Federal employees get.</p> <p>For 35 years, the F.A.A. has exerted control over all commercial airliners from takeoff to landing. Planes are tracked by tower controllers with binoculars and local radar, by controllers in Terminal Radar Approach Controls, called Tracons, which may serve several airports, and by controllers in the 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers around the nation. The Tracons and the centers share data from nationwide radar installations and talk to the planes over a network of radio transmitters and receivers. The centers also handle oceanic traffic, which they cannot see, via radio.</p> <p>There are very few new technicians in training, but even hiring more would not help because some vital pieces of equipment are so old that they are operated nowhere else in the world and the F.A.A. stopped training technicians to maintain and repair them years ago.</p> <p>Some breakdowns, like failures of the equipment to alert controllers to potential collisions, are obvious to pilots only because they are told to wait on the ground, or to increase spacing in the sky, while the controllers reduce the traffic to a level the degraded equipment can handle. Sometimes it is obvious because there is no controller&#39;s voice at the other end of the radio; in that case, pilots may switch frequencies to try to reach the controller they just left. Occasionally they reach a controller elsewhere and ask permission for an altitude or heading change only to be told that the controller has no authority to instruct them.</p> <p>The last line of defense for passenger planes is their on-board collision-avoidance systems. Two American Airlines pilots relied on that system a few months ago when faulty equipment in San Juan, P.R., led a controller to direct them toward a head-on collision.</p> <p>At the same time, the breakdowns may have growing safety consequences because they are becoming more serious and stranger; there are &quot;ghost targets&quot; of planes on the screen that are not really in the sky, planes that do not show up at all and frequent flickers and blinks.</p> <p>The air traffic controllers say that in at least one incident recently, the equipment led them to believe that it was carrying out certain automatic functions when in fact it was malfunctioning. The equipment was, in effect, lying to them about its condition.</p> <p>The F.A.A. denies that this happened, but its version of what went wrong strikes Federal safety investigators as equally ominous. The F.A.A. suggests that the problem may have been confusion among the controllers about how to manage when only some equipment was working -- confusion that may itself be a safety problem.</p> <p>The National Transportation Safety Board is sufficiently concerned about the recent rash of failures to have sent investigators to Aurora, Ill., and other centers to explore the issue. Safety board officials said they would comment on their concerns and findings when the investigation is complete early next month. The Resources  Equipment Ages As Staffs Shrink</p> <p>Often the problem is old equipment failing, but the F.A.A. has also got into trouble as it modernizes, with new equipment, evidently with bugs, breaking down. That has resulted in several power failures and the collapse last week of a Voice Switching Control System in Seattle, the first installation of this technology. The system is the prototype that is supposed to replace old, less reliable connections between the centers and their radio antennas, which are spread out over the territories that the centers control.</p> <p>The F.A.A. counts 11 failures since a 75-minute power failure last Sept. 14 at the Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center in Aurora, one of the 20 high-altitude and intercity control centers around the nation; the list includes two power failures at another center in Ronkonkoma, L.I., and one earlier this month at the Oakland center in Fremont, Calif., along with four major computer breakdowns in the Chicago center and others in Fort Worth and Washington. The unions representing the technicians and the controllers also cite major failures at air traffic control offices in Miami, Los Angeles, San Juan and elsewhere.</p> <p>Each failure has unique aspects, but most share a common component: electronic equipment that is 30 years old and was supposed to have been replaced years ago, before crippling breakdowns became endemic to the system.</p> <p>F.A.A. officials acknowledge that they have had problems, but they defend their system.</p> <p>Discussing the Aurora center&#39;s performance reliability, Martin G. Duffy, manager of the F.A.A. Chicago Systems Management Office, said, &quot;We are as close to 99-point-whatever as we can get.&quot; Drawing a diagram of the center&#39;s computer system for a visitor and explaining what went wrong, he pounded the blackboard for emphasis, asserting, &quot;We moved 8,600 airplanes that day through this airspace.&quot;</p> <p>Union officials say they are proud of not doing any worse with equipment so old that no spare parts are commercially available and neither the manufacturer nor third-party vendors will service it.</p> <p>Jack Johnson, the president of the Professional Airways Systems Specialists, the Washington-based union that represents the technicians, said that inadequate maintenance was responsible for the growing number of failures and the long periods of time it takes to rectify them.</p> <p>The Oakland blackout, he pointed out, occurred just after 7 A.M. when a transformer blew. Transformers usually smoke before they fail; a technician on duty would literally have smelled trouble coming, he said. But there is no longer a technician on the midnight shift at Oakland, a situation that is now common throughout the F.A.A.&#39;s system.</p> <p>Short staffing was also acknowledged by the F.A.A. as a reason that recovery was so slow from a power failure in New York in May.</p> <p>Mr. Johnson&#39;s position has a self-serving element: his union is shrinking, down to 6,000 technicians today from 11,600 in 1981, even though the number of systems that the technicians are responsible for maintaining has risen to 31,000 from 19,000. But Mr. Johnson probably does not have to worry about layoffs, given the rate at which his members can retire.</p> <p>&quot;We have cut 5,000 jobs in the last five years,&quot; said George Donohue, an assistant administrator for technology acquisition with the F.A.A. &quot;We cut them because we had to cut them,&quot; he said.</p> <p>While the F.A.A.&#39;s operating budgets have been flat, Mr. Donohue said, &quot;flat means negative 3 percent a year; people forget about inflation. The Civil Service increases salaries based on the cost of living, and the work force goes down.&quot;</p> <p>The agency wants to reduce its work force by 19 percent in the next five years. But it anticipates 18 percent growth in the amount of traffic handled in that period, Mr. Donohue said.</p> <p>At the New York Center, in Ronkonkoma, which has had 16 &quot;significant outages&quot; in which one or more major systems failed between May 1993 and last June, there are 67 technicians and support personnel, down from 108 in 1991. The F.A.A. plans to hire 12 more, but 16 are eligible to retire.</p> <p>&quot;You can have all the air traffic controllers in the world in a center,&quot; said Henry G. Brown, the technicians union&#39;s representative at Ronkonkoma, &quot;and if you don&#39;t have a technician to keep them going, they can all go home.&quot;</p> <p>Airlines and elected officials are also increasingly concerned about equipment; the airlines recently asked the F.A.A. to employ &quot;utmost haste&quot; to replace the part that has failed most often recently -- the I.B.M. 9020e, a refrigerator-sized computer with wiring that looks like cobwebs and is nearly as frail -- with an interim fix by 1997, even before long-term improvements can be made in 1999. The F.A.A. recently agreed.</p> <p>The F.A.A. acknowledges many problems, including with the 9020e. A recent internal study of the New York Center found that the 9020e computer -- a section of the system that takes radar data and flight-plan data from the mainframe computer and delivers it to controllers&#39; screens -- had failures 90 times between January 1992 and June 1993.</p> <p>The 9020e has many redundant parts, so a failure does not always mean a breakdown. But the failures were so frequent that the complex ran without some of its backup parts 56 percent of the time during that period, the study found. That left the system one failure away from breakdown -- akin to driving a car with a flat spare tire. Moreover, the study suggested that this probably represented conditions around the country.</p> <p>But F.A.A. officials continue to assert that even a breakdown is safe because it generally deprives controllers only of &quot;enhancements,&quot; like the ability of the computers to predict and point out conflicting flight paths. They can run the system safely without these tools, managers assert, if they reduce the amount of traffic in the sky.</p> <p>The amount of down time for the 9020e -- which failed in the Chicago Center on July 23 and again on July 24 -- doubled between the beginning of 1990 and the end of 1994, the study found.</p> <p>Mr. Johnson, the technicians union president, estimated that half the technicians were already eligible to retire or would be within three years. Hiring rates are very low, and new employees get inadequate training. For example, the last training session for the part that failed in Chicago, the I.B.M. 9020e, was in 1991. The F.A.A. plans another session this fall at its academy in Oklahoma City, but technicians in Chicago say they are so short-staffed they wonder how they will spare anyone for training.</p> <p>To find spare parts for the system, the F.A.A. has cannibalized one of the two 9020 models it keeps in Oklahoma City; only one survives for testing and training.</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s really strange that we continue to keep doing this,&quot; Mr. Johnson said of the cuts in the technician work force and the resulting cuts in maintenance.</p> <p>F.A.A. executives defend the trims in the work force, which has meant that parts that break tend to not get fixed. The agency dedicates lots of time to each piece of equipment when it is new, said Stanley Rivers, deputy director of the Airways Facilities Service of the F.A.A., which maintains the nation&#39;s network of radar equipment, radio beacons, control towers and air-traffic-control centers. After a break-in period, he said, careful records are kept about how often each part needs service, and work is scaled back accordingly.</p> <p>&quot;We really can&#39;t afford to have technicians do things that are not necessary or are redundant,&quot; Mr. Rivers said. In addition, he said, there is a good reason for servicing the 1960&#39;s computers less.</p> <p>&quot;One of things you&#39;re going to confront, particularly with older systems, with experienced technicians, is the need to not overstress the hardware,&quot; he said. Cables are brittle, vacuum tubes do not stand too much handling, circuit boards can break when flexed, and transistors can fail under the strain of testing, he said. &quot;As the system matures, you learn that some of that can become destructive after a while,&quot; he added.</p> <p>Mr. Rivers and others acknowledge that the agency started to pare its work force years ago in anticipation of getting replacement equipment: modern computers with low-maintenance microchips that can alert users when something goes wrong. But the F.A.A. is still dealing with equipment with vacuum tubes, dense webs of wiring, thousands of circuit boards and other components that are as extinct outside the F.A.A. as punch-card readers and core memories.</p> <p>Mr. Rivers also played down concerns about the possibility of mass retirements. Only 30 to 40 percent of the technicians will be eligible within the next three years, he said, and &quot;typically, they don&#39;t retire the day that they&#39;re eligible.&quot; Generally, only 13 percent of the work force retires in any given year, he said.</p> <p>Union members, though, say that a Congressional plan would change the rules in a way that would accelerate the retirements.</p> <p>Both the House and Senate have passed budget resolutions that could prompt more technicians to retire. The bills have a new formula for figuring benefits, based on the employee&#39;s five highest-paid years. The current formula uses the three highest-paid. Since most employees&#39; wages increase each year, the effect is to average in some lower-wage years, thus cutting retirement benefits for people who choose to delay their retirements until the new rules take effect.</p> <p>What is more, the count of how many technicians are eligible to retire is a national average, but retirements could be much higher at some centers. The case of Chicago is instructive.</p> <p>At the Air Route Traffic Control Center in Aurora, an outer suburb about 40 miles west of O&#39;Hare and Midway Airports, the center has 55 technicians; 24 are eligible to retire immediately and 5 more will be eligible in less than three years. The last time someone was hired was three years ago, and it generally takes three to five years for a new technician to be fully qualified. The Gaps  Repair Capability Is on the Decline</p> <p>In a pinch, technicians can be reassigned from other Airways Facilities offices, but the equipment -- and, therefore, the skills required to maintain and repair it -- differs from post to post.</p> <p>For the 9020e, the computer that failed repeatedly at Aurora, there have been no training courses since September 1991. On the two nights in July after the most recent breakdown, Peter Pecharich, a specialist on that computer, worked through the small hours of the morning, the only hours when traffic is light enough to allow maintenance to be done. Another technician there, one transferred recently from Alaska, was supposed to go to the F.A.A. Academy in Oklahoma City for a training course on the 9020e in July, so he would be qualified to do the work, but the course was canceled. The F.A.A. is now planning to hold an abbreviated course in October.</p> <p>At age 55, Mr. Pecharich will be eligible to retire in a few months, and he said he would like to leave. Congress is considering raising the retirement contributions from many Federal workers, including F.A.A. technicians, and cutting benefits; Mr. Pecharich said he would like to get out before that happened.</p> <p>William L. Casey, 62, is a veteran of nearly 40 years in the F.A.A. and is renowned among co-workers for pinpointing the source of problems. &quot;Each piece of equipment is going to have its own character,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But Mr. Casey, in the unofficial technician uniform -- plaid shirt over a white T-shirt, pocket stuffed with pens and glasses -- said he planned to retire in October. When Mr. Casey considers what he would receive in pension benefits, he said, he is coming out ahead by only about $6 an hour staying on the job. Mr. Casey said that there was no point waiting for his benefits to decline and that he was tired of wheeling huge, antiquated pieces of equipment to the shop. He added, &quot;Some of the oldest people in the facility are doing the hardest work.&quot;</p> <p>The declining work force means numerous &quot;open watches,&quot; or times when no one is on duty in areas that were staffed 24 hours a day when the equipment was younger. The reduction in the number of technicians has become so acute that the other big union at the centers, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, has complained about it.</p> <p>The result is that less repair work gets done. Wanda Geist, the technicians union shop steward at Aurora (and the newest employee -- she was hired three years ago) gave an example of that, citing the electronic modules, in computers, called &quot;vector generators,&quot; which allow the controller to see a line showing the route a plane is supposed to take for the next few minutes. Formerly, when one of the modules broke, Ms. Geist said, it would be swapped for a working spare. Now, she said, there are six spares, &quot;none of them ready to go into the system.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;A couple have been repaired,&quot; she said, &quot;but we have not had the down time to test them.&quot; The Hardware  Is the Equipment Still Trustworthy?</p> <p>As reliability declines, the controllers say, a new problem is developing with the equipment&#39;s integrity, the faithfulness with which it reports its condition. Integrity is central to the F.A.A.&#39;s repeated assurances to the public that only efficiency, not safety, has been compromised by recent failures. The agency says that when something has broken, the people who manage the system have quickly held planes on the ground and increased the spacing of planes in flight, slowing traffic down to a level that the degraded computers can handle.</p> <p>But a failure on May 17 at Aurora casts some doubt on integrity, the controllers said. They gave this account:</p> <p>When the screens began to flicker about 8:30 A.M., the controllers&#39; equipment, which has been shaky for years, did something new: it lied to them about what functions were still operating. The green circular screens at which they sit indicated that a large portion of the automatic system was continuing to assist them in controlling airplanes -- specifically, helping them in &quot;handing off&quot; planes from one controller to another -- when in fact it was dead.</p> <p>&quot;I didn&#39;t know I had to call up another controller to hand off a plane,&quot; said Michael J. Hannigan, a controller, who usually performs that task with a trackball mouse and the click of a button. For seven minutes, he and other controllers say, the system was telling them it was all right to use the mouse, pointing and clicking, to alert another controller, in Aurora or different centers, that a plane was being handed off to that controller, when in fact the computer switching was not working. The switch had to be made by telephone.</p> <p>The controllers also found that they had lost the ability to sit at their terminals and type in new flight plan information.</p> <p>The equipment was telling them that the 9020e computer had failed. In that condition, data from the nine radar dishes around the region continue to flow into the center, and the data can get to the controllers&#39; screens on two alternate routes. One is a backup bypass called the Direct Access Radar Channel, called DARC, and the other is through the main computer, called the host. The backup through the host computer provides more information than DARC, but still provides less than what the controller usually sees.</p> <p>The system told the controllers that they were operating with the DARC and host backup systems, called DARC-host mode, which would mean that they had lost safety enhancements like the ability to predict conflicting paths but retained the automatic-handoff function. In fact, the system lied: they were actually in a more degraded condition, with only DARC functioning.</p> <p>But Denis C. Burke, the Air Traffic Manager of the Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center, said that the system had actually been in DARC-host mode for about a minute, before slipping another notch, into DARC-only mode. The problem, he said, was that the controllers became confused because they had first seen a banner at the top of their screens indicating DARC-host mode. &quot;Then they looked back down at their traffic,&quot; he said, &quot;and the system went into DARC alone. But the brain still told them: &#39;DARC-host.&#39; &quot;</p> <p>Until the recent onset of multiple failures of the 9020e&#39;s, Mr. Burke said, &quot;we had 99.6 percent reliability; the controllers were not exposed to this.&quot;</p> <p>At the National Transportation Safety Board, investigators say that the problem may well be confusion among the controllers about operating in unfamiliar configurations that change rapidly. But that offers little solace, they say, since either possibility -- lying equipment or operator confusion -- is a safety concern.</p>
756380>In Some Places, Credit Hogs Have Limits WHEN merchants reserve more of a consumer&#39;s credit than the amount of a purchase, they are engaging in a practice that is not only annoying, but also sometimes illegal, according to the New York State Attorney General&#39;s office. After a customer pushes a credit card across a counter, some merchants routinely send an electronic message to the card issuer to reserve a chunk of the consumer&#39;s available credit. The practice is most common among rental car companies, gasoline stations and hotels, which want to assure that they are paid in full and do not know what the final bill will be. Hotels, for example, may block off extra credit to cover meals or telephone calls.  <p>But a New York law that has been in effect since 1980 says that merchants who furnish travel services, like hotel rooms or rental cars, cannot reserve credit without first notifying the consumer. And when the hotel guest checks out or the car renter returns the vehicle, the merchant must communicate the final cost promptly to the card issuer.</p> <p>In practice, the card issuer sometimes takes weeks to restore the credit, no matter how prompt the merchant is. And the 1980 law does not provide complete consumer protection. It specifically cites hotels, car rentals and &quot;other service related to travel,&quot; but is mum on whether it applies to gasoline stations, some of which block off excess credit for purchases made with some kinds of credit cards.</p> <p>Stephen E. Mindell, head of the consumer advocacy division of the Attorney General&#39;s office, said New York had passed the statute after a legislator told Robert Abrams, then the Attorney General, the story of a constituent who had spent little but whose card was rejected because his credit had been effectively placed on hold. Mr. Mindell said he did not know of any other state with a similar law.</p> <p>But given the recent publicity, Mr. Mindell said he would check whether companies were complying. &quot;I thought this was not an issue any longer,&quot; he said.</p>
419644>Currents, Not Man, Will Decide the Spill&#39;s Effects With oil from Kuwaiti spigots within 100 miles of reaching Saudi Arabia&#39;s main desalting plant, experts say that human efforts are no match for the tide of oil and that the plant&#39;s fate depends mostly on currents. Like an avalanche against a fence, the leading edge of the oil will brush aside containment booms and overwhelm boats that skim up oil if currents send large quantities their way. Trying to filter oil that evades the booms is not feasible because the plant gulps far too much water -- three billion gallons daily, twice as much water as New York City consumes. And the desalting process itself cannot separate oil from water.  <p>The Pentagon said yesterday that after an air attack on storage tank pipes in Kuwait on Saturday night, little if any additional oil was spilling into the sea. But a giant slick, 35 miles long, 10 miles wide and estimated to contain 11 million barrels of oil, continued to float south, several miles off the Kuwaiti and Saudi coasts.  Largest Such Plant in the World</p> <p>The Jubail plant, the largest in the world for separating salt from water, will have to be closed if its intake pipes begin to suck in substantial amounts of oil, experts say. Some say it will be closed if even tiny amounts of contamination reach its intake pipes.</p> <p>The plant has some defenses. Its intake pipes are 30 feet beneath the surface and protected by a harbor. The harbor is now protected by booms and, inside that defensive perimeter, patrolled by boats that can skim oil from the surface.</p> <p>The Saudis have installed booms that extend about three feet below the water&#39;s surface, which is about three times deeper than most, according to Leon Awerbuch, the president of the International Desalination Association, which is based in Topsfield, Mass.</p> <p>But if the slick arrives, he said, it is likely to breach the booms. What is more, even though the intake pipes are well below the surface, oil suspended in the water, as opposed to floating on its surface, could shut down the plant in concentrations as low as a few parts per million. Drinking Water Might Contain Oil</p> <p>Others think the plant could stand some oil intrusion without having to be shut down. James D. Birkett, a consultant who wrote studies on which some of the design work for Jubail was based, said that some oil might get into the drinking water. &quot;If you&#39;re talking about a longtime Environmental Protection Agency potable water quality standard, based on 70 years of exposure, it&#39;s quite possible this water might not measure up,&quot; he said. &quot;But we&#39;re talking about emergency wartime conditions.&quot;</p> <p>Oil poses two threats to desalting plants of the kind used by the Saudis. The plants work on a principle called multi-stage flash distillation. The plants boil salt water and gather the steam, which is turned back into water. The salt water that did not boil away is pumped into a second chamber where the air pressure is lower, causing it to boil again, and more salt-free steam is gathered. The process is repeated up to 40 times.</p> <p>Some oil would &quot;get co-distilled with the water,&quot; said Paul D. Boehm, vice president and director of marine sciences at Arthur D. Little, a consulting firm in Boston.</p> <p>If the concentration of oil is too high, the oil starts to stick to the metal surfaces that are used for transferring heat, gumming up the plant, experts say. But the plant would probably be shut before that happens, because it would already have ceased producing potable water.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia gets more than a third of its drinking water from Jubail and two other plants: Al Khobar, which is farther south and not presently threatened, and Khafji, near the Kuwaiti border, which is already closed.</p> <p>Of greatest concern is the plant at Jubail, which supplies Riyadh, the capital, with about 180 million gallons a day. Jubail&#39;s total output is about 270 million gallons of water a day.</p> <p>The Saudis have no significant fresh-water storage in the form of tanks or reservoirs, but wells could provide plenty for drinking if the plants were shut, experts say. Well water now used for agriculture could be diverted. Water is also needed for the Saudi petrochemical industry, and might also be diverted from those uses.  Combat Troops Use Well Water</p> <p>American experts stop short of saying that a shutdown, if it came, would be a crisis. &quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s ever going to be a problem for the Saudis or the troops not getting enough to drink,&quot; said another expert, Raymond F. Machacek of Arthur D. Little.</p> <p>Troops in the field get much of their water from wells. If these are brackish, the water is desalted with portable equipment using a process called reverse osmosis.</p> <p>Riyadh also has reverse osmosis plants. They were used until 1982, when the second phase of the Jubail plant was finished, and then mothballed. They reduce the salt content of well water and could provide about 55 million gallons a day, about 30 percent of what Jubail sends, Mr. Birkett said.  Riyadh Plants Unaffected</p> <p>The plants in Riyadh will be unaffected by the oil spill, since that spill will not contaminate underground water supplies. But another reverse osmosis plant on the coast would be quickly fouled by oil, which has hydrocarbon molecules thousands of times larger than those in water.</p> <p>WAR IN THE GULF: THE WATER PLANTS</p>
123423>Third Investor Seeks Sizable Texaco Stake A third investor has announced plans to buy a stake in Texaco Inc.  <p>The Getty Petroleum Corporation, formerly known as the Power Test Corporation, said yesterday that it had bought $14 million worth of Texaco&#39;s shares, or less than 1 percent of its shares outstanding, and would seek Government approval to buy more than $15 million in stock.</p> <p>The company, based in Jericho, L.I., is one of the country&#39;s largest independent retailers of gasoline and petroleum products. In 1985, after Texaco merged with the Getty Oil Company, Power Test purchased 1,900 Getty gas stations in the Northeastern and Middle Atlantic States, as well as terminals, trucks and other assets, from Texaco. It later adopted the Getty name.</p> <p>According to Stephen P. Salzman, Getty Petroleum&#39;s senior vice president, the company had sales of $969 million in the last nine months. Last July, Getty tried unsuccessfully to buy the Clark Oil and Refining Corporation, for which it had arranged financing of about $450 million.</p> <p>Getty said that it had had no dealings with T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman who said last week that he was seeking Federal permission to buy more than $15 million in shares, or Carl C. Icahn, who is Texaco&#39;s largest shareholder.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The more and more people acquire shares at these prices, they would be anticipating something from the company other than their normal track record,&#39;&#39; said David Bachelder, an adviser to Mr. Pickens. &#39;&#39;Their historical track record would not support these prices.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Texaco&#39;s stock closed yesterday at $42.875 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, up 62.5 cents each. Getty&#39;s shares rose 37.5 cents each, to $16.25.</p> <p>Texaco, based in White Plains, is negotiating the sale of a 50 percent interest in three refineries to an oil-exporting country, widely presumed to be Saudi Arabia. It needs cash to emerge from bankruptcy and pay a $3 billion settlement to the Pennzoil Company that resulted from a judgment against Texaco for $10.3 billion for interfering with Pennzoil&#39;s merger with Getty Oil.</p> <p>COMPANY NEWS</p>
426034>Bush Asserts Need for Foreign Oil Saying he was committed to &quot;the power of the marketplace,&quot; President Bush presented an energy policy today that he asserted would save energy, increase domestic production of fuels and improve the environment without new taxes or harsh Government edicts. Because the policy includes only a very limited effort to improve gasoline mileage -- the factor in the energy balance most experts believe easiest to influence -- Mr. Bush appeared to set the stage today for a major battle with Congress.  <p>The plan gives considerable attention to oil. In contrast to the energy policy initiatives undertaken by Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter in the oil crises that occured during their terms, the Bush proposal asserts that the United States will have to live with a high level of dependence on foreign oil. The nation should reduce its vulnerability to sudden price increases, the new plan says, through diversifying supply, improving the ability to switch to other fuels and raising efficiency.</p> <p>The Energy Secretary, James D. Watkins, defended the policy&#39;s approach to energy efficiency, saying that its critics &quot;want Government control of how you run your life.&quot;  Skepticism on Mileage</p> <p>Congressional reaction was especially skeptical on the issue of raising the fuel-economy requirements on automobiles, which swallow 40 percent of the oil used in this country. Representative Philip R. Sharp of Indiana, chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said it would be &quot;very hard&quot; to raise automobile mileage unless changes were required by the Government.</p> <p>Currently, auto makers are allowed a small exemption from the fuel-economy standard if they build cars that run on something besides gasoline. The Administration is proposing to do away with limits on the credits auto makers can earn with vehicles using alternative fuels. Critics say this step might create huge numbers of low-mileage vehicles that could run on methanol or some other substitute, but in all likelihood would be run on gasoline.</p> <p>Mr. Sharp said that this was possible, but he added that no one would market the fuel before vehicles were in place to use it.</p> <p>Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, called the Bush proposal &quot;breathtakingly dumb&quot; and added, &quot;Under this plan our consumption of imported oil will increae dramatically, even as our soldiers are engaged in combat in the Persian Gulf.&quot;</p> <p>Some analysts believe the war has created a political opportunity for new policies. Wilfrid Kohl, the director of the International Energy Program at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said: &quot;Obviously the Administration is not reading anything larger out of this gulf crisis. I think they&#39;re terribly mistaken, and I think the Democrats know that.&quot;</p> <p>A centerpiece of the plan, most details of which had become public in the last two weeks, is to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an area east of the Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska that is currently protected. That aspect, combined with the absence of new mandates for energy conservation, drew bitter comments from environmental organizations.</p> <p>&quot;The White House staff equates energy efficiency with sacrifice, and apparently doesn&#39;t mind sacrificing the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,&quot; said Daniel A. Lashof, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. But efficiency, he said, was simply performing the same work with less fuel. Industry&#39;s Point of View</p> <p>Reaction from the oil industry, meanwhile, ranged from lukewarm to cold. Charles DiBona, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, the largest trade organization, said the proposal was &quot;a good start in a reasonable direction.&quot; But a requirement for alternative fuel for fleet vehicles might save oil at an unjustifiably high cost, he said.</p> <p>Mr. DiBona said the plan, if enacted, would not halt the decline in American oil production. &quot;We would be doing very, very well to hold production at anything like constant,&quot; he said. And while the Bush Administration projected that the plan would hold imports to 40 to 45 percent of demand, Mr. DiBona said it would be difficult to cut the level that now prevails, which he said was about 50 percent.</p> <p>At the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents smaller oil and gas drillers, Denise A. Bode, the president, borrowed a phrase from President Bush&#39;s reaction to the Soviet peace plan and said that his energy plan &quot;falls short of the mark.&quot; It does not stabilize the price of oil and gas, which is needed for more investment, she said, and it does not eliminate tax inequities.</p> <p>The industry says it would increase domestic production if it were given subsidies to do so. Disagreeing With the Critics</p> <p>Mr. Watkins, in a briefing for reporters at the Energy Department, said that a goal of the policy was &quot;to wean ourselves away from this voracious appetite&quot; for oil. Linda G. Stuntz, a Deputy Under Secretary who supervised the drafting of the policy, said that &quot;tinkering&quot; with cars was &quot;not nearly as good an answer as looking for fundamentally different technology,&quot; in this case, alternative fuel.</p> <p>The Administration also disagrees with its critics over how much difference would result from raising the current standard, 27.5 miles a gallon; the Senate approved a bill last year that would have raised the standard to about 40 miles a gallon, and the sponsor, Senator Richard Bryan of Nevada, said it would save 2.8 million barrels a day by 2005. But Mr. Watkins said yesterday that it would save only 500,000 barrels a day, compared with letting the market take its course, in which case, he said, consumers will choose increasingly efficient cars as the years go by. &quot;It&#39;s not as though people are going to sit around at 27.5 miles per gallon,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But proponents of a change point to Government statistics showing that new vehicles sold last year were less efficient than those sold in the previous two years, suggesting that over the 1990&#39;s, market-driven improvements will be small, especially if the current low price of gasoline persists. Senator Bryan said yesterday that a bill like his would save almost 10 times as much oil daily as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was likely to produce, and added that raising auto efficiency standards was a proven success.</p> <p>&quot;No one argues that we would be better off today if our automobiles were less efficient,&quot; he said. AIMS OF THE NEW STRATEGY</p> <p>Projected results of the nearly 100 policy changes proposed by the Bush Administration, based on its computerized model of energy production and consumption patterns. The Administration expects the following results in the year 2010: Increase domestic oil production by 3.8 million barrels a day and reduce demand by 3.4 million barrels a day, from projected levels. Hold oil imports to 40 to 45 percent of demand. The model projected 65 percent reliance on imports if no action is taken. Increase the amount of domestic oil that can be profitably pumped by 20 billion barrels to 75 billion barrels. Increase by 16 percent the production of electricity from renewable sources, like hydro, solar and wind. Reduce total energy consumption by 7.5 quadrillin B.T.U.&#39;s. If no action is taken, the model projects a rise in consumption from 85 quadrillion B.T.U.&#39;s to about 100 quadrillion B.T.U.&#39;s Save consumers $750 billion in gasoline, home heating oil and other liquid fuel bills and $130 billion in electric bills, through increased efficiency. Cut gasoline and home heating oil prices by 10 percent.</p>
1347282>Aircraft Safety and the Case of the Plastic Tail Until an Airbus A300 crashed on Nov. 12 near Kennedy International Airport, the specialists whom the National Transportation Safety Board called to the wreckage when structural failure was suspected were called metallurgists. Now, one veteran investigator said at the scene of the crash, &#39;&#39;They&#39;ve renamed themselves &#39;materials scientists.&#39; &#39;&#39; That is because aircraft components are increasingly not metal at all, but composite -- a combination of fibers and glue. From airplane structures to highway bridges to truck trailers and tennis rackets, composites are supplanting aluminum, steel and other metals.  <p>The most popular composite is carbon fiber reinforced plastics, known as C.F.R.P.,  but other forms abound, chiefly epoxies, resins or plastics reinforced with fibers of glass, graphite, boron or aramid, the chemical name for Kevlar.</p> <p>C.F.R.P. made up the vertical tail and the rudder on American Airlines Flight 587, the plane that crashed. Both the vertical tail and the rudder came off before the crash, but it is not known whether this failure caused the crash or happened as the plane twisted in its fall. When it struck the ground, the fuselage still had scraps of composite material attached, with some pieces ending in fibers extending upward like brush bristles.</p> <p>Like all aircraft structures, the tail was designed to function even if it was subjected to 50 percent more force than its &#39;&#39;limit load,&#39;&#39; the highest load it was expected to see in its lifetime. The A300 may have incorporated a huge design error, or the fin on this plane may have had an undetected flaw that made it weaker than expected.</p> <p>Either way, the aviation industry is worried, because composites offer several important advantages. They weigh 20 percent to 25 percent less than aluminum parts of the same shape. And, composite parts do not expand or contract with temperature changes -- a benefit for a machine that sits on runways in the tropics and then climbs into the freezing stratosphere.</p> <p>When moisture condenses on them, they do not rust. They are less prone than metal to weakening with repeated flexing, a condition called fatigue. And while the carbon fiber can cost three times as much as aluminum, pound for pound, fewer pounds are needed for a given part. Also, composites can be fabricated in larger pieces and require less labor.</p> <p>But they are more complicated to make, and the inspection and diagnostic techniques are different too.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;re going to get smart on this real fast,&#39;&#39; said Thomas A. Haueter, the safety board&#39;s senior investigator on the scene.</p> <p>All composite materials are some kind of fiber held within some kind of a glue known as a matrix. The fibers are selected for the degree of stiffness -- or flexibility -- desired in the application; stiff for fuselage parts in airplanes, springy for tennis rackets. The matrix is chosen for its ability to adhere to the fibers and to itself. But composite materials have an additional advantage: they can be &#39;&#39;engineered&#39;&#39; to be strong where they need to be, without wasting materials and weight that would provide strength where it is not needed.</p> <p>Eric I. Madaras, an aerospace technologist at the NASA research center in Langley, Va., likens composites to the reinforced cellophane tape that is used to wrap packages. The composites do not have the cellophane, &#39;&#39;just the sticky stuff,&#39;&#39; he said, but like the tape, they are strong in one direction and not in others. The tape can easily be ripped lengthwise, but not across its width; someone wrapping a package would line up the fibers in the direction of stress. If the package required it, a wrapper might run the tape in stripes at right angles.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The whole advantage of these things is you can get stiffnesses and strengths in certain directions,&#39;&#39; Mr. Madaras said.</p> <p>In a composite, designers may lay out the fibers in only one direction. For example, a pole-shaped part that would be under tension continually might only have fibers running the length of the pole. But the fibers can be put down in layers, some running at 90 degrees to one another, or 45 degrees to one another; the ratio of fibers running each way would define the strength on each axis. Electric companies planning utility poles for a ridge top where the wind blows  strongest from a single direction, for example, can order poles that are less prone to bend in one direction than another, a characteristic impossible to specify in the usual material for such poles, tree trunks.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You can tune the properties the way you want,&#39;&#39; said Dr. Riyad S. Aboutaha, an associate professor of civil engineering at Syracuse University.</p> <p>In carbon fiber, the layers are about five-thousandths of an inch thick. The main manufacturing method is to order &#39;&#39;prepreg&#39;&#39; sheets of fibers that are preimpregnated with resin or epoxies, to lay them down in the pattern desired, squeeze them together and cook them under pressure for a few hours, with the pressure and temperature, including cooling time, adjusted according to the product&#39;s intended use.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s a god-awful process,&#39;&#39; said Dr. A. George Bennett, who is retired as an aerospace engineering professor at Mississippi State University and as director of the university&#39;s Raspet Flight Research Lab. Quality control must be exacting, he said, to assure that no bubbles remain in the material that can form voids, making the structure weaker, or other errors in curing the matrix. The Federal Aviation Administration requires strict quality-control procedures. One problem is that &#39;&#39;pre preg&#39;&#39; must be kept refrigerated until use, and it has a short shelf life.</p> <p>The strength-to-weight ratio of carbon is about twice as great as that for aluminum, Dr. Bennett said. But the actual weight saving is closer to 25 percent because builders must add extra epoxy and fiber where fittings are attached. Still, he said, 25 percent is &#39;&#39;a terrific incentive.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>More recently, NASA has been working on a method of stitching layers together with aramid. Others are weaving fibers with a warp and a weft. Both techniques require fibers that can withstand small-radius turns without snapping.</p> <p>The vertical tail was the first use of carbon fiber in an airliner&#39;s skeleton, Dr. Bennett said, although smaller parts, like flaps and landing-gear doors, have been used longer.</p> <p>And the A300 is hardly the most advanced; the Boeing 777, a newer design, has both the horizontal and vertical tail made from composites. And the military makes even wider use of composites.</p> <p>The light weight is useful in civil engineering, too. Dr. Aboutaha has helped design five bridge renovations in upstate New York that use fiberglass to replace the original steel, in the deck and the superstructure. &#39;&#39;The bridge deck is completely made of composites; there are no steel beams, no concrete beams,&#39;&#39; he said of the five bridges. &#39;&#39;The only thing made of conventional building materials is the supports.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>With less structural weight on the supports, the bridges can handle heavier trucks, he said. And road salt is no longer a corrosion threat.</p> <p>In California, engineers have wrapped steel bridge supports in carbon fiber, to brace them against earthquakes, without adding much weight to the structures. Automobiles also use composites, mostly for body panels, not chassis. But engineers are studying how to use them to improve crash performance.</p> <p>The infiltration of composites into cars and bridges is, in a way, more impressive than their use in planes, because aviation engineers are willing to spend far more to save a pound of weight, since that saves expensive fuel. For bridges and cars, a weight saving is less important.</p> <p>But with all these advantages, composites also have weaknesses. One is that, unlike aluminum, composites are relatively intolerant of stress concentration; they will not stretch and give even a little bit. In other words, composites are more brittle, lacking what engineers call ductility. A related problem is that if composites are struck -- by a hammer, a food-catering truck or anything else that commonly bumps into a plane -- they may suffer damage that is not immediately obvious. Cracks in the matrix can eventually lead to cracks in the fibers.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You have to be very careful with inspection of any minor cracking,&#39;&#39; said Dr. Aboutaha of Syracuse. &#39;&#39;It may snap very quickly.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Another problem is moisture, which weakens the ability of the matrix to withstand compression. Moisture is always a problem on planes because they sit in high humidity on the ground, and then fly to cooler altitudes where the vapor condenses.</p> <p>On its own, the matrix will not absorb much water, but the fibers can form a wick and lead water in.</p> <p>Technicians have a variety of techniques for examining composites. When the F.A.A. ordered airlines that fly the A300 and a closely related plane, the A310, to examine their tails for damage, it told them to conduct detailed visual inspections, looking for indentations, dimples and other changes, using extra lighting, mirrors and magnifying glasses.</p> <p>Similarly low-tech is the &#39;&#39;tap test.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You take a quarter, and you drop it on the structure,&#39;&#39; said H. Benson Dexter, who retired from NASA as a senior materials researcher this year. &#39;&#39;If it&#39;s laminated material and the layers separated, you get a dull return. If it&#39;s a solid, well-bonded structure, you get a higher pitch, a ping-type noise,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Some inspectors will substitute a hammer for a quarter, he said.</p> <p>Another technique is to heat the structure, using infrared rays, and watch for uneven warm-up or cooling, another sign of delamination.</p> <p>Another method is ultrasonic probing, usually in a single dimension. Technicians run a pulse of sound into the material and listen for echoes. If it is solid, there will be just one; if there is a gap in the material, it will produce an extra echo.</p> <p>While the diagnostic methods are different, materials scientists say composites can be checked just as aluminum can. And the material has advantages over metal; it is less prone to degrade with age. &#39;&#39;We have a 50-year-old fiberglass airplane that is like the day it was built,&#39;&#39; Dr. Bennett said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s amazing. The adhesives don&#39;t seem to degrade.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But another aspect of composites has slowed their use: getting over the idea of new materials. Though used by the military since the early 1970&#39;s, composites have only recently won acceptance in civilian planes, Dr. Bennett said, because &#39;&#39;it&#39;s taken this long to get comfortable with it.&#39;&#39;</p>
120753>U.S. WON&#39;T REOPEN PLUTONIUM PLANT The United States Department of Energy said yesterday that it would not reopen the nation&#39;s largest plant for making plutonium for nuclear weapons, which has been shut for safety improvements for 13 months.  <p>The plant, the 25-year-old N Reactor on the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State, lacks some safety features that are standard on civilian plants. It has been the object of increasing concern since the explosion in April 1986 at the Chernobyl plant in the Soviet Union, to which it bears some similarity in design.</p> <p>A panel of six experts selected by the Energy Department after the Chernobyl accident concluded in December 1986 that the plant required major improvements. Two of the six called for closing it and today&#39;s announcement had been expected. $70 Million Already Spent In its announcement, the department said the reactor would be placed in &#39;&#39;cold standby status,&#39;&#39; with its fuel removed, but that safety improvements and engineering reviews would be completed, probably by mid-summer. About $70 million has been spent and $30 million more work remains, according to a spokesman, Jack Vandenberg.</p> <p>The work includes installation of equipment to eliminate hydrogen, a potentially explosive gas that can build up during an accident, and work to reduce the plant&#39;s vulnerability to earthquakes, as well as tests for aging and damage from radiation. The work, already seven months behind the original schedule, is now expected to be finished by mid-summer.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;These actions will allow the department the option of restarting the N Reactor if national security requirements prompt an increased demand for plutonium and new production facilities are not available,&#39;&#39; the department said. Such a restart would take at least two years. #2,600 Jobs Affected The agency said there were 3,300 employees at the N Reactor and other plants that process plutonium at Hanford, and that 2,600 of them apparently would lose their jobs. The plant is operated by a subsidiary of Westinghouse Electric Corporation.</p> <p>Plutonium is a man-made element used in most nuclear bombs and in some research projects. The Energy Department plans to seek proposals for a new reactor to make plutonium.</p> <p>The department said that it would meet the Pentagon&#39;s demand for plutonium from three reactors at its Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, from plutionium from retired nuclear weapons, and from residue material.</p>
485690>Technology; Mining Deep Underground for Energy Across vast areas of the world, Government scientists say, it should soon be possible to drill a hole in the ground and harvest energy that is abundant and environmentally benign. This is not oil or gas, but heat. Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico are seeking to tap the heat within the earth, which comes from earth&#39;s molten core or from radioactive decay and which geologists say dwarfs the energy content of oil, coal or natural gas.  <p>By the end of this month, after a decade of work, they hope to begin producing usable quantities of heat in the form of hot water, from the bedrock 12,000 feet under Fenton Hill, N.M. Water heated deep within the earth will be brought to the surface and used to make steam.</p> <p>One enthusiastic backer, Stewart Udall, a former Secretary of the Interior, said in a recent letter inviting energy specialists to a conference on geothermal heat that the technology is so promising that &quot;at first blush, it might seem to be a product of science fiction speculation.&quot;</p> <p>The energy to be harvested in New Mexico is from hot dry rock, which is different from a technology already in commercial use using heat from underground. Several companies take heat from the wet rock in Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast states to make electricity, by tapping into water that has seeped into rock that holds heat from the earth&#39;s core. But that water exists in only a few places.</p> <p>By contrast, after spending more than $160 million in Federal money on research and tests, Los Alamos researchers are convinced that hot dry rock is found almost everywhere, if the well is deep enough.</p> <p>In many places, they say, the temperature gradient between the surface and the rock below is large enough so the depth of the wells is easily within the ability of existing drilling technology. In about 2 percent of the land mass of the United States, according to Los Alamos scientists, the gradient per kilometer is greater than 45 degrees centigrade (or about 125 degrees Fahrenheit per mile), making hot dry rock practical if the electricity can be sold wholesale for 9 to 10 cents a kilowatt-hour.</p> <p>That price is not currently competitive with natural gas or coal plants, but it might be if credit were given for the fact that the generating system creates no carbon dioxide, the combustion product believed to cause climate change, or other pollutants.  The New Mexico test site has a slightly higher thermal gradient -- 65 degrees centigrade per kilometer -- and will bring up water at 240 degrees centigrade. Getting water that hot from a site with a smaller gradient would simply mean drilling deeper. Water not hot enough to make steam for electricity would still work well for heating homes, running factories and for meeting some needs in an electric plant.</p> <p>Even if a gradient of 60 to 70 degrees is required, vast parts of the western United States qualify, according to researchers.</p> <p>If the energy of the earth&#39;s crust could be economically tapped, the resource base would be hundreds of times larger than any now in use, according to a study published by Los Alamos in 1989.</p> <p>The standard measure of energy consumption from all sources is one quadrillion British thermal units. A B.T.U. is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit, and a quadrillion is a &quot;1&quot; with 15 zeroes. The United States consumes about 80 quadrillion B.T.U.&#39;s annually, from coal, oil, gas, nuclear power and all other sources, but the estimated energy potential of hot dry rock nationwide is 10 million quads, the study found, more energy than this country uses in thousands of years.</p> <p>The Los Alamos study, which referred to the process as &quot;mining heat,&quot; noted that many underground resources are not fully recoverable. &quot;However, even if only 0.1 percent or 0.01 percent of the accessible hot dry rock resource base is ultimately extracted, the impact on the U.S. energy supply would be far-reaching,&quot; it said.</p> <p>Mr. Udall, who is chairman of the Center for Resource Management, a nonprofit organization in Salt Lake City that studies energy and environment issues, is organizing a conference next month to share information with government officials, utility officials, environmentalists and others on the potential of hot dry rock, with Los Alamos as a co-sponsor. Among the benefits he points out is that the system has no waste. The water that carries the heat from underground is re-injected through the other well, forming a closed loop.</p> <p>The Los Alamos test involves twin 12,000-foot wells, one for injecting water, the other for retrieving the hot water for steam. Drilling is a challenge, because by definition the rock is hot. Also, the target material is hard rock, not the softer sedimentary rock oil drillers go after. This makes the work cumbersome and costly.</p> <p>The reward at the bottom is rock that is very hot but also very solid. Technicians inject water at very high pressure, to open up fractures in the rock, through which the water flows. &quot;People tell me they&#39;re less than a millimeter,&quot; said David V. Duchane, the program manager for the Los Alamos geothermal energy program. But no one is sure. &quot;Remember,&quot; he said, &quot;no one has ever been down there.&quot;</p> <p>So far the rock has not behaved exactly as expected. The original plan was to drill the ends of the two wells near each other, pump water into one and wait for it to flow to the other. But when the water was pumped in at pressure high enough to open fissures in the rock, at 2,700 pounds per square inch, the water went off in its own direction, probably following natural stress lines. Drillers had to move the bottom of the second well to find the water. Next time, said Mr. Duchane, they will drill the first hole, create the reservoir, locate it through micro-seismic tests and then drill the second well into it.</p> <p>Another problem, especially in the arid West, is that in an earlier test the system seemed to lose excessive amounts of water. Some of the water seemed to bleed away, but most, Mr. Duchane said, was probably absorbed by microcracks in the rock. &quot;That can&#39;t go on forever,&quot; he said, predicting that at some point losses would drop to a small amount.</p> <p>Hot dry rock plants could be useful in balancing electric systems through the hours of the day, say backers. In years to come, many analysts expect windmills and solar cells to provide an increasing portion of electric power, but those sources are notoriously intermittent and must be complemented with plants that can start or stop quickly, a capability nuclear plants and most coal plants lack. Hot dry rock plants could alter output quickly.</p> <p>Outsiders are watching the experiment carefully. &quot;It&#39;s not a sure thing, but it does have potential,&quot; saidDr. Evan E. Hughes, a project manager at the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility consortium in Palo Alto, Calif. &quot;Hot dry rock could be big enough to supply virtually all the electricity we need.&quot;</p> <p>But the price must be competitive, he said, and &quot;no one&#39;s going to believe it until they&#39;ve seen it done.&quot; It will probably take more than a single test to demonstrate, Dr. Hughes added.</p> <p>John R. Bailey, a geologist in Tulsa, Okla., who is a consultant to O&#39;Brien Energy Systems, a geothermal company, also believes hot dry rock has large-scale potential. Existing geothermal plants already produce energy for electricity and for everything from heating greenhouses to drying potato chips, he said, and hot dry rock is far more widespread.</p> <p>Successful fields at the moment, said Mr. Bailey and other experts, rely on having several production wells and a single well for re-injection. Thus the pair of wells at Fenton Hill will not represent the economic questions fairly.</p> <p>With natural gas at historic low prices, any new technologies face a stiff hurdle. But &quot;if there were another energy crisis, this would be economically possible in the East,&quot; Mr. Bailey said.</p> <p>For example, he said, the Adirondack mountains in New York could be suitable, and lots of water is available there. &quot;Ultimately, you can get hot dry rock almost anywhere, if you&#39;re willing to drill deep enough,&quot; he said.</p>
847533>PASSENGER PLANES IN MILITARY FLEET GET SAFETY HELP Responding to the crash of an Air Force passenger plane that killed Commerce  Secretary Ronald H. Brown and 34 other people, the Pentagon announced today that it would immediately begin adding better navigation equipment to all 2,800 passenger planes in its fleet. Mr. Brown&#39;s plane was more than a mile off course when it hit a mountain on approach to the airport in Dubrovnik, Croatia, on April 3, and many experts believe that more precise navigation instruments would have helped to prevent the accident.  <p>The announcement by the Pentagon today followed Defense Secretary William J. Perry&#39;s ordering a review of equipment and procedures used on all military passenger planes -- troop carriers as well as aircraft customarily used to transport high Government officials and others the military calls &quot;distinguished visitors.&quot; The new safety steps apply to both categories of aircraft.</p> <p>&quot;We felt we should leave no stone unturned in providing the very best technology we can provide as soon as possible, &quot; said Dr. Paul G. Kaminski, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology.</p> <p>That urgency amounts to a major change in the Pentagon&#39;s approach to safety in its passenger fleet. For years, the services have relied on training and the  good sense of transport planes&#39; pilots instead of additional navigation aids that the military was installing on its advanced combat aircraft.</p> <p>Dr. Kaminski also announced today that the Pentagon would accelerate its plans to equip its passenger planes with flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders -- the &quot;black boxes&quot; that have been required in civilian planes for years. Mr. Brown&#39;s plane was equipped with neither a voice recorder nor a data recorder, complicating the inquiry into what went wrong.</p> <p>Air Force planes will have the recorders by next year, and Navy planes by 1998. The services have resisted the devices for years, maintaining that they are valuable only as tools to investigate crashes that have already occurred and that the money that would be spent on them is better used elsewhere.</p> <p>As for the improved navigation equipment, Dr. Kaminski said today that by the end of September, military pilots would be given hand-held instruments that use  satellite data to pinpoint longitude, latitude and altitude to within 50 feet. Some will also get laptop computers that connect to the hand-held units, to display maps with a moving &quot;you are here&quot; dot.</p> <p>The American military has been using the hand-held instruments on the ground  for years and has more than 50,000 of them, which are bought in bulk for $850 each.</p> <p>The device listens for signals from a halo of satellites, and triangulates its position from them. The system cost the Defense Department $7 billion to create and, although not yet approved by the Federal Aviation Administration as  a primary navigation aid for commercial jetliners flying over the continental United States, is being tested on trans-Pacific routes where no land-based navigation aids are available. It is also widely used by civilians who sail or hike or who fly private planes, as well as by some farmers, who use it on tractors to pinpoint their location in the fields.</p> <p>But the military, citing cost, has been slow to provide its own noncombat planes with the equipment needed to use the signals.</p> <p>In announcing the abandonment of that reluctance today, Dr. Kaminski said, &quot;Knowing where you are to within 50 feet will be a big help.&quot;</p> <p>The hand-held device, which the Pentagon calls a &quot;plugger,&quot; for Precision Light Global Positioning System Receiver, has a Velcro-type strip on the back so that it can be affixed to a bulkhead.</p> <p>Dr. Kaminski said the military&#39;s passenger planes would be rewired within a few years so that the satellite information flowed directly into existing cockpit instruments. At that point, he said, the pluggers, which weigh about three pounds each and look a little like the computers carried by car rental clerks at airport check-in lots, can be used by the military for other purposes.</p> <p>Installing the integrated systems that will allow the satellite data to flow  into existing instruments will not be completed until 2002, Dr. Kaminski said. He said this work would cost the Air Force &quot;a little under $70 million.&quot; The cost will be something less for the Navy and less still for the Army, whose fleet of passenger aircraft is far smaller than those of the two other services.</p> <p>&quot;This is a modest cost,&quot; Dr. Kaminski said. &quot;It&#39;s modest in the sense all the equipment we&#39;re procuring for this purpose is usable for other purposes once the other upgrades take place.&quot;</p> <p>The total cost of all the changes announced today, including the accelerated  installation of voice and data recorders as well as the upgrading of navigation  aids, was put at $335 million.</p> <p>Although experts say the Global Positioning System, or GPS, could have helped prevent the crash of Mr. Brown&#39;s plane, they also say it could not have done so  without one other thing: the plane&#39;s pilots would have needed a map correlating the runway location to the longtitude and latitude shown by the device.</p> <p>Some airports already have such maps for use with GPS. But the system is so accurate that at other airports, Air Force officials say, using it can be dangerous. The reason is that the stated location of some airports is not completely correct: the longitude and latitude given on existing maps, to which  GPS will flawlessly guide the airplane, may be hundreds of yards away from the runway. The Dubrovnik airport, among others, has not been re-surveyed with GPS in mind.</p> <p>The policy changes announced today were addressed to the Secretaries of the Air Force, the Navy and the Army in a memorandum from Secretary Perry. The memorandum directed the services, &quot;as a matter of highest priority,&quot; to install  GPS on all military passenger aircraft. &quot;As the next priority,&quot; it said, &quot;you should install flight data recorders on your fixed-wing, commercial-derivative aircraft.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Perry has not yet made a decision on whether to equip military passenger  planes with anti-collision radar, which is required on commercial jetliners, and with ground proximity warning systems, which can alert pilots when their planes are flying dangerously low. The plane carrying Mr. Brown, a a military version of the Boeing 737, did have a ground proximity system. But that system was of an early vintage and probably provided little warning, if any, experts say.</p> <p>Mr. Perry also directed Dr. Kaminski to begin a study of how data from the new flight data recorders could be gathered from planes in routine operation, and studied to improve safety. Airlines in Europe do this regularly, and American carriers are beginning to do the same.</p>
1360490>Airlines Say They Are Set To Meet Screening Deadline As the airlines struggle to meet a Friday deadline that requires them to screen all checked baggage, the new head of the Transportation Security Administration said today that aviation officials had hurt security since the Sept. 11 attacks by talking too much about their methods. The airlines say they will meet the new requirement, set by Congress in the aviation security law it passed in November, by using explosive detection machines, sniffer dogs or manual searches, or simply assuring that no bag goes on a plane without its owner, a technique called bag matching which is already used on international flights.  <p>But the number of machines and dogs is still small, and the biggest element in most airlines&#39; plans is bag matching, a senior transportation department official said.</p> <p>Most airlines can determine quickly if they have loaded a bag without the owner being aboard, but getting the bag back out of the hold has been difficult. &#39;&#39;You have to find the bag,&#39;&#39;  one airline official said.</p> <p>That is especially tough in narrow-body aircraft, where suitcases are loaded directly into the plane. In jumbo jets, they are organized into separate bins, and if bag handlers have to find a suitcase, they know which bin to look in.</p> <p>The airlines mostly believe that they will operate normally on Friday, although none are certain.</p> <p>At American, John Hotard, a spokesman, said: &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve never done this before at the domestic level. We&#39;re not sure.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The airline has been using bag matching at selected airports for the last two weeks and it has gone well, Mr. Hotard said.</p> <p>United Airlines will institute the system on Tuesday at 11 airports, including three United Express stations, to test it. A spokesman for United, Chris Brathwaite, said that the airline did not anticipate problems in the test or on Friday, but that if nervous customers tried carrying more luggage on board, that could create slowdowns at the passenger-screening checkpoints.</p> <p>Mr. Brathwaite said passengers who had checked a bag but then decided they would not take the flight -- because they had to take an urgent conference call, for example -- should tell a customer service agent as soon as possible.</p> <p>The bag matching system is not comprehensive. Two aviation experts said that if a customer was supposed to connect to a second plane, airlines would not have to determine that both the bag and the customer made it on to that plane.</p> <p>And, as Norman Y. Mineta, the transportation secretary, observed last month, 100 percent bag matching would do nothing to deter a suicidal terrorist. Transportation officials have been emphasizing that the important deadline is not the 18th, but Dec. 31, 2002, when all bags will have to pass through explosive detection machines.</p> <p>That, too, will be a challenge. Transportation officials have not yet decided what machines, and in what combination, they will buy.</p> <p>As the airlines continued their preparations, the government official in charge of transportation security, John Magaw, making his first public appearance since President Bush installed him, told a transportation conference that he was disappointed in disclosures by security experts after a man with explosives in his shoe was subdued on a trans-Atlantic American Airlines flight.</p> <p>Until recently, Mr. Magaw said, security officials had been comfortable that they knew several characteristics of passengers who merited attention. But after the man was subdued, news reports said those factors included buying a one-way ticket on the day of travel, paying cash, and not checking a bag, drawing a complaint from Mr. Magaw.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We gave away three or four or five major elements&#39;&#39; of how security officials decide which passengers to scrutinize, Mr. Magaw said in remarks to reporters after speaking at the Transportation Research Board annual meeting here. &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve got to quit doing that.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You don&#39;t stop talking, but you stop being so specific,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Never again will you have a terrorist paying cash for a ticket on the same day, and not checking luggage,&#39;&#39; Mr. Magaw said.</p> <p>In his speech, he said, &#39;&#39;We need to find a way that the American public will find that we&#39;re doing what is constitutional and what they would want us to do, but at the same time, not give away all of these things.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Appearing on the same panel, Michael Jackson, the deputy transportation secretary, said that his department may also have been too free with information about hazardous materials in transit. By federal regulation, each such shipment must carry a placard, indicating its contents. The key for interpreting the placards is publicly available.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;That&#39;s an advertisement to the world, that&#39;s quite visible, about what&#39;s inside those containers,&#39;&#39; Mr. Jackson said. The logic before Sept. 11 was that in case of accident, the police or firefighters would need to know what was inside. But, he added, &#39;&#39;we are looking with different eyes today at that particular issue.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A NATION CHALLENGED: AIRPORT SECURITY</p>
350875>Oil Outlook Is More Confused Than Usual Unusual complications in predicting oil supply and demand - including uncertainty about the economies of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and the effects of the environmental movement - are making producers reluctant to invest in new wells and pipelines, experts at an international conference here say.  <p>The reluctance comes even as spare capacity is rapidly disappearing and as many producers appear eager to avoid the kind of capacity shortage that has twice caused convulsions in the oil markets in the last two decades.</p> <p>Fewer new investments in production capacity could result in shortages and price increases, and eventually crash development of new capacity that would then depress prices, the experts said.</p> <p>Elaborating on the increased difficulty of making investment decisions based on predictions about supply and demand, Thad Grundy Jr., a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Energy, said, &#39;&#39;It&#39;s always been a moving target, but there are so many variables now.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>William L. Liscom, publisher of Energy Listener, a newsletter, cited a prediction by a Chevron Corporation economist at the conference that oil prices would vary between $15 and $25 in the rest of the decade, a huge range. &#39;&#39;The only certainty is it&#39;s going to be volatile,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;That&#39;s going to bring a lot of investment to a halt.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I&#39;m not sure who is going to put money into Algeria or Nigeria on the basis of those prices,&#39;&#39; he added.</p> <p>Experts say they cannot even tell whether some of the factors causing uncertainty would raise or lower demand. The increased emphasis on the environment, for example, could bring new requirements for efficiency and conservation, meaning less demand, but also a call for cleaner fuels, which require more crude oil to produce. Similarly, the opening of Eastern Europe to the West could bring economic stimulus or an economic slump.</p> <p>Another pending change, the restructuring of the Soviet economy, could also raise or lower the demand for oil, depending on the country&#39;s economic progress, and raise or lower the worldwide supply of oil. The Soviet Union is the world&#39;s largest producer of oil and gas and the third-largest producer of coal, and small changes in the health of those industries could be reflected quickly in Soviet exports of fuels.</p> <p>Internal upheavals threaten Soviet production, experts say, as do pressures to invest in the production of consumer goods instead of oil and gas. Domestic demand could also grow. But both the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe could consume less because of efforts at modernization or efficiency or because of recessions brought on by the restructurings.</p> <p>Technical changes also loom, in the long term at least. &#39;&#39;Superconductivity is a huge and present threat to oil demand in the future,&#39;&#39; said Charles T. Maxwell, vice chairman of C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., although he said the threat was probably 20 to 25 years away. The development of superconductive materials, which have vastly lower resistance to electricity, would allow more efficient energy use.</p> <p>Other changes will come sooner, in Europe and East Asia, he said. He cited co-generation, the burning of fuel to obtain not only electricity but also industrial steam, lowering fuel requirements.</p> <p>Significant progress in solar cells would make them more suitable for displacing oil for electricity generation late in this decade, he added. Current solar cells would be a feasible replacement for oil priced at $60 to $100 a barrel, he said, and that range is falling fast as the cells are improved. And many experts expect the average price of oil, now under $20 a barrel, to rise.</p> <p>Oil prices tend to respond rapidly to very small shortages or surpluses. How close the world is to shortage is not clear, as several conference participants noted, because the capacity to produce and even the actual amount produced are often unclear. But a steady growth in worldwide demand in recent years, combined with a precipitous decline in production in the United States and other non-OPEC producers, appears to have put about 82 percent of OPEC&#39;s capacity in service.</p> <p>The conference was sponsored by the International Research Center for Energy and Economic Development, an autonomous research center at the University of Colorado.</p>
303045>Energy Dept. Found Paying Fees Of Lawyers Fighting U.S. Fines The General Accounting Office has found that the Department of Energy, which routinely pays all environmental fines and other expenses incurred by its contractors, has sometimes allowed those contractors to run up legal bills fighting the fines that are larger than the fines themselves.  <p>In addition, the department has given generous bonuses to the contractors even while they were incurring the fines, the accounting office says in a new report.</p> <p>The report by the G.A.O., the investigative arm of Congress, was made public yesterday at a House subcommittee hearing in Washington at which officials of the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency disagreed on whether the department should reimburse the contractors for fines.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The contractor should be held accountable in the same manner and to the same extent as an operator of a private facility,&#39;&#39; said Chritian B. Holmes, an acting assistant administrator of the environmental agency. Policy Is Defended</p> <p>But Steven A. Wakefield, the Energy Department&#39;s general counsel, said that if the contractors were liable for fines, the Government might have to pay them higher fees to keep them from dropping their contracts to run the nation&#39;s nuclear bomb factories.</p> <p>The two men testified before the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Transportation and Hazardous Materials. The G.A.O. report was prepared at the request of Representatives Thomas A. Luken, Democrat of Ohio, the subcommittee chairman; John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the full committee, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon.</p> <p>Mr. Wyden has introduced a bill that would prohibit the Government from reimbursing contractors for fines, penalties or legal fees if the violation was the fault of the contractor and not the Energy Department itself.</p> <p>Since the fines are paid to the Government, they are merely a transfer between Government accounts and not a cost to taxpayers. But Mr. Wyden said in a telephone interview that because the department pays not only the fines but also the legal bills incurred fighting them, &#39;&#39;Every time the Government fines a contractor, the taxpayer actually ends up losing money in the process.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In two cases studied by the auditors, the Department of Energy reimbursed contractors for $295,000 in penalties and $528,600 more in legal costs. NLO Inc., a subsidiary of NL Industries, was fined $275,000 for operations at the Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald, Ohio, and the University of California was fined $20,000 for operations at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Fines Routinely Contested</p> <p>The penalties are called &#39;&#39;settlement costs&#39;&#39; and not fines, at the insistence of the Energy Department, which maintains that it is not subject to fines. The department&#39;s contractors routinely contest the fines.</p>
1544511>Honoring the Centennial of Flight With Flight A replica of the Wright brothers&#39; 1903 Flyer will try to take off at 10:35 a.m. tomorrow from the original site, 100 years to the minute after the original. If the wind is not too fast and not too slow, and everything else cooperates, the airplane will hop the same 120 feet, with President Bush and thousands of others gathered to watch on the beach at Kill Devil Hills, N.C. Or, the replica may re-enact one of the Wright Brothers&#39; crashes, as it did on Nov. 25. The organizers of the event have made clear that the airplane is barely flyable.  <p>That is a good thing, said Seth Shulman, an aviation historian. &#39;&#39;It is wonderful and lovely and appropriate that it&#39;s going to be difficult to do the re-enactment. What better way to commemorate what a risky proposition this was.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Christian Markow, a spokesman for the First Flight Centennial Celebration, said that either success or failure would &#39;&#39;show how difficult achieving flight in the very beginning really was.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Ken W. Hyde, the president of the Wright Experience, the company that reverse-engineered the replica from old photos and documents, said he was confident. The reproduction crashed once, it is true, but that crash told his team more about the plane than the Wrights themselves may have known, he said. The Flyer was swiftly repaired and has since flown successfully twice.</p> <p>The pilot, however, will wear a helmet and elbow and kneepads like the ones worn by skateboarders. That will probably be enough if there is another crash like the last one, from an altitude of four feet, at a speed over the ground of 8 miles an hour.</p> <p>The re-creation has fabric spread over wooden ribs, braced with wire, just like the original. But it also carries a 16-channel black box, which last month detailed a stunning secret about the Flyer&#39;s &#39;&#39;flight envelope,&#39;&#39; the conditions under which it can stay airborne. The plane, Mr. Hyde said, must fly through the air at about 27 miles an hour, at the slowest, to generate enough lift to keep its mass of about 605 pounds, plus pilot, in the air. But, he said, it cannot exceed 32 m.p.h., or its nose pitches up or down uncontrollably.</p> <p>In contrast, in a single-engine private plane, the difference between top speed and minimum speed is typically 80 m.p.h. or more.</p> <p>A 5 m.p.h. range would be a challenge for any pilot. But adding to the Flyer&#39;s marginality is its 12-horsepower engine. That is too weak to reach an airspeed of 27 m.p.h. unassisted by nature. Like all the planes that followed, it does best taking off into the wind, but unlike most others, it cannot take off at all unless there is a wind to launch into. But not too much wind; if the gusts get up above 25 m.p.h. the pilot cannot reduce engine power as would be done in a modern airplane. The engine has no throttle.</p> <p>The wind speed is so critical that the organizers have installed three monitors in the area. One feeds a Web page, www.digiwx-kittyhawk .com/, so that people in distant cities can see whether the Flyer can fly. Organizers would like about 12 to 17 m.p.h. of steady wind. Big gusts could force cancellation.</p> <p>The Wrights had it easier, Mr. Hyde said. Since their time, trees and buildings have disrupted the wind flow, making flight harder.</p> <p>Not that it was easy for Orville and Wilbur, whose difficulties included having to teach themselves to fly. In contrast, Mr. Hyde is a retired American Airlines pilot with more than 35,000 hours of flying; the others who have trained on the recreated flyer are also highly experienced. But Mr. Hyde said that the Flyer was so different that &#39;&#39;it doesn&#39;t pay to have any flight experience.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Pilots or armchair historians of flight who would like to know how it feels to fly the Flyer, but won&#39;t get the chance, can try the February 2003 edition of Microsoft&#39;s Flight Simulator, which includes the Flyer and other historic planes.</p> <p>The Wrights did not invent the idea of powered flight, and they and others had experimented with pitch control in gliders. What Orville and Wilbur invented -- or at least were lucky enough get into the air first -- was a system of lateral control. The ability to change the angle of the wings allowed the plane to be brought back to a wings-level attitude if upset by a gust, and to bank when wanted, an essential component of being able to turn.</p> <p>Modern airplanes do this with ailerons, hinged sections of the wing that move up and down, creating extra lift on one side and less lift on the other. The Flyer used wing warping, an idea that is said to have come to the brothers when one of them was flexing a box in his hands.</p> <p>Mr. Shulman pointed out in his book &#39;&#39;Unlocking the Sky,&#39;&#39; a biography of a Wright competitor, Glenn Hammond Curtiss, that wing warping quickly went out of style, in favor of the aileron. Some historians see wing warping as an elegant solution to the problem at hand, but the airplane that flew at Kitty Hawk did not have enough lateral control to fly in a circle; that came in the 1905 version, historians say.</p> <p>The Flyer had some characteristics that had nothing to do with technological advancement, and they made life more difficult.</p> <p>Phil Scott, an aviation historian, pointed to the orientation of the wings. When modern airplanes fly, for the most part, the wing tips are higher than the wings where they attach to the body, a configuration that adds stability by putting the heaviest part, the fuselage, at the bottom. The Flyer is the other way around, he said.</p> <p>Mr. Scott, author of a recent book on planes that flew badly or not at all, &#39;&#39;The Wrong Stuff?,&#39;&#39; said another simple problem with the Flyer was its short length. The 1903 flyer was just 21 feet 1 inch long, with a wingspan of 40 feet 4 inches. The 1905 version, he pointed out, was seven feet longer, and just five inches wider. That helped with pitch control, he said.</p> <p>Mr. Hyde, who also built a Wright Model B, the 1911 airplane, found another problem. He said the Wrights&#39; early planes also had a tendency to slide sideways. &#39;&#39;Modern airplanes don&#39;t do that,&#39;&#39; he said. The reasons have to do with low forward speed and the shape of the wing, he said.</p> <p>If the reproduction is faithful to the original, historians say, it will not do brilliantly tomorrow. Without detracting from the Wrights&#39; achievement, many are circumspect about the quality of the early product.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It certainly wasn&#39;t a perfect aircraft, by any means,&#39;&#39; Mr. Scott said. &#39;&#39;It did it marginally well.&#39;&#39;</p>
1500632>Shuttle Board Determines Likely Site of Fatal Damage The Columbia Accident Investigation Board today located within inches the spot on the shuttle&#39;s left wing that was damaged by foam on liftoff on Jan. 16 and said the wing came apart at that point 16 days later in the shuttle&#39;s re-entry from space. The spot, the board said, was on the eighth of 22 panels on the leading edge of the wing, probably on its lower side.  <p>Two board members described the evidence for fatal damage at Panel 8 as &#39;&#39;compelling.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;ve been trying to line up all the Swiss cheese holes,&#39;&#39; one board member, Roger E. Tetrault, said, elaborating on the evidence. &#39;&#39;I think those holes have lined up pretty good.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Tetrault also said that foam was &#39;&#39;the most probable cause&#39;&#39; of the disintegration of the shuttle, adding that it was the first time he had made such a statement.</p> <p>While the board has not made any formal finding yet, and the chairman said its 13 members would not agree on what word to use to describe their degree of certainty about the cause of the accident, members said the damage caused by foam was clear from several independent sources, including the debris from the crash, pictures from liftoff, the pattern of data loss on re-entry and a series of laboratory tests still being performed.</p> <p>Panel 8, which is U-shaped, is about 28 inches wide and 25 inches high on each side. On the Columbia, it was the widest of the panels and was not supported in the middle. It has a complex shape because the wing of the V-winged orbiter begins to swing away from the fuselage there.</p> <p>One piece of evidence supporting Panel 8 as the site of the damage is that so much of the metal hardware behind the panel is missing because the hardware had melted and re-solidified. The metal hardware appears to be intact on adjacent pieces.</p> <p>In addition, pieces of the panel were found over a large area, indicating that part of it broke off with the left wing, which was found generally to the west of the rest of the wreckage, while part of it stayed with the main body of the shuttle until its final breakup over Texas.</p> <p>But board members have been able to draw only limited conclusions based on the location of shuttle debris. All the pieces, including those that came off in chunks and then broke up again on their way down, flew with a different glide path because each had its own ratio of lift to mass.</p> <p>As a result, the order in which pieces were found under the shuttle&#39;s path does not precisely coincide with their order of breaking off the orbiter.</p> <p>Investigators have given up trying to determine precisely how each part of the debris flew.</p> <p>As they near the completion of their report, expected in about a month, the investigators are still finding other areas that puzzle them. They determined, for example, that foam fell from a connector to the external fuel tank in seven launchings. Five of those involved the Columbia, and a sixth occurred with the Challenger, which exploded shortly after liftoff in 1986. The seventh was the Atlantis, three months before the Columbia&#39;s fatal launching.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I wish I had an answer for that,&#39;&#39; said Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., the board chairman.</p> <p>Admiral Gehman said investigators had looked without success at the names of the technicians who made those parts, the humidity when they were fabricated in a Louisiana factory and the angles at which the shuttles were sent into orbit, among other factors.</p> <p>It was clear today that other factors might never be explained. For example, Scott Hubbard, a board member, described in a briefing today tests that are now being carried out at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, where technicians are using a gun with a 30-foot barrel to fire pieces of foam at a test structure at about 500 miles an hour.</p> <p>In recent tests, they have varied the part of the block of foam that hits the wing -- sometimes using a corner and sometimes an edge -- and have found that this makes a substantial difference in the way that the wing panels are damaged.</p> <p>They estimate that during the launching, the debris was rotating about 18 times a second, so they have no idea how it hit.</p> <p>The investigators are planning a test early next month using the same kind of material, reinforced carbon carbon, that was on the leading edge of the Columbia&#39;s wing. In fact, some of it will be actual shuttle material, borrowed from the shuttle Discovery because carbon carbon parts are in short supply.</p> <p>Replacing the panel taken from the Discovery will take about six months, Admiral Gehman said, a time frame that meshes with the earliest time that NASA is likely to fly a shuttle again.</p> <p>As it continues to deal with other material from the Columbia&#39;s wreckage, NASA today released video images and photographs of the crew salvaged from the 85,000 pounds of debris found.</p> <p>Also today, Admiral Gehman laid out other recommendations the board is likely to make to NASA. One is a reduction in foam shedding, especially of large pieces, and another focuses on the orbiter&#39;s ability to withstand hits. A third centers on the ability to repair the orbiter in space.</p> <p>Admiral Gehman said that he favored the creation of an escape system for the crews but that the board would not delve into that area.</p> <p>In addition, Admiral Gehman said his board would recommend that NASA more urgently pursue the successor to the shuttle. NASA should be further along with a design, he said, but now is simply circulating conceptual diagrams.</p>
582101>Nuclear-Plant Debate: Fix or Retire The corrosion problem that led the Portland General Electric Company to retire its Trojan nuclear plant late Monday will affect more reactors as the years go by, experts say. And uncertainty about how the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will handle the problem, an issue the utility cited in its decision, could very quickly bring reactor owners to a painful decision: whether to make expensive repairs, or retire their plants, or cut their power ratings. Corrosion in Tubes At the Rainier, Ore., plant, thousands of thin-walled metal tubes inside a heat exchanger called a steam generator had corroded. The N.R.C., which generally requires that such tubes be plugged or lined with a metal sleeve if a crack reaches 40 percent of the thickness of the tube wall, had permitted the company to use a relaxed standard. It has given similar permission to reactors in Michigan, Alabama and South Carolina.  <p>But use of the relaxed standard has been increasingly controversial since November, when the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Washington safety group, released an internal N.R.C. document that it had obtained, theorizing that use of the standard made Trojan far more dangerous. The document, an official dissent by a staff engineer at the N.R.C., said that it raised the chance of catastrophic accident to 3 chances in 100 per year of reactor operation, compared with a commission safety goal of one in one million.</p> <p>Portland General had planned since August to retire Trojan in four years, but said Monday that because of the disagreement within the N.R.C., it would not reopen the plant, which was shut early last month but had been made ready to run again.</p> <p>It disclosed the decision after the stock market had closed. Yesterday, Portland General&#39;s shares fell $1.375, to $17, on the New York Stock Exchange. N.R.C. Backs New Standard</p> <p>Yesterday, officials of the N.R.C. stressed that the document reflected one engineer&#39;s opinion and that the two main regulatory offices within the commission, the office of nuclear reactor regulation and the office of research, agreed with the use of the new standard. But the dissent prepared by the engineer has been sent to the utilities for comment, said James E. Richardson, head of the commission&#39;s divison of engineering.</p> <p>The original criteria, he said, were developed 30 years ago for a problem called &quot;wastage,&quot; in which the tubes were made thinner in large areas. That problem has been controlled, he said, but now plants are finding cracking, which the old standard is not designed to cover.</p> <p>But the commission has classified the question of when a tube must be repaired or plugged as a safety issue with broad applicability, and the Union of Concerned Scientists has publicly asked the commission to explain to the public why the relaxed standard is adequate, or to shut the plants that are using it.</p> <p>If the commission eventually drops the looser standard, the result will be to make plant owners decide promptly whether to replace the steam generators or retire their plants. Portland General decided in August that at $200 million, the bill for replacement was too high, and that it would limp along with the old steam generators until they wore out, which it expected to happen in 1996. Yesterday morning, at an analyst meeting in New York, a company official said that use of the stricter standard would cost his company another $20 million a year, which was too much. Analyst View</p> <p>Two analysts in the audience said in interviews later that they were surprised that Portland General&#39;s view could have changed so quickly since August. One, citing the N.R.C.&#39;s contention that there was no short-term plan to require stricter standards, speculated that the utility had simply changed its mind and was looking for a reason to justify its announcement.</p> <p>But Portland General&#39;s explanation resembles the one given by owners of another plant, Yankee Rowe, in Rowe, Mass., who voted to shut their plant last year. In both cases, a reactor was approaching the end of its lifetime, and the operators said the N.R.C. had not set up a clear standard for them to meet in demonstrating that the plants were safe to operate.</p> <p>COMPANY NEWS</p>
760505>Diesel Link To Cancers In Humans Is Doubted DIESEL exhaust probably does not cause cancer in humans, at least not at the concentrations that are common on the streets, according to a re-analysis of previous studies by the Health Effects Institute, an independent scientific organization financed by the Environmental Protection Agency and private industry. A study released yesterday by the institute faults conclusions from animal and human studies. &quot;This study raises questions about how closely we can link diesel exhaust to cancer for most people in the United States,&quot; said Daniel S. Greenbaum, the institute&#39;s president.  <p>But he added that the particles in the exhaust, combined with particles from other sources, might cause deaths by aggravating other diseases, like chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. Other researchers have recently reported elevated death rates in counties with high particulate levels, from diesel engines and other sources, and the institute is re-analyzing that data.</p> <p>The environmental agency is in the middle of a major campaign to reduce diesel pollution. In late 1993 the Federal Government cut the amount of sulfur allowed in diesel fuel to no more than five one-hundredths of 1 percent, from one-half of 1 percent. And it instituted tougher standards on new diesel engines, beginning in the late 1980&#39;s, although these will take time to show much effect, experts say, because older diesels will be on the road for years to come, and because the number of diesel engines is growing.</p> <p>Much of the current consensus about the cancer-causing effects of diesel emissions is based on animal studies. But only rats show the effect; hamsters do not and the &quot;the results in mice are equivocal,&quot; the institute noted. The cancers in rats occur when they are exposed to particulates at the rate of 2,000 to 10,000 micrograms per cubic meter, the study said, and the cause may be that the concentration is so high that it overwhelms their ability to clear their lungs. Thus there may be a threshold, or minimum concentration, below which there is no effect, the institute said.</p> <p>In comparison, another part of the institute&#39;s study found that in Los Angeles, the highest monthly average values for diesel particulates were about 10 micrograms per cubic meter. Mr. Greenbaum said in a telephone interview that in New York, where buses and trucks sometimes crowd into canyon-like avenues, studies not yet published show values that are about the same or only slightly higher, and thus still likely about one two-hundredth of the levels used in rat tests. In general, the institute said, average atmospheric concentrations are 1 to 10 micrograms per cubic meter.</p> <p>Dr. Gareth Green, associate dean of education at the Harvard School of Public Health and chairman of a study committee convened by the institute, said, &quot;The existing data do not support the idea that the high levels of diesel particles, which appear to cause tumors in rats, would cause similar effects at the levels to which most people are exposed.&quot; He added, though, that &quot;we could not exclude the possibility that some of the chemicals attached to the diesel particle may play a role in causing cancer.&quot; The particles are extremely small, so they can penetrate deeply into the lung, and they carry hundreds of chemicals.</p> <p>Studies in humans found that those with an occupational exposure to diesel smoke had lung cancer rates 20 to 50 percent higher than other workers, but none of the studies were precise about the level of exposures, the institute found. &quot;Most investigators classified exposure on the basis of work histories reported by the subjects or their next of kin, or by retirement records,&quot; the study found.</p>
343622>Better Ways to Make Electricity The gas turbine, which has been called the &#39;&#39;neglected stepsister&#39;&#39; of electricity-generating equipment, is becoming the utility industry&#39;s main hope for the next decade.  <p>Because of improvements in design and materials, gas turbines, which have traditionally gulped premium fuel in large amounts, are now among the most efficient of electricity-generating technologies. The latest models produce more energy per unit of fuel than typical utility boilers. And just around the corner, experts say, are improvements that will let them overcome a voracious appetite for costly natural gas and light fuel oil to run instead on cheaper, lower-quality fuels like coal, agricultural waste and even sewage sludge, with very small emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.</p> <p>And if the fuel is wood from forests that are replanted, the technology does not contribute to the accumulation of &#39;&#39;greenhouse&#39;&#39; gases that are thought to cause global warming, because the new trees will absorb the amount of carbon dioxide released in the burning of the trees that came before them. If agricultural waste or sludge is used, electricity can be obtained from wastes that would have produced carbon dioxide anyway as they decay.</p> <p>But gas turbines are being snapped up by electric companies mostly for another reason. Electricity demand is growing by fits and starts, making it risky to build the huge generating stations that were common in the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s. Gas turbines can be installed on relatively short notice in sizes that are the electric company&#39;s version of the single-serving convenience pack. &#39;&#39;The nature of the technology lends itself very well to the current situation of the industry,&#39;&#39; said Robert C. Porter, a spokesman for the Department of Energy, which is backing research on making fuel for gas turbines.</p> <p>&#39;What Everyone&#39;s Doing&#39;</p> <p>Liz Hannon, president of the Utility Data Institute, a Washington information company, said, &#39;&#39;This is what everyone&#39;s doing to cut lead time.&#39;&#39; Her company calculates that of the 40,000 megawatts of electric capacity scheduled to come into service in this decade, 27 percent will be from gas turbines or combination gas and steam turbines, up sharply from earlier years.</p> <p>General Electric, Asea Brown Boveri and Kraftwerk are the major producers of large gas turbines.</p> <p>A turbine is essentially the opposite of a propeller, using its blades to capture the energy of passing steam or gases to spin a shaft, which turns a generator and makes electricity. Most gas turbines are fueled with natural gas, but many run on fuel oil when gas is in peak demand, and can operate on anything that provides a clean gas.</p> <p>Gas turbines are not the norm; most utility turbines run on steam, which is made by burning natural gas, oil or coal in a boiler, or by splitting uranium in a nuclear reactor.</p> <p>Steam-turbine plants have a thermal efficiency of about 33 percent; that is, they capture and convert to electricity about one-third of the energy value in their fuel. Older gas turbines have a thermal efficiency of only about 25 percent. That means that a quantity of gas that would produce four kilowatt-hours when run through a boiler to drive a steam-turbine plant will give only three in a gas-turbine plant. Cheap to build but expensive to run, the gas-turbine plants have been used mostly as &#39;&#39;peaking&#39;&#39; plants to meet demand on the hottest or coldest days of the year when steam-turbine plants cannot.</p> <p>Raising Efficiency</p> <p>But the Pentagon and the airlines have been steadily pushing gas-turbine technology, building jet engines that run at higher temperatures and pressures and thus at higher efficiency. As those engines are adapted for use in generating electricity, engineers have achieved efficiencies of 40 percent.</p> <p>Some turbines adapted from aircraft reach such levels through the gas turbine itself. Some larger industrial turbines do this in a &#39;&#39;combined cycle&#39;&#39; mode, using the exhaust gases from the turbine to boil water into steam, which is then used in a steam turbine. So the fuel that gave four kilowatt-hours in a conventional steam-turbine plant now gives five in the gas-turbine or gas-steam plant.</p> <p>Another variation is to boil water with the exhaust gases and inject some of the steam back into the gas turbine, so it is running on a combination of gases and steam. The largest of these steam-injection gas turbines, derived from the jet engine used in the Boeing 747, the DC-10 Series 30 and the Airbus 300, runs at 40 percent efficiency when operated at peak power, 51 megawatts, said Robert H. Williams, a senior research scientist at Princeton University&#39;s Center for Energy and Environmental Studies.</p> <p>Cost Reduced Sharply</p> <p>That is one-twentieth the size of a large nuclear plant, and roughly one-tenth the capital cost per kilowatt of capacity. The steam-injected turbine costs about $30 million, or $600 per kilowatt; nuclear plants like Seabrook and Shoreham cost more than $5,000 per kilowatt.</p> <p>The next step, Mr. Williams said, is a steam-injected turbine with a specially cooled compressor, which could allow operation at yet higher temperatures. A model with 47 percent thermal efficiency could be commercialized in three to five years, he said, and may indeed be developed because combustion under those circumstances produces very little nitrogen oxide, a major pollutant.</p> <p>Some utility executives are wary, however, after the experience of the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s, in which fuel oil varied widely in price and was sometimes unavailable, and natural gas use was curtailed because of fears that supplies were dwindling. Utilities do not like investing in long-lived plants that run on a fuel that may be unavailable in a few years. Coal, while it presents environmental problems, is likely to stay cheap and plentiful.</p> <p>Ubiquitous Combustible Gases</p> <p>But engineers know that almost any hydrocarbon material, if properly treated, will give off combustible gases that can be used in a turbine. From 1984 to 1989, Mr. Porter&#39;s department subsidized operation of a coal gasification plant in Daggett, Calif. Coal there was mixed with steam at high temperature, producing carbon monoxide and hydrogen.</p> <p>The plant converted 1,000 tons of coal a day and produced 120 megawatts of electricity, at a price that its owner, Texaco Inc., says is competitive with other clean-coal technologies. But Texaco would like to reopen the plant, using a mixture of coal, which is cheap, and sewage sludge, which is better than free; municipalities will pay to have it hauled away.</p> <p>The bane of coal is sulfur, a main cause of acid rain, and removing it from boiler smoke in conventional plants is expensive. But removing the sulfur, in the form of hydrogen sulfide, before the gas was burned proved much easier, in part because the volume of gas was smaller.</p> <p>The coal gasification process has a 95 to 99 percent reduction in sulfur compared with a plant with no scrubbers; a moderate increase in kilowatt-hours produced per ton of coal, and a capital cost of $1,100 to $1,300 per kilowatt.</p> <p>The Department of Energy thinks it is roughly comparable to a conventional coal plant with scrubbers, and will gain broad acceptance if rising natural gas prices jump or increased environmental regulation makes it advisable. Even now, however, expectation of the technology is making owners of gas turbines believe their plants have a life beyond natural gas and oil.</p> <p>But coal is not the ultimate fuel. Mr. Williams said that for the long term the turbines should run on gasified wood or agricultural wastes. With turbines of relatively modest size, he said, fuel requirements could be met within a relatively small area, cutting transportation costs of bulky fuel. And in the third world, where electric demand is increasing, the technology would use native fuel.</p> <p>BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
1515781>Retold Facts Are Likely In Report On Shuttle Unlike a report on a plane crash or a nuclear meltdown, the report of the board investigating the loss of the space shuttle Columbia, due to be released on Tuesday morning, is likely to hold few revelations about the physical details of the disaster. But for sociologists, students of management and people who wonder how a group of rocket scientists could be less competent collectively than they are individually, it may prove illuminating.  <p>The physical details will not make the report a page turner or, perhaps, a page clicker, because most readers will find it on the Web. The 13-member board, which began work just after the shuttle broke apart on Feb. 1, has already laid out many of the points.</p> <p>Still, the report may prove notable for its findings about management failings at NASA -- and the language in which it delivers them. Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., who is chairman of the accident board, has already said its assessment could be harsh.</p> <p>Moreover, the board has kept some details to itself, including critical questions about personal interactions that form the background of the disaster. Among the ones that could make interesting reading are e-mail messages, both within NASA and between the space agency and outside agencies, about whether to obtain spy satellite images of the shuttle while it was in orbit.</p> <p>That was an idea favored by scattered experts in the agency but quashed at the top. The board&#39;s hundreds of interviews with participants in the space program would have presumably allowed a clear chronology of decisions and orders on that question.</p> <p>The significance of failing to obtain the images is not publicly clear in advance of the report&#39;s release. But the board is clearly interested in the question. One of the few times that it ordered NASA engineers to pursue a specific line of inquiry was over the question of a rescue. The board asked the agency to assume that damage to the shuttle was known and to figure out whether it could have been repaired in orbit or made to rendezvous with another shuttle.</p> <p>That could be a prelude to a deeper analysis about why NASA made so little effort during the 16-day mission to look at the shuttle for damage.</p> <p>Another question is to what degree the report will single out individuals as failing to prevent the disaster. Asked whether the report is detailed enough to form the basis for a fault-finding exercise like a military court-martial, a spokeswoman for the board, Laura J. Brown, said, &#39;&#39;That is certainly not the intent.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>It is clear that the board&#39;s leaders decided to follow a different kind of military model, the one called a mishap investigation. Besides Admiral Gehman, who is retired, the members include an active-duty rear admiral and three Air Force generals. All are accustomed to investigations that establish the causes of accidents without laying the groundwork for prosecution.</p> <p>As a result, board members have taken hundreds of statements that are &#39;&#39;privileged,&#39;&#39; meaning that the speakers&#39; identities are secret. The document is highly unlikely to read with the specificity or tone of an indictment. But that does not preclude the idea that a careful reader could draw conclusions about who had made wrong decisions during the flight and before.</p> <p>The report may result in further housecleaning at NASA, where there has already been significant turnover. It could also provide fodder for hearings that Congress plans to start when it returns next month.</p> <p>Over the longer term, many effects of the report are likely to be on NASA&#39;s &#39;&#39;culture,&#39;&#39; that bundle of attitudes, relationships and world views that make up the organization. Its top officials have repeatedly promised to follow every recommendation, even appointing a commission to review their performance in doing so. But the commission members have pointed out that their job will be completed before NASA could hope to reform its culture, leaving open the question of who will write the epilogue.</p> <p>The Gehman board has said for months that it will divide its recommendations into two groups, those that have to be accomplished before the first post-Columbia flight, presumably next spring, and those that should be accomplished later. How the board divides those recommendations and what it says about the need for culture change is another area where readers could be surprised.</p>
1564890>U.S. Presses States for Strict Seat Belt Laws After six years, efforts to persuade states to enact tougher seat belt laws have stalled, prompting the federal government to step up its lobbying to have such bills passed by state legislatures. So far, 20 states have passed primary seat belt laws that let police officers pull over motorists and ticket them for not wearing a seat belt. An additional 29, including Florida, have secondary laws that permit the police to issue a ticket for seat belt violations only if they have first pulled the car over for some other reason. One state, New Hampshire, has no law mandating the use of seat belts by adults, though it does have a requirement for children.  <p>Federal officials estimate that if every state adopted the tougher primary law 1,400 lives would be saved annually, 200 of them in Florida.</p> <p>Federal highway safety officials put Florida at the top of their list for conversion, and on Thursday the Florida House of Representatives voted 80 to 39 to adopt a primary law. But its prospects are uncertain.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We want Florida bad,&#39;&#39; said Dr. Jeff Runge, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, who said the estimated number of lives that could be saved in Florida was larger than anywhere else. &#39;&#39;What else can they do as a legislature to save 200 lives a year?&#39;&#39; Dr. Runge said. &#39;&#39;Nothing else.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Norman Y. Mineta, the secretary of transportation, flew to Tallahassee on Thursday to urge members of the State Senate to pass the bill.</p> <p>But the Senate president, James E. King Jr., told reporters that the idea would &#39;&#39;get the same consideration in the Senate that it has gotten in years past: None.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Opponents of the tougher measure say seat belt use should be a matter of personal choice. And they say they are concerned that the tougher law would become a tool for racist police officers to harass minority drivers.</p> <p>Mr. King told reporters on Wednesday that he understood that Pennsylvania had recently switched to a primary law and determined that officers were using the law to harass members of a racial minority. &#39;&#39;The race there was Puerto Ricans,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Despite Mr. King&#39;s assertion, Pennsylvania has not enacted a primary seat belt law.</p> <p>Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said on Thursday that he favored a primary law because &#39;&#39;when you have primary enforcement you have greater usage,&#39;&#39; adding, &#39;&#39;that is also a statistic that is pretty clear.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The governor said he had spoken to Mr. King but not persuaded him.</p> <p>Some advocates of strengthening seat belt laws say race arguments are bogus. Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat, observed in a debate in Washington on the issue that a primary seat belt law was not required for the police to harass minority drivers. &#39;&#39;There are enough excuses for an offending police officer making stops based on race,&#39;&#39; Mr. Conyers said.</p> <p>The federal government&#39;s push for adoption of a primary seat belt law made little progress last year, adding only Illinois and Delaware. Massachusetts and Virginia defeated such bills.</p> <p>The use of seat belts nationally is estimated at 79 percent for front-seat passengers, but among states with belt laws, the figures run from 62 percent to 95 percent.</p> <p>Of the roughly 38,000 people who are killed in vehicles, about 1,400 would survive if the rate for using seat belts rose to 90 percent, according to the Transportation Department. States with primary laws show rates of use about 11 percentage points higher than states with secondary laws, according to the Transportation Department. Tens of thousands of serious injuries would be eliminated or made much less severe by wide seat belt use.</p> <p>Floridians use seat belts at a rate of 73 percent, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 6 percentage points below the national average, and 12 percentage points below neighboring Georgia, which has a primary law.</p> <p>Despite these statistics the issue remains a tough sell in some states.</p> <p>State Representative Jack T. Barraclough of Idaho, after hearing Mr. Mineta speak on the need for stronger seat belt laws at a gathering of state legislators in Washington in December, said, &#39;&#39;My heart and my knowledge say this is exactly the right thing to do.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;But we&#39;re dealing with independent states in the Rocky Mountains,&#39;&#39; Mr. Barraclough, a Republican, said. &#39;&#39;They hate to have things forced on them.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In 2003, the Legislature in Boise amended Idaho&#39;s secondary law to raise the fine for riding or driving unbelted to $10 from $5. &#39;&#39;Even that was a struggle,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The federal government is offering extra highway money to states that change to the primary seat belt law. Florida would get an additional $37 million under the budget proposed by President Bush in January.</p> <p>Mr. Mineta said he did not favor withholding ordinary highway aid. &#39;&#39;We don&#39;t want to short-change the states,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>But some people pushing for a toughening of the laws hope that perhaps the opponents will finally be won over by the thought that they could be saving lives.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They&#39;ve been holding it up for 20 years,&#39;&#39; said State Representative Irving Slosberg, a Democrat, who sponsored the Florida bill. Mr. Slosberg&#39;s 14-year-old daughter, Dori, who was not wearing a seat belt, was killed in a traffic accident eight years ago. &#39;&#39;They have to get tired of having the blood on their hands,&#39;&#39; he said.</p>
1318850>F.A.A. Says More Training Could Reduce Wiring Flaws Wiring problems on old planes, recognized as a hazard since the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 five years ago, are caused not by natural decay but by clumsy maintenance, bad equipment design and improper installation, the Federal Aviation Administration said today. As a result, the agency is calling for training technicians and engineers to avoid damaging the wiring, especially as the number of older jets rises.  <p>&#39;&#39;The phenomenon we originally thought that &#39;aging&#39; implied was the chemical degradation of an insulation blanket on a wire after 30 years in service,&#39;&#39; said John Hickey, director of the aircraft certification service at the aviation agency.</p> <p>But investigators looking at 20-year-old planes in service, and even older, retired aircraft, did not find that kind of deterioration, Mr. Hickey said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We found inadequate maintenance or repair, or contamination or other mechanical damage,&#39;&#39; he said. Wires could be damaged in work on adjacent equipment, he said, or after years of rubbing against something. Some of those problems could also affect younger airplanes, he said, and could make electrically controlled equipment fail in flight or cause smoke or fire.</p> <p>But the agency has no clear idea of how often wiring causes problems, because trouble reports in its database often describe the problem as being in the equipment powered or controlled by the wiring instead of in the wiring itself, officials said.</p> <p>The agency released a report today calling for new rules on wiring by the end of 2004. It has asked the airlines to make voluntary changes soon.</p> <p>More attention to wiring could turn out to be the government&#39;s main response to the causes of the crash of Flight 800, a 25-year-old Boeing 747 that exploded shortly after takeoff from Kennedy Airport, killing all 230 people aboard.</p> <p>The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the crash, said the cause was a spark that ignited fuel vapors in the mostly empty center fuel tank, but the board did not pinpoint what had caused the spark. It recommended several possible steps to eliminate ignition even if a spark is present, including filling empty space in tanks with inert gas.</p> <p>But last week a task force told an advisory committee appointed by the aviation agency that the inert-gas option was too expensive. The committee has not decided what to tell the agency, but the airline industry is not enthusiastic about the idea.</p> <p>Studying planes in service, experts found places where one power cable lay atop another, which could lead to a short circuit, and places where the wires were bent too tightly. There were also cases in which equipment had been installed in a plane without specific instructions about routing the wiring.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;When they went out to repair facilities for installation, five different repair facilities might have installed the wires five different ways,&#39;&#39; Mr. Hickey said. &#39;&#39;Some were very good, some were not so good.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Airline personnel, airplane designers and aviation agency inspectors all need more training, he said.</p>
146739>Tanker Owners Seeing End to an 8-Year Slump Tanker owners see signs that the eight-year-old slump in their industry is coming to an end, as the amount of surplus capacity and the number of tankers being scrapped fell in 1987 to their lowest levels of the 1980&#39;s.  <p>At the annual meeting of the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, known as Intertanko, experts said last week that they were counting on a growing demand for oil and increased exports from the Middle East to raise the demand for shipping.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We are hopefully emerging from the worst depression - and certainly the most protracted one - the world has ever known,&#39;&#39; James Davis, a merchant banker and chairman of the International Maritime Industries Forum, a trade group, told the convention on Friday. Fewer Tankers Scrapped</p> <p>According to Intertanko&#39;s 1987 annual report, distributed at the meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, the total of deadweight tons of tankers and combined tankers (which can carry liquid or bulk cargo) that were being dismantled and melted down to scrap metal fell to 7.5 million deadweight tons last year. That was half the 1986 figure of 15.2 million deadweight tons, and one-quarter the 1985 level of 29.3 million deadweight tons.</p> <p>In another hopeful sign for the industry, Intertanko also reported that the resale value of large tankers has been substantially above their scrap-metal value. The association, which is based in Oslo, said the trend began in early 1986.</p> <p>The oil tanker industry, always cyclical, expanded rapidly in the 1970&#39;s. &#39;&#39;The price of oil was up and demand was still going up,&#39;&#39; said Robert P. Burke, a shipping executive at Rand &amp; Company, a tanker company in Stamford, Conn., &#39;&#39;and everyone was projecting 7 or 8 percent growth in oil demand a year, into infinity. They stamped out tankers like license plates.&#39;&#39; Drilling Was Stimulated</p> <p>But the increase in oil prices also stimulated drilling in the North Sea, Alaska, and the continental United States, and the result was that less oil had to be transported over long distances.</p> <p>Oil transport is measured in ton-miles; one ton of oil (about 6.5 barrels or 270 gallons) carried one mile is one ton-mile. The number of ton-miles in 1987 was 5.9 trillion, about the same as in 1986, but little more than half the 1978 level, according to Intertanko.</p> <p>The amount of oil moved per ton of available shipping capacity, a measure of efficiency, is down by 50 percent since 1978, according to the organization. Part of the reason is that 11.2 million deadweight tons of tankerage was still unused at the end of last year, and another 7.5 million tons was in use as floating storage. Steaming at Slow Speed</p> <p>In addition, many tankers are &#39;&#39;slow steaming,&#39;&#39; or traveling at less than maximum speed. The organization, saying that slow steaming is hiding additional spare capacity, warned that this was not a good time to build new tankers.</p> <p>Industry experts said that traveling at reduced speed uses less fuel, which saves money when tanker charter rates are low, and that the owners of the oil might be speculating that prices would be higher by the time the cargo reaches port.</p> <p>Uncertainty in oil prices may help the industry, some experts said. &#39;&#39;If oil is selling in the Iranian gulf at $13 a barrel, and traders think they can sell it in Papau New Guinea for $15, they will need tankers to ship it there,&#39;&#39; said Katarina Thome, director of Thome &amp; Company, a Singapore company that owns and manages tankers. &#39;&#39;If they need tankers, shipping rates will go up,&#39;&#39; she said.</p> <p>The tanker owners are also encouraged by the increasing age of the tanker fleet. &#39;&#39;By 1990, 75 percent of the tankers will be more than 15 years old,&#39;&#39; said Odd Veierod, general manager of Jorgen Jahre Shipping of Sandefjord, Norway.</p>
290080>Searching for Incentives To Entice Polluters As Congress last week discussed the renewal of the Clean Air Act, it wrestled with expanded use of an unusual concept in pollution control: letting industries buy and sell the right to emit pollutants, with companies deciding among themselves how to share the work that the Government wants done. Under President Bush&#39;s proposal, this flexibility would extend to automobiles.  <p>As Congress last week discussed the renewal of the Clean Air Act, it wrestled with expanded use of an unusual concept in pollution control: letting industries buy and sell the right to emit pollutants, with companies deciding among themselves how to share the work that the Government wants done. Under President Bush&#39;s proposal, this flexibility would extend to automobiles. The law would specify the number of &#39;&#39;alternative fuel&#39;&#39; cars but would not say what fuel or precisely which companies would make them or the fuels.</p> <p>Industry generally favors these trading programs, saying they lead to greater economic efficiency. But environmentalists warn of pitfalls that will make the cleanup program less effective.</p> <p>Last week Charles J. DiBona, the president of the American Petroleum Institute and an economist, and David G. Hawkins, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who was the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s Assistant Administrator for Air, Noise and Radiation from 1977 to 1981, met to debate the merits of pollution trading. Matthew L. Wald of The New York Times moderated.</p> <p>Mr. DiBona: We now spend on the order of $100 million per year, or about 2 percent of G.N.P, on environmental controls. In the future the cost will undoubtedly rise, perhaps quickly. If the Europeans and Asians should utilize incentive approaches to protect their environments while we do not, our industries will be at a competitive disadvantage. While there is not much experience with incentive systems, they have in some cases provided substantial economies, and many academic studies show large potential economies.</p> <p>Mr. Hawkins: In some circumstances the environmental community feels comfortable with incentive systems based on trading the right to pollute. An example is the President&#39;s proposal on the trading of sulfur dioxide emission allowances for acid rain control. A reduction somewhere in the market is fungible with a reduction elsewhere. It does not involve trading one individual&#39;s right to a clean environment against another&#39;s right to a clean environment. And the pollutants, particularly sulfur dioxide, can be accurately monitored.</p> <p>But we are not as confident in the President&#39;s bill to allow market alternatives with respect to automotive air pollution, particularly ozone and smog. It violates fundamental principles of environmental protection.  Question: In what way?</p> <p>Mr. Hawkins: The so-called alternate fuels proposal would obligate vehicle makers starting in 1995 to sell 500,000 vehicles a year, going up to 1 million, that can use alternate fuels like methanol. The proposal would allow auto makers to market cleaner vehicles in one metropolitan area and dirtier vehicles in another. It would permit fuel refiners to market cleaner fuels in one metropolitan area, dirtier fuels in another.</p> <p>This approach is different from acid rain in that these reductions are not fungible. Why should New Yorkers be subjected to dirtier cars because auto makers found it convenient to sell cleaner cars in L.A.?  Mr. DiBona: There is a provision in the bill that permits fuel manufacturers and auto manufacturers to trade or share the responsibility of delivering these fixed numbers of autos or volumes of fuel, so I don&#39;t think that it runs into the problems you suggest. I agree that it would not make much sense to reduce the quality of air in Chicago to improve it in some other area. What we ought to insure is that the trades are commensurate.</p> <p>Now, we can debate a trade between areas. You can imagine that part of a given region might meet the ambient air standard and part of it might not. A trade between these two areas that reduced costs, brought the area not in compliance into compliance, raised the level of pollutants in the other, but not enough to put it over the standard, in some instances would be a sensible step.</p> <p>You&#39;ll get the most bang for your buck in environmental reduction if the next increment of pollution reduction comes from the emitter who can do it cheapest. And you will do that until his costs rise to the point where there&#39;s someone else who can now start doing it even more cheaply.  Q. Why is that better than just ordering pollution reductions?</p> <p>Mr. DiBona: The problem of the command and control system, in which the government sets pollution levels and everyone must comply, is that you set a set standard for everybody. Some people are going to be able to do better, but they don&#39;t have to. In fact, they have every incentive not to let you know they can do it better.</p> <p>Mr. Hawkins: The system often does lack the incentive to do better. However, our fix is different.</p> <p>The fix that&#39;s typically proposed is that you start with a base line. The government, with all its inability to spot developing pollution control trends, determines the amount of opportunity for further progress. A trading system is set up where people who have successfully withheld from the government information showing that they can do better will be able to turn that into allowances to pollute more elsewhere.  Q. In other words, this is a system that rewards those who have hidden their capabilities thus far?</p> <p>Mr. Hawkins: It certainly does. For example, in the Clean Air Act, there is a term - reasonably available control technology. A lot of proposals want to allow trading of pollution allowances if you do anything beyond what&#39;s reasonably available. Politically, how could you be opposed to giving credit for going beyond what&#39;s reasonable? Our remedy would be to impose a charge on emissions, to create an incentive for reductions.</p> <p>On the other hand, if you introduce trading of allowances into a system that is in the process of defining regulatory requirements, you have introduced a new incentive. You introduce an incentive to define the pre-existing regulatory requirements as leniently as possible. Because the more lenient the base line, the more opportunity there is for trade.  Q. Are we arguing over what level should be reached, or how to reach it?</p> <p>Mr. Hawkins: We are not arguing what levels should be reached. And, indeed, in Congress the petroleum industry is not arguing that the ambient air quality standard should be changed for smog. They are arguing about how many years these cities should be allowed to violate these health standards. It&#39;s not acceptable to have a 21-year period where these standards can be violated.</p> <p>Mr. DiBona: We are not arguing about the standards. We have argued that we and the government should spend a little more time getting information about alternative fuels. Companies might implement it faster once they have that information. They do not have the information on methanol because there have not been enough tests.</p> <p>The advantage of even using a lousy system of trading rights is that you don&#39;t have to set them for eternity. Then you watch how the system works. You&#39;ll get a lot of information on how to clean up that you would never get otherwise. And then you can re-set the system.  Q. We&#39;re still left with this issue of how to pick a starting point, of what is reasonably available control technology.</p> <p>Mr. DiBona: Let&#39;s say you use the current system of standards for pollution levels. And it was very bad because some people had succeeded in duping the authorities, and therefore had lots of trading rights. You will quickly learn whether or not they have the capability of going further at low cost because someone else will buy their rights. And you will discover those are the guys who can do it better, and you will learn about the technology they are using.</p> <p>Mr. Hawkins: If you try to change it at that point, as a regulator you will be accused of disrupting the market and eliminating the incentives.</p> <p>Mr. DiBona: You have to leave it in place, but not indefinitely. You have to say, this is something we&#39;re going to let run for 5 years, or 10 years to foster innovations. Because now I&#39;ve got something I can sell. Not only can I use it myself to reduce my costs, but I can provide it to others. And I think that there&#39;s some evidence that the current system doesn&#39;t provide much innovation.</p> <p>Mr. Hawkins: We&#39;re in favor of innovation. But the air pollution control area demonstrates just as many examples of scams, if not more, than of innovation.</p> <p>I&#39;ll give you an example I worked on personally. A steel company persuaded the state of Michigan that reasonable control for dust from its plant was to water the dirt road. That was the regulatory benchmark. Then the company went out and did something truly innovative - it paved the road. That&#39;s the innovation for which they claimed all sorts of credit so they could take off controls on a steel-making furnace.</p> <p>Everything that Charlie says about innovation using the regulatory benchmark approach is far truer about the approach that I am advocating, charging a fee for being permitted to pollute. If we want to try an incentive system, let&#39;s use what our economic system is based on: dollars.</p> <p>Mr. DiBona, couldn&#39;t your arguments be used to suggest a system where there was no benchmark, there was just a charge for pollution?</p> <p>Mr. DiBona: We have been advocates of fees in some areas. But fees can generate an immense revenue and that raises questions about whether you want the revenue effects or you want to use something like a marketable permit instead. Most fees are probably highly regressive and would tend to increase consumer costs in a particular industry. To the extent that the industry is in international competition, fees raise the cost of your goods relative to foreign produced goods.</p> <p>The marketable permit system permits you to specify the amount of reduction because you&#39;ve just issued that many permits to emit pollutants. Then let people trade them.</p> <p>Mr. Hawkins: There are hybrid systems being considered that would auction allowances. One of the issuesabout the marketable permits system - in fact it&#39;s being raised about the acid rain proposal now - is who receives these allowances, and whether there are barriers to entry created because the allowances are initially allocated free of cost to existing polluters.</p> <p>Mr. DiBona: You can structure them so it&#39;s not a problem. Auctions are a way of establishing value. But they&#39;re a problem because they may generate very large revenues.</p>
714222>Transportation Workers Face More Frequent Tests for Drugs Thousands of bus drivers, train engineers and other transportation workers in the region will face more frequent random testing for drugs and alcohol beginning in January under a Federal law that is expected to cost regional transit operators millions of dollars a year. The New York Transit Authority expects its annual cost of testing to rise to $5 million from $1.5 million.  <p>&quot;It&#39;s going to be a complicated proposition,&quot; said Jared Lebow, a Transit Authority spokesman, &quot;with some overtime or regularly scheduled extra train operators or bus operators, to make sure we don&#39;t impact service too greatly.&quot;</p> <p>The law requires that transit systems conduct one random urine test for drugs each year for every two employees in &quot;safety sensitive&quot; jobs, and one breath test for alcohol for every four &quot;safety sensitive&quot; employees.</p> <p>The degree to which alcohol is a problem is not clear. In August 1991 a drunken subway operator killed five people in a crash in Union Square, which prompted New York to increase its testing. In contrast, Connecticut Transit, a bus system with 775 employees, conducted 1,172 random tests over three years from 1991 to 1993 and found no alcohol use. It did find more than a dozen with traces of marijuana or cocaine, though.</p> <p>Some bus drivers in Connecticut and New Jersey have never been subject to random alcohol tests.</p> <p>At the Federal Transit Authority, Judy Z. Meade, the senior drug and alcohol program manager, said that some systems that had never tested would find &quot;in the neighborhood of 5 to 6 percent positive tests.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Rates will be fairly high for the first two years, because it takes time for corporate climate to change,&quot; Ms. Meade said. &quot;It takes time for John Doe to see his buddy Sam Smith be hauled away.&quot; But the deterrent will grow over time, she said.</p> <p>The Federal rules, issued by the Department of Transportation in February under the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing of 1991, requires testing in the middle of workers&#39; shifts, which means having substitute workers available. Most systems that test now do it at the beginning or end of the work day.</p> <p>Conducting even half as many tests as there are employees will not insure that everyone is tested. Michael A. Sanders, the Transit and Ridesharing Administrator at the Connecticut Department of Transportation, said that despite having conducted nearly 1,200 random tests in three years on a work force of 775, about 200 people have never been tested.</p> <p>While the Connecticut tests found no alcohol, Mr. Lebow said that at the New York Transit Authority in 1993, 0.47 percent tested positive for alcohol on random tests, and 1.85 percent in drug tests. The drug rate was comparable to Connecticut Transit&#39;s.</p> <p>The Transit Authority and other systems also conduct tests as part of pre-employment physicals, when workers return to duty after extended absences, after accidents, and whenever the authority is suspicious.</p> <p>At the Port Authority, about 1,400 employees who drive snowplows, dump trucks and runway sweepers will be subject to testing for the first time, said John M. Kampfe, a spokesman. Another 450 workers on the PATH system, including engineers, train dispatchers and signalmen are already tested for drugs, but not alcohol.</p> <p>At New Jersey Transit, existing drug tests nearly meet the new Federal standards, said Elizabeth Schneider, director of medical services. But alcohol tests will be new and will probably turn up a substantial number of people working under the influence, especially in rail operations, she said. &quot;People work unsupervised,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s a traditional railroad problem.&quot;</p> <p>Under the new Federal regulations, breath test readings showing a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.02 to 0.039 constitute grounds for taking an employee out of service for up to eight hours. From 0.04 up, the employee must be removed from the job and referred to a substance abuse program for professional evaluation, she said.</p> <p>In most states a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.1 (or two and a half times as high as 0.04) is sufficient to convict the driver of a private automobile of driving while impaired or drunk.</p>
470135>Ideas &amp; Trends; When a Nuclear Accident Doesn&#39;t Go by the Book WHEN it comes to nuclear reactors, nature seems to behave like a troubled teen-ager, the kind that goes through parking lots trying every door handle, looking for an unlocked car to take joy riding. Every once in a while, chance can&#39;t help but succeed, as it did 12 days ago with a sudden failure at the Nine Mile Point 2 reactor in Scriba, N.Y., which quickly became one of the most serious accidents since Three Mile Island in 1979. The plant, like all American reactors, has rugged components and a deep array of protective systems and back-up systems, a kind of industrial Maginot line. But with over 100 plants running, eventually anything that can fail probably will.  <p>The accident occurred as the industry is pushing for a new licensing system in which regulators would approve generic reactor designs instead of scrutinizing each proposed plant case by case. As part of the process, fewer public hearings would be held, and critics have already seized on the Nine Mile Point accident to argue against the new rules.</p> <p>The first question is exactly what happened, and investigators are still not sure. The accident began when a transformer, the kind found at all large power plants, failed a few minutes before 6 A.M. on Aug. 13, an event that was unusual but far from rare. In this case, however, the transformer sent a pulse of power into the plant and knocked out five of its eight central power sources. The industry used to call these uninterruptible power supplies, because each is served by power generated from three independent energy sources: the plant itself, the state power grid outside the plant gate, and if all else fails, a bank of batteries. But somehow the pulse knocked out all three sources to each of five supply points, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#39;s recent reports on the subject put the word &quot;uninterruptible&quot; in quotation marks.</p> <p>The three power sources that were not knocked out were feeding the most important, &quot;safety-related&quot; plant systems, and a crucial point for investigators is whether it was simply a matter of luck that those power sources survived.</p> <p>The plant manager, Martin J. McCormick Jr., said that operators had been drilled on how to deal with the failure of a power supply, but not on five failures at once. &quot;We didn&#39;t postulate that that&#39;s a realistic scenario,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Among the casualties of the power loss was the computer that keeps track of events around the plant, so a special investigating team that arrived from Washington shortly after the accident had to interview everyone on duty and examine the positions of valves and switches to piece together what happened.</p> <p>In a reconstructed chronology released last Thursday, the team identified one failure that seems positively perverse. Nine Mile Point has several computers; in addition to the one that tracks plant functions, another is meant for use in an accident, to show the operators at a glance the state of critical plant systems. It was put in by order of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission after Three Mile Island. Computer Blackout</p> <p>But in this accident, the computer was blacked out; it was not connected to one of the safety-related power supplies that survived the accident. &quot;It&#39;s stupid,&quot; said Steven C. Sholly, an engineer at M.H.B. Technical Associates, of San Jose, Calif., which specializes in reactors manufactured by General Electric, like the one at Nine Mile. &quot;It&#39;s supposed to tell you what&#39;s going on in an accident, but it&#39;s defined as nonsafety-related, and powered from a nonsafety-grade system.&quot;</p> <p>But maybe, he conceded, there is a logic of sorts. The system is supposed to tell the operator whether the reactor is in trouble, and if it is blacked out, then he will know the reactor is in trouble.</p> <p>Like most accidents, this one did no damage to the reactor itself. The power supplies that survived the accident allowed the plant to automatically shut down. Engineers from the regulatory commission are trying to determine what the implications are for other reactors. But if the problem is from a design flaw, with about 80 designs now in use, it will take time to figure out which other reactors are also vulnerable.</p> <p>In the future the process might be simpler if the industry wins approval for a new generation of reactors that would be built according to standardized designs. The N.R.C. has agreed to a system in which manufacturers would submit generic designs, which the commission would approve, just as the Federal Aviation Administration approves a type of jetliner, not each individual plane. Instead of holding multiple hearings for each reactor, hearings on a reactor design would be held once. There would also be hearings on the suitability of the sites that utilities submitted for approval.</p> <p>But critics ask what happens if the commission approves a design in 1995, a plant of that type suffers an accident in 2002, and a utility has an identical model under construction, complete with the newly revealed defect?</p> <p>&quot;The N.R.C. might order changes to all plants,&quot; said Michael Mariotte, a reactor specialist at the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, a watchdog group. &quot;But there would be no public hearing on the adequacy of those changes. And if the N.R.C. did not act, there would be no hearing on whether there should be changes.&quot;</p> <p>Industry critics will make that argument this fall when the United States Court of Appeals hears a challenge to the new rules. Similar rules are included in the Senate&#39;s main energy bill, which was approved earlier this year by the Energy Committee.</p> <p>But the United States Council for Energy Awareness, the industry&#39;s main lobbying group, sees no hazard. &quot;You have to give the industry some credit for acting correctly,&quot; said Marvin Fertel, a vice president of the group. If there is a problem, he said, &quot;nobody wants to fix it more than the industry.&quot;</p>
780641>New Waste-Dump Standard Is Recommended in Report Scientists assigned to tell the Environmental Protection Agency how to write safety standards for a Federal nuclear waste dump issued their report yesterday, and laid the groundwork for the agency to permit a level of pollution in the desert 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas that would make the area unsuitable for intense farming, even hundreds of thousands of years from now. But the conclusion about the Nevada site drew a sharp dissent from one of the report&#39;s authors and from environmentalists. The study, ordered by Congress, was released by the National Academy of Sciences.  <p>The report, in some analysts&#39; view, could open the way for licensing the proposed nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain, Nev.</p> <p>The authors make the assumption that a nuclear waste repository will eventually leak. The extremely arid land around Yucca Mountain is currently unsuitable for agriculture but could be farmed in the future if rainfall patterns change sharply. A nearby valley is being farmed with underground water.</p> <p>The report recommends a new standard for evaluating a proposed nuclear dump -- the level of risk posed to groups of people -- to replace the present one, the absolute amount of radiation that could be expected to leak hundreds of thousands of years hence. That conclusion was unanimous.</p> <p>But it also said that in defining a safety standard, the E.P.A.&#39;s rule-making procedure could make assumptions about how the land would be used, and whether subsistence farmers, who would be especially vulnerable to radioactive materials in the water they drank and used for their crops and livestock, would ever live there.</p> <p>The report said, &quot;Although not strictly a scientific issue, we believe that the appropriate objective is to protect the vast majority of members of the public while also insuring that the decision on the acceptability of a repository is not unduly influenced by the risks imposed on a very small number of individuals with unusual habits or sensitivities.&quot;</p> <p>But one of the 15 members of the panel, Thomas H. Pigford, a graduate professor at the University of California at Berkeley, and a founder of the nuclear engineering program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, dissented. By excluding the possibility that the area, now owned by the Government, will be farmed later, Dr. Pigford said: &quot;They end up with such a less stringent result that cannot be defended. That&#39;s bad for the project; it&#39;s bad for the country.&quot;</p> <p>The normal scientific procedure, he said, is to define the &quot;maximally exposed individual&quot; for any risk, and that in case of environmental threats like this one, that would be a farmer who grew all his food locally.</p> <p>In Nevada, Robert Loux, head of a state office created to fight the Yucca Mountain repository, said he was encouraged by the report because it called for the E.P.A. to go through a formal rule making, with public hearings and comments, to determine what rules should prevail. But Mr. Loux said it would be impossible to predict land uses.</p> <p>The report is part of a chain of events meant by Congress to result in opening a permanent geologic burial site for high-level nuclear wastes at Yucca Mountain at the edge of the Energy Department&#39;s nuclear weapons test site.</p> <p>The environmental agency is supposed to write standards for the repository &quot;based on and consistent with&quot; the report. The Energy Department is supposed to build the repository and apply for a license, based on the standards. And the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, an independent agency that supervises power plants and other places that use radioactive materials, is supposed to decide whether the application meets the environmental agency&#39;s rules.</p> <p>The E.P.A. is supposed to hold hearings and issue licensing rules within a year of yesterday, although people involved in the process predict it will take longer. In any case, the Energy Department is several years from being ready to apply for a license.</p> <p>At the Energy Department&#39;s Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, in Las Vegas, Dr. Daniel A. Dreyfus, the director, said the issue was whether the Yucca Mountain repository was intended to protect &quot;an average person in a target group,&quot; or &quot;some postulated community that has forgotten about drinking ground water, and doesn&#39;t know how to test for radionuclides.&quot;</p> <p>Dr. Dreyfus added, &quot;You can come up with all kinds of bizarre notions about the future.&quot;</p> <p>But a physicist and nuclear critic, Dr. Arjun Makhijani of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Resources, a private research group, said that the recent past should give caution. Dr. Makhijani pointed out that uranium had turned up in the well of a house near the Fernald Feed Materials Center, a weapons plant near Cincinnati, and that the Energy Department knew of the contamination for four years before it told the woman who lived in the house. She was among a group of neighbors who settled with the department for $78 million.</p> <p>&quot;To assume an institutional memory of thousands of years is perfectly outrageous,&quot; Dr. Makhijani said.</p> <p>The report is decidedly modest in describing the ability of science to settle questions that must be answered before a waste dump is opened. &quot;We have not recommended what levels of risk are acceptable,&quot; it says. &quot;We have not considered whether the development of a permanent repository should proceed at this time; nor have we made a judgment about the potential for the Yucca Mountain site to comply with the standard eventually adopted.&quot;</p> <p>Another author, Dr. R. Darryl Banks, a biophysicist at the World Resources Institute, an environmental group based in Washington, said that recent history is a guide to the value of predictions.</p> <p>&quot;One argument could be, 100 years ago,&quot; Dr. Banks said, &quot;one would not have theorized that you would have a major metropolitan area in that part of the region.&quot;</p> <p>Complicating the problem is the performance of the repository over future years; the report said the biggest exposures might not occur for hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
678302>Study Says Taxpayers Subsidize the Cost of Driving Private Cars Of every dollar spent in New York State on road and bridge maintenance, traffic patrols and related expenses, only 65 cents is paid by motorists, with the rest drawn from general tax revenues, according to a new analysis. The report, released yesterday by the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a coalition of environmental, planning and transportation groups, said that the difference, $2.4 billion, represents an unfair subsidy to drivers by general taxpayers, since 30 percent of New York State households do not own cars.  <p>Reducing the cost to drivers below the actual cost encourages more car ownership and the driving of more miles, the study said, adding to pollution, congestion and other problems.</p> <p>&quot;If motorists paid the full fiscal cost of driving, they would economize on some vehicle use that is not economical for society as a whole,&quot; said the report, which was prepared by Komanoff Energy Associates, a consulting firm in Manhattan.</p> <p>The report is part of an effort by the campaign to encourage investment in mass transit and slow the growth in motor vehicle use.</p> <p>It contradicts earlier research efforts, such as one by the American Automobile Association&#39;s New York chapter that found motorists pay $288 million a year more than is spent on them. But the A.A.A. study did not include local government expenditure, which the new report, which covers all levels of government, identifies as the level where the biggest subsidy occurs.</p> <p>The analysis did not cover areas outside New York State in any detail, but estimated that for the nation as a whole taxpayers subsidize motorists by $20 billion to $25 billion a year. Those numbers, if correct, would mean that the level of subsidy is higher in New York State than the national average.</p> <p>&quot;It has to do with the fact that New York has large expenditures and fewer drivers,&quot; said Cora Roelofs, a principal author of the study.</p> <p>Whether such a subsidy exists, and whether desirable, is a matter of dispute. Jerrold Nadler, a United States Representative from Manhattan, said the subsidy was large but hidden. As a legislator in Albany, he said, he introduced bills to require the state to issue budget figures to make the subsidy clear. But his legislation never got out of committee, he said.</p> <p>&quot;We have made it much cheaper for people to use automobiles than it should be,&quot; he said in a telephone interview. &quot;We artificially subsidize it, and we get more auto driving, more pollution of the atmosphere and more lung disease.&quot;</p> <p>He said it was possible that society might decide to make the subsidy, but first its extent should be made clear.  Instead, he said, lobbyists for drivers try to segregate money raised from fuel taxes to insure it is spent on roads, leaving the impression that the subsidy runs in the other direction.</p> <p>But Catherine Nolan, an Assembly member from Long Island City who is a leading advocate of more support for mass transit, said that spending money from sales taxes, income taxes and other general taxes on roads was appropriate, even if the taxes were paid by nondrivers.</p> <p>&quot;How do they get their milk?&quot; she asked. &quot;Do they go out to the farm by mass transit? How do they get their clothes?&quot;</p> <p>Maintaining roads and bridges, she said, was part of a &quot;larger good.&quot;</p> <p>But Ms. Roelofs said that the subsidy figure would be even larger if it included all costs, like property taxes foregone by local governments because so much land is dedicated to highways. It also did not include the costs of air and noise pollution, accidents and congestion. U.S. Charges Drivers</p> <p>The study found that not all parts of government subsidize drivers. Public authorities, like the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, deliver a surplus of $362 million that is spent on mass transit. The Federal Government also charges drivers nearly $50 million more than it gives them in New York, mostly through fuel taxes, the authors found.</p> <p>But local governments spend $2.151 billion more on drivers than they collect, according to the study, including $360 million by New York City and $1.791 billion from other local governments in New York State.</p> <p>The figures were mostly for 1991, although different jurisdictions use different budget years. User fees include taxes on fuels, parking, auto rentals and the petroleum industry in New York State, as well as license fees, tolls, parking meter revenues and other charges. Expenditures include road and bridge construction and maintenance, debt service on road-related bonds, the cost of operating toll booths and running licensing offices and traffic patrol.</p> <p>The Tri-State Transportation Campaign includes the Regional Plan Association, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
1361303>Screening of All Checked Airline Bags Is to Start Today, but Safety Concerns Remain As the airlines prepared to start baggage procedures to reduce the risk of bombing, experts predicted only modest improvements in security, and hoped for only modest schedule disruptions. Airline officials were nervously optimistic today that they could operate on Friday without major delays, as they began, under a deadline imposed by Congress, some form of baggage screening for every piece of checked luggage.  <p>Mostly they will check that on the first flight of each passenger&#39;s trip  no bag is loaded into a cargo hold without its owner being on board. They may also clear a bag by having a dog sniff it or by running it through a machine that detects explosives or by searching it by hand.</p> <p>Aviation experts say that the baggage rule and other steps taken since Sept. 11 have improved security but that holes remain.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;A good security system is a multilayered, interdependent system,&#39;&#39; said Billie H. Vincent, who was chief of security at the Federal Aviation Administration in the late 1980&#39;s. &#39;&#39;None of the layers are expected to be 100 percent effective, but taken in the aggregate, they have a better chance of 100 percent effectiveness.&#39;&#39; But Mr. Vincent said that even all of the measures now planned would fall short and some deadlines would probably be missed.</p> <p>In fact, some deadlines that are ostensibly being met on Friday will be missed in certain aspects. Bags, for example, will be matched only at the point of departure, leaving open the possibility that a terrorist could buy a ticket that required a change of planes, board the first leg and skip the second, letting the suitcase and bomb go without the terrorist.</p> <p>It does nothing to block suicide bombers, a point noted by many people who fly, including Secretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta.</p> <p>In another case of a deadline not quite met, a guidance document due on Friday from the aviation agency on how airlines should train pilots and flight attendants for coping with security threats will be delivered. But it is missing a crucial component, a report on the feasibility of carrying guns or nonlethal weapons.</p> <p>Congress set Friday, the 60th day after the new aviation security law was signed, as the deadline for some form of baggage screening, and the Transportation Department has responded by picking a course that is incomplete but probably achievable, and declaring it has complied. Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of an aviation subcommittee, said he would hold a hearing next week on whether the limited bag matching met the intent of the new law.</p> <p>Mr. Vincent estimated that 90 percent of the screening would consist of the partial bag matching. Dogs, he and others said, can detect tiny amounts of explosives, but they tire quickly or get bored and do not always tell their handlers when they have quit work. Hand searching is too slow to keep up with the flow of bags. The explosive detection machines can cost more than $1 million each, sometimes cannot be installed without rebuilding part of the airport and, because they are cumbersome to use, sometimes sit idle.</p> <p>Speaking about the requirement that bags be matched with passengers before the first takeoff of a trip, Carol B. Hallett, the chief executive of the Air Transport Association, said, &#39;&#39;We are hopeful there really will not be any change from what has been in existence over the last couple of months.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But in the next breath Ms. Hallett said, &#39;&#39;There have been days when it&#39;s been pretty horrific because of security breaches.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In the past, her organization had lobbied against bag matching, and airlines argued that it would cause delays at their hubs. The airlines appear to have won the argument, in the sense that matching bags will not be required on connections.</p> <p>American Airlines, the nation&#39;s largest, said it &#39;&#39;anticipates efficiently processing passengers through security and launching flights on time.&#39;&#39; American said it began 100 percent bag matching on Tuesday.</p> <p>The system&#39;s capacity to tolerate disruption has increased somewhat because the skies are less crowded. The Air Transport Association said today that the number of passengers boarding planes in December was 14.2 percent lower than in December 2000.</p> <p>Other security improvements are taking hold; the number of armed undercover air marshals in place is small, but growing, and all major airlines have installed doors that are harder to break down. The next step, already taken by some airlines, is doors that are impenetrable to bullets and bombs.</p> <p>Airlines now have 60 days to propose a training program to the Transportation Department. The details are secret, but Jane F. Garvey, the head of the aviation administration, said, &#39;&#39;This really shifts the strategy from a training program that has been much more passive to one that is much more active.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The plan does not tell the airlines whether to issue stun guns or other nonlethal weapons, or whether to train pilots to maneuver their airplanes to make hijackers fall over, but it does lay out what kinds of training crews would need if those strategies were adopted.</p> <p>--------------------</p> <p>Suit Challenges Screeners Rule</p> <p>LOS ANGELES, (AP) Jan. 17 -- The American Civil Liberties union filed a federal lawsuit today challenging the constitutionality of a provision in the new airport security law that requires all baggage screeners to be American citizens.</p> <p>The suit claims that the law discriminates against noncitizens, who represent more than half the screeners at some California airports.</p> <p>A NATION CHALLENGED: AIRPORT SECURITY</p>
398723>New Plan on Nuclear Licenses Is Barred In a blow to the nuclear power industry&#39;s hopes for a new generation of reactors, a Federal appeals court ruled yesterday that the Government could not give permission for operation before a plant is built. The industry wants such a system of preconstruction licensing to prevent problems like those at Shoreham and Seabrook, where reactors were built and then left idle for years because opponents argued that they were not safe to operate.  <p>In response, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission adopted a &quot;one-stop&quot; licensing procedure, shifting many regulatory decisions to the early stages of plant planning and construction.</p> <p>No one has applied under the new rules, adopted in 1989 after lengthy debate. In fact, no one has ordered a nuclear plant since 1978, and all the plants ordered after 1973 were canceled. Under the licensing rules used thus far, companies that wanted to build nuclear plants had to apply first for a construction permit, then build the plant and finally seek permission to run it.  Commission Is Disappointed</p> <p>But the new one-stop procedure was struck down by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit yesterday in a case brought by a nuclear safety group. The three-judge panel ruled unanimously that under the Atomic Energy Act, the commission must &quot;make a post-construction, pre-operation finding that a plant will operate in conformity with the act.&quot;</p> <p>The commission must also &quot;provide an opportunity for a hearing to consider significant new information that comes to light after initial licensing,&quot; the decision said.</p> <p>A spokesman for the commission, Joseph Fouchard, said that the commission was disappointed and that an appeal would be considered.</p> <p>At the United States Council for Energy Awareness, the nuclear industry&#39;s lobbying and public relations arm, Carl A. Goldstein, a spokesman, said proponents of nuclear energy would seek the change by legislation instead of administrative action.</p> <p>&quot;Our intent is to prevent frivolous intervention, which has been the bane of our existence,&quot; he said.</p> <p>At the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of investor-owned utilities, Loring E. Mills, vice president, said that while the industry always knew information that came to light in construction would have to be considered, the court&#39;s insistence on a hearing and a decision by the commission was a setback.</p> <p>&quot;There&#39;s no question we did not want to have to go through this hoop,&quot; he said. But under the decision, he added, the agency could establish criteria to screen out frivolous claims.</p> <p>At the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, a Washington group that initiated the court case, Michael Mariotte, the executive director, predicted that Congress would not change the law, and said the ruling &quot;helps protect the public&#39;s rights to participate in the reactor licensing process.&quot;</p> <p>In hearings at the Zimmer plant in Moscow, Ohio, after the complex was built, he pointed out, flaws were discovered that resulted in abandonment of the reactor. Hearings at the Comanche Peak reactors, in Somervell County, Tex., resulted in extensive new work.</p> <p>Another critic of nuclear power, Scott G. Denman of the Safe Energy Communication Council in Washington, noted that late hearings showed that at the Diablo Canyon plant, in Avila Beach, Calif., seismic supports were installed backwards or upside down. &quot;We are not supporting the idea of having frivolous hearings on issues that are not substantive,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re talking about critical safety issues.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Mariotte said that if there is a generation of &quot;advanced&quot; reactors, such hearings would be especially important.</p> <p>Executives of utilities and reactor manufacturers say that the cumbersome licensing system is one reason nuclear construction is dying out.  Choosing From Designs</p> <p>Under the Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#39;s one-step licensing procedure, utilities would be allowed to submit a list of potential sites and to select from among pre-approved plant designs.</p> <p>When the existing generation of plants was built, many issues were left until after construction was nearly finished. In the case of the reactor in Seabrook, N.H., opponents argued before construction began that the site was a poor choice because emergency evacuation of nearby beaches would be impractical. But the commission ruled that this issue could wait until construction was finished.</p> <p>Seabrook was eventually licensed and operated, but the reactor at Shoreham, L.I., was shut down under an agreement between the builder and New York State.</p>
478062>Technology; Using Compressed Air To Store Up Electricity Electric utilities confront a challenge unique in manufacturing: their product is consumed at the instant it is produced; customers can demand as much as they want whenever they want it, and running short of supply, even for a moment, is catastrophic. Thus, for as long as the industry has existed, engineers have been looking for ways to store electricity. They have used batteries, which are effective but expensive, and hydroelectric plants that run in both directions, which are less costly but damage the environment.  <p>On Friday, however, the Alabama Electric Cooperative dedicated a plant that uses a new system, one that experts say represents a relatively clean, efficient and cost-effective solution: compressed air.</p> <p>The $65 million plant, in McIntosh, Ala., 40 miles north of Mobile, draws electricity from a coal-fired power station 20 miles away at night, when demand for power is low. The McIntosh plant uses an electric motor and a compressor to pressurize an underground chamber of 19 million cubic feet -- 220 feet in diameter and 1,000 feet tall -- to 1,100 pounds per square inch. The pressure may sound high, but it is only about one-fifth of what the chamber could withstand.</p> <p>When the cooperative needs extra power, the air is withdrawn, releasing energy the way a balloon does. But it is not the air itself that provides the power to make electricity; the compressed air is fed into a turbine on the surface above the cavern. Turbines, essentially jet engines chained to the ground, burn natural gas or fuel oil mixed with the compressed air to spin a shaft, which then turns an electric generator to make power.</p> <p>Using compressed air in a turbine is not new; in fact, virtually all utility turbines use the technique. Usually, some of the turbine&#39;s mechanical power is diverted to compress the air. In this case, however, the compression is done the night before, by a different plant.</p> <p>The electric generator is the motor that is used to compress air. At night, it uses electricity to create a mechanical force, and in the daytime mechanical power is applied to generate electricity.</p> <p>As a result, the plant produces one kilowatt-hour -- or 1,000 watt-hours -- of electricity for each 870 watts consumed the previous night. In contrast, the most common mode of energy storage is pumped hydro, in which water is pumped uphill at night, and during the day a valve is turned and the water runs back down, with the pumps recapturing the mechanical energy and turning it into electricity. But in that system, each kilowatt-hour put in delivers no more than 700 or 750 watts back out again. Batteries have about the same ratio.</p> <p>Including the energy of the fuel burned in the turbine, the compressed-air system uses about 13,200 B.T.U.&#39;s to produce one kilowatt-hour of electricity. This would be below par for most power plants, but good for a storage plant. In a pumped-storage system, putting in the same amount of energy would produce about 12 percent less electricity.</p> <p>Hydroelectric plants often cost $1,000 per kilowatt of capacity, and batteries cost far more. The cost of building the Alabama plant was about $550 per kilowatt of capacity.</p> <p>The compressed-air concept is not completely new. A similar plant opened in Huntorf, Germany, in 1978 and has run well since then, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif., that contributed $8 million to build the Alabama plant. (The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association chipped in $660,000.)</p> <p>The American plant has one new twist, however: the exhaust gases from the turbine are used to preheat the compressed air after it is brought up from the cavern. That makes it 25 percent more efficient than its German predecessor, the institute says.</p> <p>Despite that innovation, there are no new inventions at the plant. &quot;We&#39;re integrating proven components,&quot; said Dr. Robert B. Schainker, an engineer at the institute. &quot;We&#39;re using very low-temperature machinery, standard kinds of machines. A dozen utilities are discussing similar plants, he said, and he would like to try a more advanced turbine operating at higher temperatures, which would be more efficient.</p> <p>Utilities know nearly nothing about building underground caverns, and Mr. Meyer said this was the element that most worried the co-op. But, he said, &quot;everything went pretty well according to plan.&quot;</p> <p>The technology of mining in salt, the geologic medium in Alabama, has been in wide use in the oil and gas business for decades. In fact, the method chosen -- solution mining, in which water is pumped in and brine is pumped out, leaving a void -- is the same one that was used by the Energy Department to create storage space for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The co-op&#39;s cavern begins 1,500 feet below the surface and stretches down to 2,500 feet.</p> <p>The plant&#39;s output is 110 megawatts at full capacity, which is fairly typical of power plants now coming on line. It can run for 26 hours from a fully charged cavern and supply the demands of 11,000 homes, the institute says. Typically, however, it would run 10 hours a day or less, when demand is high. Another advantage, Mr. Meyer said, is that it can increase and decrease its power level quickly.</p> <p>According to the institute, three-quarters of the United States has geologic formations &quot;potentially suitable&quot; for compressed air storage. A dozen utilities are discussing compressed-air storage plants, according to Dr. Schainker. Building caverns in solid rock would be more expensive, he said, but some areas have alternatives cheaper than salt, like abandoned mines or natural gas fields. The natural gas industry already uses depleted fields as storage grounds for its product.</p> <p>At the North American Electric Reliability Council, a nationwide utility consortium that co-ordinates planning and issues forecasts, Gene Gorzelnick, a spokesman, said compressed air storage was &quot;another technology that you can draw upon that allows you to use your existing facilities more effectively.&quot; A utility with insufficient power for peak hours might still have idle generating stations in off-hours; this puts idle plants to work and cuts the need for new plants.</p> <p>The cooperative has high hopes for its new plant, which entered commercial service on May 31, but was shut for modifications from early August until mid-September.</p> <p>According to Robert C. Meyer, the project manager at the cooperative, 85 percent of the company&#39;s customers are residential, and their demand varies sharply by time of day; as a result, a graph of customer demand has a peak every day and a valley every night, the peak about twice as high as the valley.</p> <p>That is mild, however, compared with the load profile of urban utilities, where the peak can be three times as high as the valley.</p> <p>With storage capacity, said Mr. Meyer, &quot;you have the opportunity to go out into the marketplace and shop around and get the best price for electricity, regardless of the fuel source.&quot;</p> <p>The institute says changes in the utility industry may make storage more important. More and more, electricity is generated by independent power producers rather than the utilities themselves, and these producers do not share the utility&#39;s obligation for uninterrupted service to customers. If the utility can buy the independent producers&#39; power when available and send it out when needed, it will not have to worry about these producers&#39; reliability.</p>
319149>Rebirth of Plant May Help Shoreham Contemplating a post-nuclear era, the purchasers of the idle Shoreham reactor on Long Island today toured a failed nuclear project here that is about to emerge as a huge gas-fired electric plant.  <p>The buyers, five officials of the Long Island Power Authority, are hoping to extract from Shoreham some value that could be used to pay for decontamination and cut the Island&#39;s rising electricity costs.</p> <p>Their hosts, executives of the utility that built the nuclear project here, are hoping to sell the skills they developed in their conversion, which will be completed next month, and to get a foothold in the lucrative market for electricity in the Northeast.</p> <p>The authority will be given Shoreham, on which the Long Island Lighting Company has spent more than $5.5 billion, as part of a settlement between New York State and Lilco. The settlement assures that Shoreham is not used as a nuclear plant but does not specify what it will be used for.</p> <p>Greater Capacity</p> <p>William T. McCormick Jr., the chairman of CMS Energy, the parent of the utility that tried to build the reactor here, estimated that Shoreham might be worth $500 million to $600 million as the foundation of a new electric plant.</p> <p>Converting it to gas would require $400 million to $800 million more, depending on the size of the plant desired, he said, and the plant might end up with a substantially greater capacity than the 800 megawatts that were expected from the nuclear Shoreham.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I promise you that we can do it better than anybody in the world, because we are the only ones who have done it,&#39;&#39; Mr. McCormick said, as the visitors, their shoes caked with mud from a walking tour of the site, clearly warmed to the idea of finding a use for a slightly radioactive white elephant.</p> <p>But a tour of the Midland Cogeneration Venture, previously the Midland nuclear plant, showed that &#39;&#39;conversion&#39;&#39; might be too strong a word. Because of major differences between a natural-gas-powered plant and a nuclear one, the plant itself is less valuable than the land, the connection to the power grid and the cooling water supply.</p> <p>Questions Remain</p> <p>The Midland Cogeneration Venture found a market for electricity for a broad area of the Midwest and for steam for an adjacent Dow Chemical plant. There is no market for the waste steam produced at Shoreham, which is in a largely residential area on the Island&#39;s North Shore about 110 miles from New York City.</p> <p>Major questions about Shoreham remain. One is whether it would be cheaper to start over in other locations. Another is whether the money for conversion might be better spent on increased efficiency by Long Island&#39;s electricity users, possibly saving more power than a converted Shoreham would generate.</p> <p>Other questions include who would own such a plant and who might buy its power. CMS would like to sell the electricity in Connecticut and New Jersey, among other places.</p> <p>Conversion to gas also presumes the completion of the Iroquois gas pipeline, which would run from the Ontario border to Long Island, linking New York with the gas fields of Alberta. The pipeline has not received final approval.</p> <p>For the Long Island Power Authority, a public agency made up mostly of long-time opponents of the reactor, another issue is whether the conversion poses a risk of technical complications and cost overruns.</p> <p>&#39;Risk Free for Us?&#39;</p> <p>On the flight here from Detroit on one of CMS&#39;s three jets, Richard Kessel, chairman of the authority, told Mr. McCormick: &#39;&#39;Shoreham has been a toothache on Long Island for 20 years. We don&#39;t want another 20-year toothache. The last thing I want to do is become another Lilco.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. McCormick replied: &#39;&#39;We can do it for you. If you contribute the non-nuclear asset, we will contribute all the cash, the equity and debt.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Risk free for us?&#39;&#39; asked Mr. Kessel.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Risk free for you,&#39;&#39; Mr. McCormick responded.</p> <p>Many companies that generate electric power say that even without the nuclear reactor to make steam, Shoreham&#39;s turbines, which convert steam to mechanical energy, and its generator, which converts mechanical energy to electricity, are still useful.</p> <p>But the turbine is designed for steam of much lower temperature and pressure than that produced by burning natural gas or coal.</p> <p>Giant Jet Engines</p> <p>The solution proposed by CMS is to install gas turbines, which are essentially giant versions of jet engines, that run on natural gas. The mechanical power made by the engines would be turned into electricity, and the 1,000-degree exhaust gas would be used to boil water into steam.</p> <p>Here in Midland, 110 miles north of Detroit, the steam from a row of 12 turbines is piped into the old turbine hall of the nuclear plant, where it spins a conventional turbine and makes yet more electricity.</p> <p>But another member of the Power Authority&#39;s board, Thomas Twomey, said that the old turbine would not be practical except in a large-capacity plant, and that it would never run as efficiently as one designed for the job from scratch.</p> <p>Among those seeking to convince the Power Authority that the conversion will work was Matthew C. Cordaro, a vice president of Long Lake Energy Corporation, of Melville, L.I., which owns several independent power plants. Mr. Cordaro said he knows the issue well, because in the 1970&#39;s, as a vice president of Lilco, &#39;&#39;I used to be responsible for all those studies that said you couldn&#39;t do anything else with Shoreham.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>One impediment to a conversion -and even to the Power Authority completing the purchase from Lilco - is the Federal Department of Energy, which is trying to block the abandonment of the reactor. But Mr. McCormick predicted that if a conversion were planned, &#39;&#39;I couldn&#39;t imagine the Department of Energy being so irresponsible as to hold it up.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>CMS is helping conduct a study of conversion under a $150,000 contract between the Power Authority and Reseach Management International of Sacramento, Calif. Mr. Cordaro&#39;s company is assisting in the study.</p> <p>Mr. McCormick said CMS could perform the decontamination of the Shoreham reactor for the authority. The current plan is for the New York Power Authority to supervise that work.</p>
722720>Technology; Battery Makers Are Betting on Lithium-Polymer Cells BATTERY makers are constantly looking for chemical reactions that employ inexpensive, lightweight materials which can be mass produced into a reliable product. The chemical process should run in both directions, so the battery can be charged and discharged repeatedly without the materials breaking down. And it should run at everyday temperatures. These requirements help explain why batteries are the weak spot in so many products, from cellular phones to electric cars.  <p>While no one knows which chemical processes will pan out, several companies and industrial consortiums are betting on lithium-polymer batteries. James A. Elsner, the president and chief executive of Hope Technologies, said his company is working on a &quot;credit card-sized battery&quot; that would run a palm-top computer; larger ones, layered or rolled, would run electric cars.</p> <p>Lithium-polymer batteries offer obvious advantages. Lithium is the lightest metal on the atomic chart. Lead, which is used in the familiar lead-acid battery, is one of the heaviest. And other components -- plastics and hydrocarbons -- are also light. The batteries are assembled in thin lithium-polymer sandwiches, sometimes less than a fiftieth of an inch thick.</p> <p>The goal is &quot;to run these things off the same way you make photographic film or magnetic tape, painting or spraying one layer on top of the other,&quot; said Russell Moy, a senior researcher at the Ford Motor Company. Mr. Moy represents Ford on the United States Advanced Battery Consortium, a Detroit-based group that includes the Big Three auto makers and is partially funded by the Federal Government.</p> <p>Edward O. Riddell, director of the transportation program at the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility consortium in Palo Alto, Calif., said: &quot;The problem with most of the new batteries we&#39;re playing with is they&#39;ve all got rare materials in them.&quot; Some work well, like the nickel metal-hydride batteries being used in some laptop computers. But Mr. Riddell said they could rise in price if they become more popular, because they are made from relatively scarce materials.</p> <p>Lithium-polymer batteries have another advantage. A solid polymer forms the electrolyte -- that is, the material through which charged particles migrate to create an electric current. It cannot leak, corrode parts or give off dangerous gases. The electrolyte in the familiar lead-acid battery has all of those problems.</p> <p>Lithium-polymer batteries already power small devices such as hearing aids. &quot;Assuming we can make larger ones work, and nobody has successfully done that yet, we have the potential of a low-cost, high-power, high-energy battery,&quot; said Mr. Riddell, who also sits on the United States Advanced Battery Consortium&#39;s management panel.</p> <p>Two independent teams are conducting lithium-polymer research for the consortium. Hydro-Quebec, 3M and the Argonne National Laboratory form the first team. Hydro-Quebec, the provincially owned utility, has been studying the technology for 15 years. 3M has extensive experience in manufacturing thin films -- from Scotch tape to more exotic substances. And Argonne, an Energy Department laboratory, will test the batteries. Last December, the battery consortium announced a $32.8 million research contract with the 3M team.</p> <p>The consortium signed a $27.4 million contract with the second team, made up of W.R. Grace and Johnson Controls. The former is a chemical company and the latter specializes in polymers.</p> <p>A third team -- A.C. Delco of Flint, Mich., and Valence Technology of San Jose, Calif. -- held negotiations with the consortium but broke off talks in late summer. Electric car advocates said the Delco-Valence team may believe it is on the verge of a major breakthrough. A.C. Delco, a division of General Motors, said that it could not conclude an agreement in a timely manner, so went ahead on its own. The two companies last month announced that they had struck a deal with the Eveready Battery Company to combine their technologies.</p> <p>ALL the teams are using a polymer sheet roughly the thickness of plastic food wrap, sandwiched between a lithium alloy anode, which attracts positively charged ions, and an oxide cathode, which attracts negatively charged ions.</p> <p>Hope Technologies, which will soon change its name to Lithion Technologies Corporation, plans to build a pilot-scale manufacturing plant to join the separate components.</p> <p>Hope, now in Willow Grove, Pa., plans to move next month to a new laboratory and corporate office in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. Its manufacturing plant there will be completed by the end of 1995. Valence Technology set up a manufacturing process but had trouble with its product. It has gone back to research and development, and hopes to have a product on the market by 1996, according to David M. Butze, vice president of marketing.</p> <p>The people who design battery-powered devices sometimes joke that in this life there are lies, damned lies and battery manufacturers&#39; promises. In fact, battery manufacturing start-ups are forever having skirmishes with financial regulators who say the promises are too rosy. Hope Technologies is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for decisions made by the previous management, Mr. Elsner said.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Elsner has a rosy forecast. He believes that Hope can build an 825-pound battery of about 6.4 cubic feet that would give a small car a range of 375 miles. The calculation assumes an energy efficiency of 200 watt-hours a mile, which is less electricity than is used by G.M.&#39;s two-seat Impact.</p> <p>Battery life, says the company, would be 110,000 miles.</p> <p>Others are skeptical. Dr. Mary Good, the Under Secretary of Commerce who heads the Clinton Administration&#39;s 80-mile-per-gallon super car project, said advanced batteries often turn out to be harder to mass produce than to create in the laboratory.</p> <p>But the electrochemistry is promising. In this country, the consortium&#39;s two largest research contracts are for lithium-polymer batteries. The long-term goal is a battery that generates 400 watt-hours a kilo (about eight times better than lead-acid batteries), and costs no more than $100 for each kilowatt-hour of electricity stored. The lead-acid batteries now found in gasoline-powered cars sell for $150 or $200 a kilowatt-hour of capacity.</p> <p>And another indication that this area may have the most potential, say American experts, is research elsewhere. The Japanese are pursuing the field aggressively, they say.</p>
1354165>A Promise on Baggage Screening Deadline John W. Magaw, President Bush&#39;s choice to head the new Transportation Security Administration, promised at a confirmation hearing today that his agency would not miss any deadlines for baggage screening and other aviation security measures. Mr. Magaw, nominated to be under secretary of transportation for security, declared before a Senate Commerce subcommittee: &#39;&#39;You will not hear me say &#39;can&#39;t.&#39; It&#39;s not in my vocabulary in this case.&#39;&#39;  <p>On Nov. 27, Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said a 60-day deadline in new aviation security legislation for screening all checked bags for bombs was unrealistic. The deadline is Jan. 18, and some airlines were seeking a 30-day delay.</p> <p>Separately today, a senior Transportation Department official went into greater detail about the department&#39;s efforts to improve airport security. He said the department would meet the Jan. 18 deadline, but also tried to play down its importance. The official said that because the law specified a &#39;&#39;menu of tools,&#39;&#39; the deadline could be reached.</p> <p>Screening of baggage can be accomplished by scanning bags with explosives detection machines, by hand searches, by using bomb-sniffing dogs or by matching bags to people to assure that no bag gets on a plane without its owner. Mr. Mineta said on Nov. 27, however, that the matching of bags, once considered to be foolproof, would be ineffective in deterring a suicide bomber.</p> <p>The law also requires all bags to be scanned by machine by the end of 2002. That will mean about 1,000 machines nationwide; about 160 are now in operation. In some cases, installing the machines will mean restructuring baggage systems and even buildings. Only two companies now make the machines and they produce only a handful each month.</p> <p>The senior transportation official said that the December 2002 goal was the primary one, and that the 60-day goal was simply a milestone on the way. &#39;&#39;Security is significantly better today than it was on Sept. 10,&#39;&#39; the official said. &#39;&#39;It will be significantly better as we move along month by month by month, and that&#39;s the real story here. That&#39;s what the 60-day requirement does, establish a baseline by which we measure ourselves.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Transportation Department said it had met four goals on Wednesday. A major one was issuing the qualification standards that airport screeners must meet when, beginning in mid-February, the department replaces the airlines as the party hiring the screening contractors, and, later in the year, hires the screeners directly.</p> <p>Screeners will have to have high school diplomas or the equivalent, or one year of &#39;&#39;any type of work experience that demonstrates the applicant&#39;s ability to perform the work of the position.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>They will have to pass security checks, and know enough English to read credentials and write incident reports and &#39;&#39;provide direction to and understand and answer questions from English-speaking individuals undergoing screening.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>They will also have to pass an aptitude test. But those already doing the work need not meet all the new requirements, at least until the government takes over the system.</p> <p>People laid off by airlines, airplane manufacturers or other aviation-related companies are to get preference for the jobs. The number to be hired keeps rising; once put at 28,000, it is now 31,000 and an unspecified number of cargo screeners.</p> <p>Additionally, the Transportation Department, through the Federal Aviation Administration, also removed most remaining restrictions on private planes that had been instituted after Sept. 11. The department had faced a deadline of Wednesday to drop the restrictions or explain why they were still in place.</p> <p>It also released a report on the state of security in general aviation and published a procedure for airports to seek reimbursement for some of their security costs. Congress has not appropriated any money for that purpose, however.</p> <p>At Mr. Magaw&#39;s confirmation hearing today, the only harsh questioning came from Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, concerning one of Mr. Magaw&#39;s former jobs, as head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</p> <p>Mr. Magaw was brought into that job to rebuild the bureau after it came under heavy criticism for its role in the shootout at Ruby Ridge, in Idaho, in 1992. The wife and son of a white separatist were killed.</p> <p>Mr. Specter said the bureau had shown &#39;&#39;egregious and reprehensible conduct&#39;&#39; in the case. He said the bureau had entrapped the separatist and provided bad information to the F.B.I. But Mr. Magaw testified in 1995 that the conduct of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms had been &#39;&#39;proper in every respect,&#39;&#39; Mr. Specter complained.</p> <p>Today Mr. Magaw said the bureau had made errors and as a result had changed procedures.</p> <p>A NATION CHALLENGED: TRANSPORTATION SECURITY</p>
391145>PRICE OF OIL JUMPS PAST $40 A BARREL Oil prices soared to record levels yesterday on renewed fears of war in the Middle East, closing for the first time above $40 a barrel.  <p>The price jumped after an announcement by the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, read over state radio, that he had a new missile with a range of hundreds of miles, making it capable of hitting Jerusalem. He told Israel, &#39;&#39;Blood will not enable you to retain the land of Palestine and Arab holy places.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Rick Donovan, an energy futures trader at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said, &#39;&#39;The tension meter went up another notch today.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Other financial markets snapped to attention at oil&#39;s command, as they have since the crisis began. Stocks fell sharply, with the Dow Jones industrial average off 78.22 points, or 3.1 percent, to 2,445.54. And in the credit markets, prices of Treasury securities plummeted and interest rates showed sharp increases. [Pages D1 and D16.]  Oil prices have now almost doubled since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, and motorists continue to feel the effects. The American Automobile Association said yesterday that gasoline at the pump was up an additional 2.4 cents a gallon last week, to $1.37, for a total increase of 29.5 cents. The price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline at a self-serve pump is now 1.8 cents shy of the record of $1.388, set on Easter weekend in 1981.</p> <p>Prices are being driven up, experts say, by commercial users scrambling to buy more in the expectation that oil may not be available later. And even at $40 a barrel, that belief is strong.</p> <p>Crude for delivery next month, the benchmark figure for most transactions, closed at $40.40, up $1.45 for the day and a record since trading in futures began on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 1983. It is now at approximately the level that spot trading reached in 1980, before inflation is taken into account. Oil would have to rise to about $65 to exceed the 1980 price adjusted for 10 years of inflation.</p> <p>Still in &#39;Tolerable&#39; Band</p> <p>For that reason, said Thomas A. Petrie, a stock analyst at Petrie Parkman &amp; Company in Denver, &#39;&#39;we&#39;re probably still within a band that is more tolerable than what first meets the eye.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Oil contributes a smaller share of total energy use in this country now than it did in 1980 and energy is a smaller share of the economy, but the impact is still formidable and price increases are hitting an already soft economy.</p> <p>But several traders suggested that prices would move higher in coming days. And after futures trading ended yesterday afternoon, oil for immediate delivery traded on the cash market 20 cents higher.</p> <p>Market experts say retail gasoline prices are likely to rise further because the spread between wholesale and retail prices is at least 6 cents smaller than usual. Unleaded gasoline for delivery in November closed at 98.26 cents a gallon on the Mercantile Exchange yesterday, up 4.51 cents, or $1.89 a barrel.</p> <p>Heating Oil Up 3.19 Cents</p> <p>Heating oil closed at $1.0615 cents a gallon, up 3.19 cents.</p> <p>But the focus yesterday was on the crude futures market. &#39;&#39;We broke the magic number, $40 a barrel,&#39;&#39; said Nauman Barakat, a trader at Shearson. He said of the Iraqi missile, &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true, but the very fact he can make statements along these lines goes to show that at this stage he&#39;s not willing to get out of Kuwait in a peaceful manner.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Daniel C. Yergin of Cambridge Energy Research Associates said the oil market was &#39;&#39;a thermometer for war fever.&#39;&#39; He described the $40 level as &#39;&#39;one of those round numbers, one of those things, like hanging, that tends to concentrate the mind.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Seeing prices rise and instability in the military situation is creating a &#39;&#39;precautionary demand,&#39;&#39; said Philip K. Verleger Jr., a commodities expert and visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. This could push prices up an additional $10 a barrel without war, he said, describing the run-up not as a matter of speculation, but as prudent action by traders. &#39;&#39;This is absolutely understandable, and is to be expected,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Product of Uncertainty</p> <p>Others think that the price is far higher than the balance of supply and demand justify, but say the increases are the product of uncertainty. &#39;&#39;People who are familiar with the Saudi oilfields say that it will be very difficult to inflict long-lasting or extensive damage,&#39;&#39; said Dr. George F. Friesen of the Deutsche Bank Group. &#39;&#39;Nonetheless, there is uncertainty about what will happen when bullets start to fly. And as long as there is uncertainty, prices will go higher.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But the price will exert new pressure on the Bush Administration to release more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, said Edward N. Krapels of Energy Security Analysis, a Washington consulting firm, and such a release could push prices down. &#39;&#39;At this point, our advice to traders is don&#39;t go long,&#39;&#39; he said, referring to buying contracts that incur an obligation to buy oil at a fixed price.</p>
608826>Traffic Deaths in New York Say a Lot About New Yorkers Around the nation one person is killed in an urban traffic accident for every 67 million miles driven. In New York City it is one death for every 29 million miles. Nationally the victim is six times more likely to be a driver or a passenger than to be a pedestrian. In New York pedestrians make up half the fatalities. Among them were three children killed in the last several weeks in accidents involving drivers whose licenses had been suspended many times.  <p>What is wrong with New York? The city&#39;s layout and density do not help, but one of the biggest problems may be that it is filled with New Yorkers.</p> <p>&quot;There&#39;s a lot of challenging going on out there, cars challenging pedestrians and pedestrians challenging cars,&quot; said Joel Friedman, head of the city transportation department&#39;s safety division. &quot;Unfortunately, the cars usually win.&quot;  In New York, Drivers Take Aim</p> <p>In other cities, Mr. Friedman said, pedestrians recognize the curb as a boundary line. Although drivers elsewhere may become angry if a person steps over the boundary, he said, they give way. &quot;Here, when you step off the curb, they start aiming at you,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Although traffic deaths have declined in the last few years, the recent accidents that killed the three children have raised troubling questions about whether more can be done to protect pedestrians. And they have focused attention on the way the police and courts handle cases involving bad drivers and on what many critics say is the city&#39;s laxityin dealing with traffic violations in general. No Fear of Red Lights</p> <p>In virtually every other city, for instance, running a red light is a criminal violation. In New York it is a civil violation, meaning that if the violator ignores the ticket, no arrest warrant will follow. (Jaywalking, however, is still a crime, carrying a fine of only $2 but the possibility, at least, of arrest for failing to answer the summons.)</p> <p>&quot;The city fathers seem to treat this as if it&#39;s some act of God, something they have no control over,&quot; said Charles Komanoff, a transportation analyst and frequent critic of city policy, of the death toll.</p> <p>The problem, he said, is that tickets for reckless driving in the five boroughs are rare. Unless otherwise posted, the speed limit on city streets is 30 miles per hour. It is a limit, Mr. Komanoff said, that drivers routinely ignore without much fear of tickets, in part because speed enforcement is mostly on highways.</p> <p>Mr. Komanoff cited studies showing that in car-pedestrian collisions, the chance of death rises very sharply as speed increases. Speed bumps, strict enforcement of speed laws and higher tolls and taxes that cut the use of cars would reduce the pedestrian fatality rate, he said. Increase in Enforcement</p> <p>But city officials do not like the idea of speed bumps, because hitting them at a high speed can cause a driver to lose control.</p> <p>As for enforcement, Mario A. Selvaggi, the Chief of Patrol in the New York City Police Department, said in an interview that his department had issued 1.53 million tickets in 1992, up from 1.46 million in 1991, and that the number would be higher this year.</p> <p>A year ago the department gave borough commands their own radar equipment for use on accident-prone boulevards, like the Grand Concourse in the Bronx and Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn. In the last nine months of 1992 they issued 6,500 speeding tickets, he said.</p> <p>On Friday, in response to recent accidents, the department began using special task forces on Queens Boulevard, Eastern Parkway and the Grand Concourse to stop speeders and people with broken headlights, bad tires or expired inspections. Two tours of 60 officers each will work on those arteries, he said. Many Citations Ignored</p> <p>Citywide the leading categories for tickets last year were failing to stop for a signal (300,000), driving without a license (289,000), speeding (100,000) and driving without a current inspection certificate (81,000).</p> <p>The problem, Chief Selvaggi said, was that the tickets weredecriminalized, in an effort to unclog the courts.</p> <p>Now that the violations are civil, he said, no warrants may be issued and one-quarter of the citations are ignored. He said the situation invited &quot;contempt for the law.&quot;</p> <p>Just last week the police created an exception to that rule; if they stop someone whose license has been suspended twice, they will arrest the driver. But only about a quarter of the police cars have the computer link-up to check on licenses.</p> <p>Traffic safety in New York tends to come to public attention when an unlicensed driver hits a child in a stroller. But statistics and safety officials paint a different, sometimes surprising picture.  Dangerous to be 80</p> <p>Nationally, most traffic deaths occur on the open highways, but in New York, where half the deaths are of pedestrians, the dangerous places are the &quot;signalized wide arterial streets,&quot; places like the Grand Concourse and Queens Boulevard, even though such routes comprise only a quarter of the city&#39;s street and highway network.</p> <p>Unlicensed drivers are indeed a problem; of the 574 fatal crashes in 1991, the last year for which a complete statistical breakdown has been completed, 95 involved drivers who could not present a license at the time of the accident, although some of those may have simply forgotten their wallets.</p> <p>But the victims are not the young; of the 296 pedestrians killed in 1991, the largest number, 55, were people in their 80&#39;s. There were 13 fatalities among children under 10.</p> <p>Overall, people 65 or older account for about 41 percent of the pedestrian deaths, although they are only 13 percent of the city&#39;s population, according to the city.</p> <p>Even so, traffic safety in New York is improving. Total deaths in 1992 fell to 570, versus 609 the year before and 691 in 1990.</p> <p>Although no one can completely explain the drop, which mirrors a national trend, city officials credit their grab bag of strategies. These include everything from a poster contest for elementary students and senior citizens stressing traffic safety, to shortening the interval between lane-marker stripes, giving drivers the subliminal illusion that they are going faster than they really are.  Contrasting Yardsticks</p> <p>Last year the Department of Transportation also changed the road signs on the Grand Concourse, removing some exit numbers, because numbered exits gave the feeling that the place was a highway, according to Joseph DePlasco, a spokesman.</p> <p>The death trend in New York zigs and zags but has been generally down since the early 1970&#39;s, when the toll for drivers, passengers and pedestrians neared 1,000. The peak year was 1929, when Model T Fords and other cars of that era killed 1,360 people.</p> <p>How New York stacks up nationally depends on the measure. The National Highway Transportation Safety Board calculates the traffic fatalities per 100,000 population, and that makes New York look good, at two thirds of Los Angeles&#39;s rate and one half of Houston&#39;s. But it ought to, considering most people use mass transit to getto work.</p> <p>A more sophisticated yardstick is the number of people who die per 100 million miles driven, the ratio that the Federal Government uses to measure safety. The national rate is 1.8 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles. The city calculates the national urban rate at 1.5, which is not surprising, and its own 1991 rate at 3.4.  Letting Friends Walk Drunk</p> <p>Among other big cities around the country, only Boston and Baltimore share with New York the casualty ratio of one pedestrian for each driver or car passenger.</p> <p>While pedestrians are obviously vulnerable, the problem is not always where one might expect. If alcohol or drugs were involved, chances are very good that the one under the influence was the pedestrian.</p> <p>This is not unique to New York; nationally in 1991, when there were 5,771 fatal pedestrian crashes, 32.7 percent of pedestrian victims were intoxicated, compared with 16.9 percent of the drivers, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In 7.8 percent of the cases, both were drunk.</p> <p>New York&#39;s statistics are similar. &quot;We have a significant drunk walking problem,&quot; Mr. Friedman said. Avoiding the Corners</p> <p>Chief Selvaggi said hardly anyone is arrested for public intoxication unless the person is creating a public nuisance.</p> <p>But Mr. Komanoff, the transportation analyst, said there may be less to the statistic than meets the eye.</p> <p>&quot;What they ought to be doing is analyzing position and behavior,&quot; Mr. Komanoff said of the pedestrian fatalities. &quot;If the pedestrian was lying in the middle of the Grand Concourse, that does exculpate the driver.&quot; But, he said, if someone has &quot;one drink too many and was teetering on the sidewalk, that doesn&#39;t.&quot;</p> <p>New York is accident-prone for other reasons, too. Mr. Friedman said that the streets were simply filled with too many distractions for pedestrians and drivers. There is also the pent-up frustration of a driver in crosstown gridlock who suddenly sees a few inches of daylight and takes off like a running back on the gridiron who suddenly spots a crack in the defensive line.</p> <p>And there are other problems.Nationally, pedestrians get killed while crossing the street or waiting at the curb. In New York about 3 percent of the fatalities were lying in the road before they were hit.</p> <p>Nationally, children are taught to cross streets at the corners. In New York, the &quot;Cross at the Green, Not In Between&quot; campaign familiar to generations of schoolchildren has been dropped because of drug dealers who congregate on the corners. Now the emphasis is on teaching children how to cross safely at midblock.</p>
364907>Disposal of Mild Radioactive Waste To be Less Restricted in New Policy Mildly radioactive waste could be disposed of in municipal dumps or ordinary incinerators or even recycled into consumer products, under a new policy that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, plans to announce tomorrow.  <p>Under current rules, most waste with detectable levels of radiation must be handled with special precautions and shipped to one of three licensed landfills in the country. The new policy would classify as &#39;&#39;below regulatory concern&#39;&#39; materials like gloves of laboratory workers, parts from decommissioned power plants and the carcasses of laboratory animals after experiments in which radioactive tracer elements were used.</p> <p>Environmental groups and some scientists say that adopting a uniform policy is unwise and could result in public exposure to radiation if waste is recycled into toys, jewelry and other common objects. The Environmental Protection Agency says the new policy is too lenient and plans to issue a rule in two years that could override portions of it, adding stricter criteria on the maximum permissible dose from material recycled or disposed of without controls.</p> <p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says that the new policy will allow Federal and state inspectors to concentrate on more highly radioactive materials, resulting in increased safety. The policy would also cover how much radiation could remain after a nuclear plant is retired, which will be a common activity in decades to come.</p> <p>More Time for &#39;Real Problems&#39;</p> <p>Kenneth M. Carr, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, has made the policy a high priority. &#39;&#39;If we are able to establish a list of things that we don&#39;t need to worry about as regulators, this would obviously give us more time to worry about - and deal with -real problems,&#39;&#39; he said in a speech this year to the American Nuclear Society, which includes industry and academic experts. If some activities carry a risk that is acceptably low, he said, it would be wasteful to add regulation to make it safer. &#39;&#39;Why pay for something one doesn&#39;t need?&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>But he added that the new policy was sure to face opposition. &#39;&#39;We already have one strike against us,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;The general public isn&#39;t comfortable with the notion of radioactivity.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But opponents say that the commission is taking the wrong approach. &#39;&#39;They&#39;re making decisions about how to deal with radioactive waste on an economic basis, and not on grounds on what would be best for public health and safety,&#39;&#39; said Jonathan Becker of Public Citizen, an environmental group founded by Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate.</p> <p>Much of the argument comes down to philosophy, in a field in which it is assumed that no exposure is so small that it is harmless. In an early draft of the new policy, the commission said that an activity that increases the risk of death by one in 100,000 would be &#39;&#39;of little concern to most members of society.&#39;&#39; But, Public Citizen pointed out, if this were extrapolated to the entire population of the United States, it would come to 2,500 deaths.</p> <p>Ambivalence in Nuclear Industry</p> <p>Public Citizen and other groups have also expressed fear that once waste generators are allowed to send some material to municipal landfills without controls, it will be impossible to know what they are sending.</p> <p>Experts say the policy could end the regulation of 30 percent of the waste volume, although it would contain under 1 percent of the radioactivity.</p> <p>The nuclear utility industry, which is an intended beneficiary of the proposed policy, is ambivalent. It already has the right, under a 1985 law regulating low level waste, to petition the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for permission to dispose of slightly radioactive material in unregulated or less-regulated ways, but no utility has done so, in part for fear of public criticism.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The proposal has a lot of technical merit,&#39;&#39; said Michael A. Mullen, a spokesman for the Duke Power Corporation, which operates seven nuclear reactors, &#39;&#39;but we also realize there are a lot of political and public relations considerations.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In addition, said Mr. Mullen, the policy might not save much money, because licensed burial sites have high fixed costs. If less waste was dumped there, the cost per cubic foot would rise, he said.</p> <p>Some Special Cases</p> <p>Duke, however, has successfully petitioned North Carolina and South Carolina to bury two categories of waste inside the fence at its reactors. One covers filters that have accumulated small amounts of radioactivity and pieces of lightly contaminated metal. The other is sewage sludge from the plant, which has trace amounts of radioactive elements not found in municipal sewage, he said.</p> <p>And in Texas, the Bureau of Radiation Control has allowed some radioactive materials that decay in a few months to go to sanitary landfills.</p> <p>The Conference of radiation Control Program Directors, a national organization of state and local officials, has conditionally endorsed the new policy, but has said that &#39;&#39;unnecessary exposures from frivolous uses of radioactive material can be prevented.&#39;&#39; Uses in consumer products, including food, drugs, cosmetics, jewelry and toys, are &#39;&#39;without justification,&#39;&#39; the conference said.</p> <p>E.P.A. More Cautious</p> <p>The new policy, according to people who follow the Nuclear Regulatory Commission closely, is likely to state that disposal or reuses are permissible if they do not give any individual an annual dose above 10 millirem. A millirem is a measure of radiation absorbed by tissue, taking into account the difference in damage produced by various kinds of radiation. The average American gets a dose of about 360 millirem a year, most of it from radon gas, and some from man-made sources like X-rays, bomb fallout and airline flights. One coast-to-coast round-trip flight results in about 5 millirem of exposure.</p> <p>The goal is that the sum of all exposures resulting from the new policy not exceed 100 millirem a year, but opponents say that if the activities are unregulated, this will be difficult to ascertain.</p> <p>But the Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a standard from any given source of 4 millirem per year, rather than 10. And the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, a panel of scientists that publishes radiation guides that are closely followed by radiologists, recommends that only activities producing a dose of 1 millirem be regarded as being too small to worry about. The chairman of the council, Dr. Warren Sinclair, said in an interview that adopting the new level as a blanket policy was unwise.</p>
370580>U.S. Imports Record 49.9% of Oil The United States imported a record 49.9 percent of its oil destined for its homes, autos and factories in the first half of this year, the American Petroleum Institute reported yesterday. The half-year statistics confirm a trend that has been evident in fits and starts for months: the decline of the  <p>The United States imported a record 49.9 percent of its oil destined for its homes, autos and factories in the first half of this year, the American Petroleum Institute reported yesterday. The half-year statistics confirm a trend that has been evident in fits and starts for months: the decline of the American oil industry.</p> <p>Demand for oil has been flat or even declining in recent months, because of a mild winter, but the balance is tipping to imports because domestic production is shrinking fast. It reached 7.63 million barrels a day for the first half, down 5.9 percent from a year earlier and the lowest in 29 years. By June, the last month of the first half, production was down to 7.07 million barrels a day, 7.3 percent below the level of a year earlier.</p> <p>While month-to-month figures jump up and down - June, for example, was the fourth month of the last 12 in which imports exceeded domestic production - it is clear that the United States, already the world&#39;s largest oil importer, is relying more and more on overseas supplies.</p> <p>U.S Is Still Second</p> <p>America&#39;s oil imports rose more than 7 percent in the first six months over the corresponding period last year, to 8.4 million barrels a day. This is about a sixth of all the oil in world commerce. The balance of American supply is domestically produced; the United States is still the world&#39;s second-largest producer, after the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The shift to imports means that the nation&#39;s trade balance is increasingly subject to changes in the price of oil, which can be sudden and dramatic. In addition, nearly all of the world&#39;s spare capacity to produce oil is in the Persian Gulf, and American imports from that region are now about a quarter of total demand, up from nearly nothing a decade ago.</p> <p>Demand for oil from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose major members include the Persian Gulf nations and Venezuela, rose by a million barrels a day in the first half, according to oil analysts.</p> <p>Some of the extra oil went into storage tanks, with prices low in recent weeks because of overproduction by OPEC. But the main reason for the increase is growing world demand, and stable or declining production outside OPEC.</p> <p>Edward H. Murphy, the director of finance, accounting and statistics at the institute, said the statistics indicated &#39;&#39;worrisome, even potentially ominous trends.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Another oil analyst, Peter C. Beutel of Merrill Lynch Futures, said imports accounted for 28 percent of the oil consumed in the United States in 1984. &#39;&#39;Whatever you say about Jimmy Carter, he had a home housing insulation credit for people who insulated their houses to save energy, a 55-mile-per-hour speed limit, and a semimandatory policy to keep the thermostat down,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>But another expert, George F. Friesen, an analyst at the Deutsche Bank Group, said the trend was not as clear as the figures made it look. Maintenance work at Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, he said, had temporarily depressed domestic production. He added: &#39;&#39;If oil prices start rising more rapidly as we approach the mid-1990&#39;s, I think you will get some improvement in domestic production. At least the decline in U.S. production will become less precipitous than it was in the 80&#39;s.&#39;&#39;</p>
1614533>Accusations On Detention Of Ex-Singer United Airlines and the Department of Homeland Security blamed each other Wednesday because a passenger, the singer formerly known as Cat Stevens, was allowed on a London-to-Washington flight on Tuesday even though his name is on a terrorism watch list. The government ordered the plane to be diverted to Bangor, Me., where the passenger, now known as Yusuf Islam, was detained.  <p>The plane, a Boeing 747, was carrying 248 other passengers and spent about four and a half hours on the ground at Bangor, where Mr. Islam, a British subject whom United States officials say has donated money to groups suspected of terrorism, was questioned. He was later brought to Washington and was scheduled to be put on a flight back to London. Mr. Islam was traveling with an adult daughter, who was allowed to stay in this country.</p> <p>Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, told reporters on Wednesday that the problem originated with an error by United Airlines in letting Mr. Islam board. Agence France-Presse quoted Mr. Ridge as saying, &#39;&#39;Unfortunately, United Airlines had the information and they didn&#39;t act on it before he got on the airplane.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A spokesman for Mr. Ridge, Brian Roehrkasse, who was present with when Mr. Ridge made the statement, confirmed that Mr. Ridge had said that the department had given the watch list to United and that &#39;&#39;United had the ability to act on the information but didn&#39;t.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But at United, Jeff Green, a spokesman, said in a telephone interview, &#39;&#39;That is not necessarily a very fair assessment on Secretary Ridge&#39;s part.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Green said that information provided by the Department of Homeland Security did not match that supplied by Mr. Islam. &#39;&#39;The system did not flag him as a no-fly passenger,&#39;&#39; Mr. Green said.</p> <p>He did not elaborate, but airline experts say the watch list contains more than just names and can include passport numbers and other personal information. The search for matches between passenger and watch list data is done by computer. Mr. Islam had last traveled to the United States in May; it was not clear when he was added to the list.</p>
347180>Earth Day at 20: How Green the Globe? - A special report:   Guarding Environment: A World of Challenges Twenty years after the first Earth Day, the Cuyahoga River no longer catches fire on its way through Cleveland, and bald eagles, once threatened by DDT, have increased nearly sevenfold in the continental United States, enough for Government biologists to consider promoting the population to &#39;&#39;threatened&#39;&#39; from &#39;&#39;endangered.  <p>Twenty years after the first Earth Day, the Cuyahoga River no longer catches fire on its way through Cleveland, and bald eagles, once threatened by DDT, have increased nearly sevenfold in the continental United States, enough for Government biologists to consider promoting the population to &#39;&#39;threatened&#39;&#39; from &#39;&#39;endangered.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Around the country there are scores of examples of modest environmental progress, which elected officials and industrial companies will hold up to public view today as thousands of people celebrate Earth Day 1990 and call on society to nurture nature. Everywhere, it seems, the thinking has changed; many corporations have dropped their old arguments pitting pollution against jobs and, sensing competitive advantage, are scrambling instead to demonstrate how &#39;&#39;green&#39;&#39; they are.</p> <p>But measuring progress is as hard as adding apples and oranges, elephants and ozone.</p> <p>From Streams to Stratosphere</p> <p>And the targets are shifting. Once concern was centered on narrow problems: the stream in the valley, the dump nearby, tiny snail darters or giant pandas. Increasingly, the issues are problems of the whole earth: industrial gases acting like glass in a greenhouse to trap heat around the earth, the destruction of the protective ozone layer. Scientists have discarded the image of Mother Nature with a black eye for one of Mother Nature stumbling toward a cliff.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The ozone hole is the smoking gun,&#39;&#39; said Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, who called the thinning of the protective ozone layer &#39;&#39;real proof that humans threaten life on earth.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>One sign of such change is that Earth Day, which began in 1970 as a nationwide event, has evolved at its 20th anniversary into a celebration across 140 countries, honoring Brazilian rain forests, protesting pollution in Eastern Europe and promoting behavior everywhere to preserve stratospheric ozone.</p> <p>In fact, the near-global agreement in Montreal in January 1989 to cut production of chlorofluorocarbons, which destroy ozone, is cited by many experts as the best example that as a species humans realize there is more to life than being at the top of the food chain.</p> <p>Around the nation, however, progress on the environment is mixed with frustration. Examples abound:</p> <p>*  Utilities in the United States are burning more than twice as much coal for electricity as they did in 1970, yet they are emitting 15 percent less sulfur dioxide, the coal byproduct that causes acid rain. The consensus, though, is that the reduction is not enough; 4,000 lakes in the United States and 164,000 in Canada are acidified or threatened, by the count of some environmental groups.</p> <p>*  The tailpipes of new cars emit 96 percent less carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and 76 percent less nitrogen oxides than older models. But there are so many more vehicles and so much congestion that half of Americans live in counties that violated Federal clean air standards in 1988.</p> <p>*  Fish have returned to the Cuyahoga River and to Lake Erie, into which it empties, and other Great Lakes. But the flesh of many Great Lakes fish carries toxic chemicals that make them dangerous to eat, and casts doubt on the wisdom of restocking the lakes.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;This is not the way to reconcile people with nature, and the public knows that,&#39;&#39; William K. Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said of the poisonous fish. Mr. Reilly, who carries a business card of brown recycled paper, is himself a symbol of the ascent of environmentalism, if not the environment. A former president of the World Wildlife Fund-United States, he is likely soon to be elevated to the Cabinet.</p> <p>Suddenly, Many Environmentalists</p> <p>Seventy-six percent of all Americans now call themselves environmentalists, according to a Gallup Poll. But many advocates who used to distinguish themselves by using the label say the environment is worse. And some say attempts to measure real progress are only clouded by the appearance of consensus that comes when everyone from Greenpeace members to chemical company executives marches under the same environmental banner.</p> <p>The agencies and protective measures that sprang to life after the first Earth Day -among them the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act - have pushed the country to reduce pollution. But global problems that were not even recognized 20 years ago, like thinning ozone and the greenhouse effect, have clearly worsened.</p> <p>Those pose challenges to society that are different from what came before. In contrast to the dwindling population of eagles, these problems may require solutions before the symptoms are plainly understood. Kenneth H. Keller, a chemical engineer who is a former president of the University of Minnesota, recently wrote: &#39;&#39;Our ability to affect our ecological niche is accompanied by an inability to assess the effects of doing so. In contrast to similar problems in the past, we are faced with the situation that the negative effects may be irreversible if we do not act to correct them, but that forces us to act before we can be sure that we understand them.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Warring Dioxides</p> <p>And environmental problems are often pitted against each other in a way that makes the whole problem larger than the sum of its parts. For example, acid rain is curbed with scrubbers that remove sulfur dioxide from power plant emissions. But the use of scrubbers requires more coal to be used for each unit of electricity; that raises carbon dioxide emissions, accelerating the buildup of gases that act like panes of glass in a greenhouse to trap the sun&#39;s warmth.</p> <p>Eliminating chlorofluorocarbons to save the ozone layer will make scores of industrial machines less efficient, raising their fuel use and therefore their output of carbon dioxide.</p> <p>The world is only coming to understand other environmental problems. For example, every year the Federal Government adds 35 to 50 plants, animals and insects to the list protected under the Endangered Species Act, and only 10 have been removed since the list was established in 1973. (Four recovered and six were determined to be extinct.) Species are being lost faster than they can be counted, but the Government list does not reflect that; the length of the list is only a factor of how fast the Fish and Wildlife Service can go through the legal process required to list the endangered species.</p> <p>Choices for the Third World</p> <p>While experts differ on the extent of progress by the United States, it is clearly ahead of Eastern Europe, where the collapse of the old political and economic order has revealed a history of almost unchecked destruction of natural resources.</p> <p>The most important choices being made in the coming decades may be in the developing countries, where population and economic activity are growing far faster than in industrial nations. If huge populations attain Western standards of consumption without some corresponding leap in efficiency, nature will reel.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We need to alter the presumption that increased consumption and economic growth are essential to prosperity,&#39;&#39; said Peter Dykstra, head of the Washington office of Greenpeace.</p> <p>CHANGING VIEWS</p> <p>Many Shades, All of Them Green</p> <p>If the physical world is ambiguous, the political world is not, especially since the Exxon Valdez impaled itself on Bligh Reef in March 1989 and the Chernobyl reactor spewed radiation across the Ukraine and much of Europe three years earlier. Concern for nature has claimed hearts and minds around the world. As Yogi Berra might have said, suddenly the environment is all around us.</p> <p>For example, a New York Times/CBS News Poll asked a random sample of Americans if they agreed that &#39;&#39;protecting the environment is so important that requirements and standards cannot be too high, and continuing environmental improvements must be made regardless of cost.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The question was framed in those provocative terms to identify people who felt strongly about the environment. When it was first asked, in September 1981, 45 percent said yes. This month, 74 percent did. Mr. Reilly, the E.P.A. Administrator, who was widely respected as an environmentalist before President Bush appointed him, said that if he had been asked the question by a poll taker, he would have answered no, that some steps would be too extreme even for him. And some suspect that the current fever of interest is an unsustainable fad.</p> <p>In the Mainstream</p> <p>But to be an environmentalist is to be in the mainstream, as demonstrated in a recent speech by none other than Edgar S. Woolard, the chairman of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, which once advertised &#39;&#39;Better Living Through Chemistry.&#39;&#39; Now he argues that survival belongs to the environmentally fit.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Industrial companies will ignore the environment only at their peril,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Corporations that think they can drag their heels indefinitely on genuine environmental problems should be advised: Society won&#39;t tolerate it, and Du Pont and other companies with real sensitivity and environmental commitment will be there to supply your customers after you&#39;re gone.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The idea that the public will reward companies that strike a protective pose toward nature seems demonstrated by the experience of Conoco, a Du Pont subsidiary that is the world&#39;s 20th-largest oil company, which recently announced that it was changing the recipe of its gasoline to reduce air pollution. From coast to coast, Conoco said, it received telephone calls from individuals and organizations asking where its gasoline could be bought. Public opposition to fishing methods that trapped dolphins in tuna nets led the biggest tuna canning companies to agree to buy only from fishing boats that use other methods.</p> <p>Other industrialists have said the public&#39;s changing attitude has changed too much. One casualty between this Earth Day and the first one, some companies say, is the credibility of the Federal Government; the model of future environmental regulation, they say, may be Alar, an herbicide that was effectively banned not by the Government, which said there was not enough information to justify the step, but by a report from a nonprofit environmental group widely reported on television and in newspapers.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Frequently stories of doom and gloom are reported without any scientific counterpoint or peer review,&#39;&#39; complained William D. Fay, administrator of the Clean Air Working Group, an industry lobbying group.</p> <p>Another industry spokesman, Richard M. Morrow, the chairman of Amoco, said environmental politics and bad or incomplete science were leading to poor choices in allocating scarce resources. Speaking of the national effort to clean up thousands of toxic waste sites, he said: &#39;&#39;The Federal Superfund program will spend huge amounts of money and tie up some of the country&#39;s top technical people to deal with waste sites that in many cases pose no particular threat to anyone. Yet the country is strapped for funds to deal with such issues as drugs, education and public health.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>An &#39;Environmental Ethic&#39;</p> <p>The reasons for the shift toward environmentalism are not clear even to those who have fought for it. Some trace it to a merger of two popular concerns: preservation of the wild and fear of cancer. A recurrent theme of environmental decay is the presence of new chemicals, often man-made, that are suspected or confirmed carcinogens.</p> <p>The global nature of problems like diminishing stratospheric ozone, deforestation and hunger has had its own effect on attitudes, blurring the boundaries between nations, some experts say. The environmentalists&#39; response to the Chernobyl disaster - that a nuclear accident anywhere is an accident everywhere - has parallels that apply to pollution. Political change has also brought nations together; countries in the European Community are now moving as a single unit to impose tailpipe emission standards.</p> <p>Advocates in the field say they are surprised by the high level of public knowledge around the world about the ozone hole, especially given the confusing nature of ozone. The helpful molecule being destroyed in the stratosphere is the same one that is created by automotive pollution at ground level, where it causes irritation and lung damage.</p> <p>All this consciousness adds up to an important change for the environment, experts say, perhaps more than any invention, regulation or other development has wrought in the last two decades. What remains to be seen is how long the attitude, which also seemed dominant on previous Earth Days, will endure. But for now longtime environmental advocates are basking.</p> <p>James Gustave Speth, president of the World Resources Institute in Washington, said the biggest development since the first Earth Day was &#39;&#39;the steady and sometimes spectacular growth of worldwide public concern about environmental degradation, and of citizen action and organization to meet these challenges.&#39;&#39; John C. Sawhill, president of the Nature Conservancy, called it &#39;&#39;the gradual &#39;mainstreaming&#39; of environmental activism.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Dykstra of Greenpeace&#39;s Washington office said that in January 1988 his office received 1,000 requests for general information; by February 1990 that figure was 1,000 a day.</p> <p>Michael Deland, chairman of the President&#39;s Council on Environmental Quality, said an &#39;&#39;environmental ethic&#39;&#39; had emerged nationally and internationally since the first Earth Day.</p> <p>Where this ethic is leading is less clear. The collective push of the individual choices of Americans often points away from environmentally sound practice. For example, the average gas mileage of new cars declined 4 percent from the model year 1988 to 1990 after rising about 50 percent in the previous decade. Buyers are voting with their feet -specifically, the foot on the gas pedal. Americans still prefer heavier cars with bigger engines and better acceleration, the auto makers say. And the number of miles they drive rises about 2 percent a year, year in and year out.</p> <p>And garbage, that index of prosperity, is still rising. Discards per person per day, 2.5 pounds in 1960, reached 3.6 pounds by 1986, the most recent year for which the E.P.A. has released figures. Discards are increasing faster than recycling or burning to recover energy.</p> <p>Nearly every human activity affects the environment. The two pages to print this article in 1.7 million copies of The New York Times required nearly 20 tons of paper, which began as 400 evergreen trees, mostly spruce, that covered about two acres.</p> <p>While individuals may not always make the choices that help nature most, sometimes regulation forces steps that bring measurable progress. For example, tests showed that concentrations of the pesticide DDT in human tissue fell from an average of 8 parts per million in 1970 to 2 in 1983 as a result of a Federal ban. (Concentrations fell in bald eagles, too, leading to their partial recovery.) Lead concentrations in blood fell 40 percent from 1975 to 1981, and the number of people with more than 1 part per million of cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls declined from about 70 percent of the population in 1972 to about 10 percent in 1983.</p> <p>The gains are by no means uniform. For example, atmospheric concentrations of two of the most ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons, CFC-11 and CFC-12, increased by 85 percent from 1975 to 1985. The Montreal protocol, which took effect in July, will gradually reduce production of the chemicals.</p> <p>In the absence of a comprehensive yardstick of environmental progress, perhaps the closest thing is a broad measure of human health: life expectancy. It is now 75 years, up from 70.9 years in 1970, according to the Census Bureau.</p> <p>STAYING INVENTIVE</p> <p>Living Cleaner, Living Smarter</p> <p>All these signs of environmental progress and even degradation are actually a result of overall human progress, said Julian Simon, a professor at the University of Maryland business school who espouses the unconventional view that a bigger population is a plus because it means more human creativity and more progress.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The list of things we can worry about is reasonably short,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We can worry about getting fed, the safety of our children, having a car, things like that. Now we don&#39;t worry about our children dying of smallpox; as we successively solve one problem after another, we work our way down the list, and we&#39;ve worked our way down to the environment.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>For the United States, said Dr. Simon, this began in the 1950&#39;s and 60&#39;s with rising prosperity. In the third world, &#39;&#39;the super-poor can&#39;t pollute at all because they don&#39;t have anything to pollute with.&#39;&#39; But with economic progress, he said, &#39;&#39;they will get affluent enough that they want to buy cleanliness.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Dr. Simon&#39;s underlying thesis is that standards of living, the availability of raw materials and life expectancies are all rising because the world is progressively inventing its way out of problems, expanding the pie of materials, goods and services faster than it is adding people to divide the pie.</p> <p>Toward a Solar Future?</p> <p>The thesis that progress brings environmentalism may be tested soon in Eastern Europe, where the collapse of Communism has exposed environmental exploitation and an aspiration not only for political freedom, but also for clean air and healthy forests, and an end to what Mr. Dykstra of Greenpeace calls &#39;&#39;environmental repression.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Even less sanguine experts agree that the process of inventing the way out of problems is continuing on some level. With some encouragement from the Government, scientists and engineers are laying the technological foundations for what experts say will be an economy that does not consume scarce resources or continuously add pollution.</p> <p>The most promising invention of the last 20 years, says Dr. Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund, is the photovoltaic cell, which turns sunlight into electricity. The price of such cells is still too high to compete with electricity produced from oil but is falling rapidly; the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility research consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif., says some utilities may find solar cells cheaper than oil for some power needs by the middle of this decade.</p> <p>With continued progress, many hope that solar cells, with cheap energy storage systems, will supplant oil, coal and natural gas.</p> <p>That is in the future. A host of smaller technological advances in the last decade have enabled Americans to use energy more efficiently. And some experts say this could point the way for other countries.</p> <p>Increasing Efficiency</p> <p>At the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, Marc Ledbetter, a spokesman, pointed out that in the last 20 years, the American economy had grown by roughly half while energy use rose only about 10 percent. &#39;&#39;Had this improvement not occurred, we would now be spending an additional $150 billion per year on energy, emitting billions of more tons of carbon dioxide and other air and water pollutants,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The increase in efficiency comes from improvements in products that consumers are using. Technology holds out the prospect of continued improvements, of course, but partly because it has advanced much faster than the marketplace.</p> <p>For example, the average electric water heater in use in 1985 consumed 4,000 kilowatt-hours a year, according to the council, while the average new model bought that year required 3,500. But for years water heaters have been available that used only 1,500 kilowatt-hours a year, and the best expected to be available in the 1990&#39;s do the same work for just over 1,000 kilowatt-hours. An economist might find it cost-effective to rip out an old model and replace it with a new one, but few people bother. Even when an old appliance must be replaced because it has broken down, buyers sometimes balk at the higher purchase price of a more efficient model. And the pollution that comes from extra energy consumption is often not calculated in the price.</p> <p>The difference between the typical 1985 heater and the best 1990&#39;s heater, a difference of 3,000 kilowatt-hours a year, is equivalent to about 1.25 tons of coal. Each household that makes such a switch will save an attendant amount of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide from being released into the atmosphere through coal burning.</p> <p>The challenge for households and policy makers is how to push the American economy toward the 1,000-kilowatt-hour model. The trend toward greater energy efficiency stalled last year, and while it began improving again in late 1989, its future course is not certain.</p> <p>Abstinence Isn&#39;t Virtue</p> <p>The progress is important because the United States, with about 2 percent of the world&#39;s population, uses 24 percent of its energy, about twice as much as Western Europe and Japan per unit of economic output. In contrast, China, with about 20 percent of the world&#39;s population, uses 9 percent of its energy.</p> <p>For China, as for all the third world, this is a result not of virtue or voluntary abstinence but of poverty. If China were to achieve the same rate of energy consumption as the United States, that would nearly double world consumption. Much of the increase would probably come from burning more coal, vastly increasing the output of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide.</p> <p>One solution is to encourage the third world to use energy more efficiently that the United States does: in other words, when China puts a water heater in every house to make sure its leaders chose the most efficient one available.</p> <p>But the developing world seems least likely to make such choices. It seems to be polluting more and enjoying it less. A recent study by the Department of Energy found that in the United States, about 8 percent of the electricity generated is lost in transmission before it reaches the consumer. For Pakistan, the figure is 28 percent. It takes China 37 percent more energy to make a ton of paper than it takes the United States, the study reported.</p> <p>Some experts say that moving to very efficient practices would help the environment and also help the poor. This stands in contrast to the idea common in past decades that sound environmental practice was in conflict with economic development.</p> <p>&#39;We Have to Take the Lead&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;ve been the world&#39;s banker and the world&#39;s policeman before,&#39;&#39; said Tom Hayden, a California Assemblyman who has long been an environmentalist. &#39;&#39;Now instead of operating the most wasteful economy in the world, we have to take the lead in showing how environmental protection, human health and economic efficiency go together.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Some scientists say innovation can eliminate the main source of pollution in a generation. Dr. Oppenheimer, of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the United States could end its use of fossil fuels by Earth Day 2030 if Americans switched to 100 mile-per-gallon cars and mass transit, moved closer to work, used lightbulbs drawing 75 percent less current, modernized industry to grow while using less power and moved aggressively to develop renewable energy sources.</p> <p>Mr. Deland of the White House said, &#39;&#39;A sound and safe environment and a flourishing economy are two sides of the same coin.&#39;&#39; He said environmental improvement would require changes in the way people live their lives, but he added, &#39;&#39;As more and more people realize that changes in lifestyle do not result in less enjoyment or less leisure, but in cleaner air and water and better health, we will realize remarkable progress over the next 20 years.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>ENDURING GROWTH</p> <p>More Mouths, Less Land</p> <p>Many experts say technological invention and economic progress will reach its limits in the face of rising population, which is now 5.3 billion and will probably be 1 billion higher by the turn of the century.</p> <p>That population appears to be putting more and more pressure on the planet. In the first chapter of the Bible, God gives Adam and Eve &#39;&#39;every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,&#39;&#39; and Dr. Peter M. Vitousek, a Stanford biologist, said humans had taken a huge chunk of the gift. Of the total amount of energy captured by green plants worldwide, he calculated, nearly 40 percent is controlled or consumed by humans. The figure includes trees cut for lumber or paper, and grain harvested as animal feed.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;That&#39;s an enormous fraction for one species to have control of,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It says that as the population continues to increase, we can&#39;t keep using things in a business-as-usual way.&#39;&#39; Dr. Vitousek&#39;s calculation also implies less and less for the other species.</p> <p>A growing population could be accommodated by developing plants that put more of their product into food and less into roots and leaves, he said. But right now, he went on, farmers are pumping well water for irrigation faster than it can be replenished, poisoning water with fertilizer and carrying out other steps that cannot be sustained for long. &#39;&#39;Our present mix of technology and population is too high,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Grains, People and Topsoil</p> <p>Some damaging practices are already taking their toll. Researchers at the Worldwatch Institute say world grain output, while racing ahead, is no longer racing as fast as population is. The reasons are erosion, over-irrigation and other practices that ruin farmland. The loss of protective ozone allows the entry of radiation that stunts plants as well as hurting animals. According to Worldwatch, grain output per person rose 26 percent in the 70&#39;s, but fell 2 percent in the 80&#39;s and will fall 7 percent more in the 90&#39;s.</p> <p>Cropland is literally disappearing, running down the rivers and blowing away with the wind, so much so that atmospheric scientists in Hawaii can tell when the spring plowing begins in China. Yet with 24 billion fewer tons of topsoil each year, the world&#39;s farmers now try to feed 86 million more people each year. That is about the amount of topsoil in Australia&#39;s wheatland. &#39;&#39;Those two trends cannot both continue,&#39;&#39; Lester R. Brown of Worldwatch said.</p> <p>The area under cultivation has fallen 7 percent since 1981 after rising 24 percent in the preceding three decades. The decline results partly from public policy in the United States, where farmers are paid not to grow, and partly from conversion of cropland to nonagricultural uses like housing and industry. But more of it is from erosion.</p> <p>The Soviet Union has abandoned 13 percent of the land on which it formerly grew grain. By 1980, India listed more than one-third of its land area as degraded, by wind, water, salt or other problems. The desert is advancing across Africa, and Latin America shows severe signs of stress. Crop yields in Africa are down 27 percent per person from their peak, and in Latin America 13 percent.</p> <p>The Press for Greater Output</p> <p>Food and development pressures do not stop at the shore. Despite numerous treaties, environmentalists say that the world still needs an effective international agreement to stop overfishing and that the lack of one has degraded oceans.</p> <p>The world can compensate for loss of cropland if the remaining land is more productive. Mr. Brown sees limits, however. In parts of Tamil Nadu state in India, the water table fell almost 100 feet during the 1970&#39;s; the increased agricultural production that irrigation allowed seems unlikely to be sustained.</p> <p>And the most productive places are in the middle and northern latitudes, where the greenhouse effect is postulated to be the strongest. And drought, like the one that hit the American plains in 1988, can result from greater heat as well as from lower rainfall.</p> <p>The solution may lie in finding new ways to put food on the table, or in strategies to have to set fewer plates.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The best technologies in the world,&#39;&#39; said Michael Fischer, executive director of the Sierra Club, &#39;&#39;will not save us if there are too many mouths to feed.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>INVENTING CLEAN AIR: THE PACE OF PROGRESS</p> <p>Catalytic Converter</p> <p>In widespread use for a decade, the device has greatly reduced two types of pollutants emitted by tailpipes. It burns hydrocarbon molecules that did not fully combust as they passed through gasoline engines. It also splits apart nitrogen oxide that formed in gasoline combustion. A catalytic converter adds more than $400 to the cost of a car and cuts carbon monoxide emissions 76 percent and nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbon emissions 96 percent.</p> <p>Indutrial Scrubber</p> <p>Coal is cheap and abundant, but may include 3.5 sulfur. when burned, this makes sulfur dioxide, a major ingredient of acid rain. Scrubbers run smoke through lime or limestone, usually mixed with water, to bind it chemically. After two decades of improvements, the scrubbers can remove 95 percent of sulfur dioxide, but produce hundreds of thousands ot tons of waste a year at each plant. Scrubbers consume 5 percent of the energy produced by burning the coal, thereby raising total coal consumption.</p> <p>Photovoltaic Cell</p> <p>Photovoltaic cells make electricity directly from sunlight. Energy in the form of light hits the silicon of the cell and shakes loose an electron, which creates electric current. Scientists are pregressively raising the amount of energy that the cells capture, and lowering their costs; the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility consortium, says that later this decade solar cells will become cheaper than conventional power sources in the sunny Southwes</p> <p>AN ENVIRONMENTAL PARABLE</p> <p>Americans have lamps. Americans heat their water with electricity. Americans have refrigerators. These things are rare in countries like China. One American now uses as much electricity as 200 people in China.  China&#39;s leaders want their people to have refrigerators. They hope to distribute billions of light bulbs. There are big plans for hot-water heaters.</p> <p>Progress brings choices. Life in China is improving so quickly for so many that the choices China makes will make a big difference around the world. And there are more countries like China: with big or fast-growing populations, and with enough resources to make big leaps in the amount of electricity used.</p> <p>The more electricity used, the more coal burned. The more coal burned, the more pollution in the air. The more pollution, the more gasses in the air to trap heat.</p> <p>Some light bulbs (and water heaters) use a lot of electricity. Some do not. Good bulbs needs a fifth the electricity of bad bulbs. Good heaters need a quarter the electricity of bad heaters.</p> <p>A China with living standards raised to America&#39;s could avoid spewing more than 20 billion tons a year of carbon pollution into the air if it choses efficient appliances instead of inefficient appliances.</p> <p>Would that make a difference? That amount of pollution is more than triple the total carbon pollution now sent into the air each year by industry and other fuel users around the world.</p>
660964>Ultraviolet Faces Revival To Fight TB With drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis spreading in big cities around the country, researchers in New York will begin a six-city test later this year with a 50-year-old technology for killing the bacteria mechanically: ultraviolet lamps. Using money from electric utilities, including the Consolidated Edison Company in New York, researchers plan to install the lamps near the ceilings in homeless shelters. For the next six years, scientists will measure the spread of the disease among people who use the shelters and compare the data to the numbers at similar shelters without the lamps.  <p>The program is expected to cost $4 million and will be formally announced later this month at a meeting of electric utilities. Some of the details, including precisely which shelters will be studied, have not been settled.</p> <p>Ultraviolet lamps are available commercially to kill germs in water, and for decades scientists have recognized that ultraviolet light works well on tuberculosis bacteria in air; that is why sanitariums used to sterilize their linen in sunlight. And there are laboratory tests that show that the lamps will kill bacteria in air. But no one has demonstrated the effectiveness of indoor ultraviolet lighting in slowing the spread of the disease. &#39;Nobody Bothered&#39;</p> <p>The study&#39;s organizer, Dr. Philip W. Brickner, chairman of the community medicine department at St. Vincent&#39;s Hospital, which specializes in bringing health care to the homeless, said that when he finished medical school in 1954, the lamps were widely believed to cut spread of the disease. &quot;But nobody bothered with it because drugs had come along,&quot; he said. Streptomycin became widely available in the late 1940&#39;s, after which drugs became the main treatment.</p> <p>For the next four decades tuberculosis was in steady decline, because drugs worked and because a general rise in living standards was helping to ameliorate the conditions in which the disease spreads. Doctors say those conditions are poor nutrition, crowding, poor ventilation and alcoholism. By 1985 the level declined to 22,200 new cases.</p> <p>But then it began rising. Dr. Brickner and colleagues at St. Vincent&#39;s documented the beginning of the re-emergence of the disease in 1977, among people who later came to be known as the homeless, who were often malnourished and overcrowded. Since the late 1970&#39;s, he said in an interview, &quot;the world has turned upside down,&quot; and those conditions have been widely re-created.</p> <p>Another problem is that some people with TB began treatments but did not follow through with them, which helped the bacteria mutate into resistant strains. Now there are strains that no drug will cure.</p> <p>And a new factor makes the disease more deadly: AIDS. Patients who have AIDS succumb quickly to TB, doctors say. Variety of Settings</p> <p>In 1992, the last year for which statistics are complete, the Federal Government counted 26,700 new cases of tuberculosis, a 20 percent jump from the low point in 1985. The victims come from a variety of settings. In 1991, researchers say, 13 prisoners and one prison guard died; in 1992 a flight attendant on Continental Airlines infected 23 crew members. Both prisons and airliners are good candidates for the ultraviolet technology, said Dr. Brickner; in fact, he said, any public building might benefit.</p> <p>Some hospitals and at least one shelter use ultraviolet light already. Dr. Edward A. Nardell, an adviser to the project and the tuberculosis control officer for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, said the Pine Street Inn, a shelter in Boston, had installed the lamps years ago.</p> <p>Ultraviolet light is not visible to the human eye, but the lamps also produce a faint bluish glow. Dr. Nardell said that at the Pine Street Inn the lamps produce a level of illumination &quot;like a night-light.&quot; The lamps send beams across the upper part of the room, and natural air circulation moves all the air through the beams bit by bit, he said.</p> <p>Placement of the lamps is important because some forms of ultraviolet light produced by the sun cause skin cancer and cataracts. Those forms, the kind that sunglasses and skin block are designed to protect against, are known as UV-A and UV-B. The kind that will be used in the shelter, called UV-C, is also made by the sun but cannot penetrate the earth&#39;s atmosphere. This is true even with the depletion of the ozone layer, which scientists blame for increased levels of UV-A and UV-B on the earth&#39;s surface.  &#39;The Full Whack&#39;</p> <p>According to Dr. Nardell, most of the UV-C stays near the ceiling, and of the portion that reaches room occupants, 95 percent is stopped by the stratum corneum, the layer of dead cells on the skin. But the bacterium in air, he said, &quot;is such a tiny droplet that it&#39;s not protected, and it gets the full whack of this energy.&quot;</p> <p>Dr. Brickner said that a person who intentionally stared at a source of UV-C could develop an irritation of the eye called conjunctivitis but that this would pass quickly.</p> <p>Dr. Brickner is to announce the program at a meeting later this month of the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif.</p> <p>The institute is always looking for new markets for electricity. But Arthur A. Kressner, manager of exploratory research and development at Consolidated Edison, said the amounts involved in this program were very small, only about one watt per 10 square feet of floor space, about a tenth the amount used for lighting. Utilities in Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Birmingham, Ala., may also participate, he said.</p> <p>The six cities have not been selected for the project. Dr. Brickner said a deciding factor would be the availability of two shelters in each city with similar populations and physical characteristics, like ventilation.</p> <p>An alternative to ultraviolet lighting, used by some hospitals and shelters, is increased ventilation. But, Dr. Nardell said in an interview, &quot;the problem with ventilation is you can only use so much air.&quot; And there are no good data on the effectiveness of added ventilation either, he said.</p>
1768300>U.S. Panel Sees Big Problems if Indian Point Reactors Close Closing the Indian Point nuclear reactors would make electricity more expensive, leave New York more vulnerable to natural gas shortages and add to pollution that causes global warming, according to a report released on Tuesday by a committee of the National Academy of Sciences. The committee said that there were no insurmountable technical obstacles to closing the plant. But it asserted that electric demand was growing so fast in the region, and building power plants was so difficult, that simply meeting power needs during peak periods would be a challenge even if the reactors stayed in operation.  <p>Congress provided $1 million for the study, under a bill sponsored by Nita M. Lowey, a Westchester Democrat who says the reactors should be closed because of the risk of a release of radiation through accident or terrorist attack.</p> <p>Despite the report&#39;s conclusion that closing Indian Point, which is about 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, would present major difficulties for the state, Ms. Lowey said in a phone interview that she was &#39;&#39;thrilled&#39;&#39; by its findings. &#39;&#39;To me, the bottom line is, where there&#39;s a will there&#39;s a way&#39;&#39; to close the plant, she said.</p> <p>She pointed out that the National Academy group said the extra costs from closing Indian Point would be &quot;modest,&quot; provided there is time to compensate, by building new plants or improving efficiency.</p> <p>In fact, the report emphasized the political problems of meeting the state&#39;s energy demands, with or without the reactors.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;While the committee is optimistic that technical solutions do exist for the replacement of Indian Point, it is considerably less confident that the necessary political, regulatory, financial and institutional mechanisms are in place to facilitate the timely implementation of these replacement options,&#39;&#39; the report said.</p> <p>The continuing fight over Indian Point comes as nuclear power is anticipating a renaissance, mainly because of the high price of natural gas. It has been nearly 30 years since the last plant was ordered, but nine companies have said publicly that they are considering building new ones around the country, including one in Scriba, N.Y., adjacent to the Nine Mile Point complex.</p> <p>At the moment building any power plant in New York State is difficult, the report said, because a law that laid out the process for environmental reviews and permits for new plants was allowed to expire in 2003.</p> <p>The amount of generating capacity under construction now is inadequate to meet peak demand in 2009, and the shortfall will be far larger if Indian Point closes, the report said. In seven to nine years, the area will need 3,000 megawatts of additional electric capacity if Indian Point is running, and 5,000 megawatts if it is not, the report said.</p> <p>One of the authors, Parker D. Mathusa, said in a telephone interview that there were big opportunities for improving efficiency of electric use and expanding electric production. But Mr. Mathusa, a member of the board of directors of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, said that &#39;&#39;to replace 2,000 megawatts of base-load power, very low-cost power, in a critical part of the country that is growing, with air quality that is some of the worst in the country, one would have to pause.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, which owns the reactors, said that it was no surprise that the panel found that Indian Point could be replaced. &#39;&#39;Of course you can do anything if you try hard enough,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;You can put a man on the moon, too. Whether that&#39;s the right thing to do or not, it doesn&#39;t really answer.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A business group supported by Entergy that favors operation of the plants, the New York Affordable Reliable Electricity Alliance, says that the report showed that shutting down the reactors would cause &#39;&#39;extreme economic and environmental sacrifices on the part of New Yorkers who are already faced with record high energy prices, poor air quality, and concerns over reliable sources of power in the near future,&#39;&#39; said Jerry Kremer, an advisor to the group.</p> <p>Mr. Kremer, a former state assemblyman who helped write the law that has expired, said: &#39;&#39;At the moment, there&#39;s no private capital being invested in New York for power plants. The communities don&#39;t want it and the siting law doesn&#39;t exist.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The report said one alternative to Indian Point was something else that environmentalists do not like: ports for tankers carrying liquefied natural gas. In fact, natural gas, which now sells for more than double its price in the late 1990&#39;s, is the only fuel practical for large-scale plants in the New York City area, according to experts, because coal or new reactors are not politically acceptable.</p> <p>And closing the reactors would run counter to another environmental effort, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which is supposed to start cutting carbon dioxide output in the region in 2008, the study said.</p> <p>The two reactors make up only about 5.3 percent of the state&#39;s generating capacity but they produce 10.1 percent of its energy, the study said, because they are low-cost producers and are run around the clock nearly all year long. Closing them would push electricity rates up, but it did not say how much.</p> <p>Some activists have tried for decades to close the plants, but the campaign drew more momentum after the attacks of Sept.11, 2001; American Airlines 11, the plane that hit the north tower of the World Trade Center, flew down the Hudson River, over Indian Point, on the way.</p> <p>Indian Point&#39;s two operating reactors have initial licenses that expire in 2013 and 2015, but Entergy, the owner, has invested heavily in both plants, working to raise their power output, and is expected to seek 20-year extensions of their licenses.</p> <p>The company is building a storage pad outside the buildings to house casks of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel, because the waste will soon fill the pools that were designed to hold it.</p> <p>The fuel has become a factor in the debate. As the report noted, if the reactors were closed, the vulnerability of the fuel to attack would not initially change. But Ms. Lowey pointed out that the fuel could be moved out of pools and into dry casks, perhaps at some distant location, a few years after the plant is shut; if the plant is never shut, she said, hazardous used fuel will always be on site.</p>
1767768>Uncertainty Surrounds Plans for New Nuclear Reactors The nuclear industry is poised to receive the first new orders for reactors in three decades, but what remains unclear is whether the smartest buyers will be those at the head of the line or a little farther back. The industry expects orders for a dozen or so new reactors. Since the last completed order was placed in 1973, much has changed. There are new designs, a new licensing system, new federal financial incentives, new costs and new risks, and no one is sure how the changes will play out as orders, or requests to build, are filed.  <p>For example, the federal government is offering &#39;&#39;risk insurance&#39;&#39; for the first six reactors, to protect builders against bureaucratic delays, with the biggest share of the insurance going to the first two. Loan guarantees are also possible, but probably only for the first few plants.</p> <p>Manufacturers have design costs that they will probably try to recoup from the first few reactors sold, increasing the cost. And no one seems eager to be the first to try out a radically different licensing system.</p> <p>Substantial questions remain about the predictability of the regulatory process, said James R. Curtiss, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who is a lawyer at Winston &amp; Strawn. The firm recently helped with an application for a license for a new uranium enrichment plant in New Mexico.</p> <p>Long delays occurred, Mr. Curtiss said, as new issues were argued before a three-judge administrative law panel and then went to the five-member commission for a ruling. Licensing a second plant will go much more smoothly, he said.</p> <p>Progress Energy, a utility based in Raleigh, N.C., has preliminary plans for four new reactors, and it could be the first to announce that it is applying for a license.</p> <p>But Keith Poston, a spokesman, said, &#39;&#39;One can imagine the benefits of not being first, and watching and learning from others.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The industry itself has taken steps to lower the stakes.</p> <p>For example, the energy bill created a production tax credit, a per-kilowatt-hour benefit, for the first 6,000 megawatts of new capacity, which would represent about five new reactors if applied on a first-come-first-served basis.</p> <p>The total value is about $1 billion over eight years. But the industry persuaded the Bush administration to spread the credit around, so it will be shared by all the plants that are announced by the end of 2008 and have construction under way by 2014, reducing the value of being first in line.</p> <p>Michael J. Wallace, the executive vice president at Constellation Energy, which is also contemplating a new reactor, said the industry&#39;s effort to spread the tax credit was intentional.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;This is not a race,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If I end up being the first, I&#39;m quite comfortable with that,&#39;&#39; Mr. Wallace said, because the incentives would offset the extra risks. &#39;&#39;If I&#39;m third, I&#39;m comfortable, because there is less incentive, but two guys will be two or three years in front of me.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The first buyer may get concessions from reactor vendors, who are eager to end a 33-year drought and position themselves for a big slice of the new market, which industry backers hope will include more than a dozen reactors in the next few years.</p> <p>But opponents of new plants predict doom for any company that tries to build a reactor, with the first likely to draw the most opposition.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s like volunteering for an experiment,&#39;&#39; said Paul Gunter, a nuclear reactor expert at the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, an antinuclear group. &#39;&#39;These first experimenters carry a lot of risk.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>One, Mr. Gunter said, is getting negative credit reviews from the bond rating agencies.</p> <p>Curt L. Hebert Jr., a former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission who is now an executive vice president of Entergy, a potential builder, sized it up the other way. &#39;&#39;I think the financial incentives and governmental guarantees certainly outweigh the risk,&#39;&#39; Mr. Hebert said. &#39;&#39;As we look at this, we see there being more risk in being third or fourth than being first or second.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>For all the companies, the biggest factor is the estimate of future electricity requirements, executives say. Next is the cost of competing technologies: the price of natural gas, as well as the price of coal, which is cheap but requires expensive pollution controls.</p> <p>Speaking of the various kinds of aid offered in last year&#39;s energy bill, Mr. Poston said, &#39;&#39;We would pursue incentives because they would be beneficial to customers and lower the project cost.&#39;&#39; That leaves open, however, whether going first is the lowest-cost option.</p> <p>While the risk and cost of some factors can be calculated, there are nonfinancial considerations as well, said Richard J. Myers, executive director of the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry&#39;s trade association. &#39;&#39;It reflects the C.E.O.&#39;s personality,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Some corporations want to be the pioneer, want to be the first one out there. They earn a footnote in the history books by doing so.&#39;&#39;</p>
1631608>Hydrogen Production Method Could Bolster Fuel Supplies Researchers at a government nuclear laboratory and a ceramics company in Salt Lake City say they have found a way to produce pure hydrogen with far less energy than other methods, raising the possibility of using nuclear power to indirectly wean the transportation system from its dependence on oil. The development would move the country closer to the Energy Department&#39;s goal of a &#39;&#39;hydrogen economy,&#39;&#39; in which hydrogen would be created through a variety of means, and would be consumed by devices called fuel cells, to make electricity to run cars and for other purposes. Experts cite three big roadblocks to a hydrogen economy: manufacturing hydrogen cleanly and at low cost, finding a way to ship it and store it on the vehicles that use it, and reducing the astronomical price of fuel cells.  <p>&#39;&#39;This is a breakthrough in the first part,&#39;&#39; said J. Stephen Herring, a consulting engineer at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, which plans to announce the development on Monday with Cerametec Inc. of Salt Lake City.</p> <p>The developers also said the hydrogen could be used by oil companies to stretch oil supplies even without solving the fuel cell and transportation problems.</p> <p>Mr. Herring said the experimental work showed the &#39;&#39;highest-known production rate of hydrogen by high-temperature electrolysis.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But the plan requires the building of a new kind of nuclear reactor, at a time when the United States is not even building conventional reactors. And the cost estimates are uncertain.</p> <p>The heart of the plan is an improvement on the most convenient way to make hydrogen, which is to run electric current through water, splitting the H2O molecule into hydrogen and oxygen. This process, called electrolysis, now has a drawback: if the electricity comes from coal, which is the biggest source of power in this country, then the energy value of the ingredients -- the amount of energy given off when the fuel is burned -- is three and a half to four times larger than the energy value of the product. Also, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions increase when the additional coal is burned.</p> <p>Hydrogen can also be made by mixing steam with natural gas and breaking apart both molecules, but the price of natural gas is rising rapidly.</p> <p>The new method involves running electricity through water that has a very high temperature. As the water molecule breaks up, a ceramic sieve separates the oxygen from the hydrogen. The resulting hydrogen has about half the energy value of the energy put into the process, the developers say. Such losses may be acceptable, or even desirable, because hydrogen for a nuclear reactor can be substituted for oil, which is imported and expensive, and because the basic fuel, uranium, is plentiful.</p> <p>The idea is to build a reactor that would heat the cooling medium in the nuclear core, in this case helium gas, to about 1,000 degrees Celsius, or more than 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. The existing generation of reactors, used exclusively for electric generation, use water for cooling and heat it to only about 300 degrees Celsius.</p> <p>The hot gas would be used two ways. It would spin a turbine to make electricity, which could be run through the water being separated. And it would heat that water, to 800 degrees Celsius. But if electricity demand on the power grid ran extremely high, the hydrogen production could easily be shut down for a few hours, and all of the energy could be converted to electricity, designers say.</p> <p>The goal is to create a reactor that could produce about 300 megawatts of electricity for the grid, enough to run about 300,000 window air-conditioners, or produce about 2.5 kilos of hydrogen per second. When burned, a kilo of hydrogen has about the same energy value as a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline. But fuel cells, which work without burning, get about twice as much work out of each unit of fuel. So if used in automotive fuel cells, the reactor might replace more than 400,000 gallons of gasoline per day.</p> <p>The part of the plan that the laboratory and the ceramics company have tested is high-temperature electrolysis. There is only limited experience building high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, though, and no one in this country has ordered any kind of big reactor, even those of more conventional design, in 30 years, except for those whose construction was canceled before completion.</p> <p>Another problem is that the United States has no infrastructure for shipping large volumes of hydrogen. Currently, most hydrogen is produced at the point where it is used, mostly in oil refineries. Hydrogen is used to draw the sulfur out of crude oil, and to break up hydrocarbon molecules that are too big for use in liquid fuel, and change the carbon-hydrogen ratio to one more favorable for vehicle fuel.</p> <p>Mr. Herring suggested another use, however: recovering usable fuel from the Athabasca Tar Sands in Alberta, Canada. The reserves there may hold the largest oil deposits in the world, but extracting them and converting them into a gasoline substitute requires copious amounts of steam and hydrogen, both products of the reactor.</p>
777833>Radioactive Spill on the Hudson The Indian Point nuclear power plant dumped a small amount of radioactive material into the Hudson River on Tuesday after Consolidated Edison workers left a valve open, allowing thousands of gallons of clean water to wash over soil contaminated by previous leaks. The amount of radioactivity released was well below the limit allowed under the plant&#39;s operating license, a spokesman for Consolidated Edison Company, Michael J. Spall, said yesterday. But the plant is reviewing its procedures to prevent a recurrence.  <p>The incident occurred at Indian Point 1, which was retired in 1974. It is not scheduled to be cleaned up until Indian Point 2, on the same site in Buchanan, is shut.</p> <p>The incident, which the company reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, began at an outdoor tank that the utility uses to store drinkable water from the municipal water system, for use in fighting fires. The tank&#39;s level control mechanism was faulty, so workers turned it off to fix it, Mr. Spall said, but they neglected to shut off the incoming water. The tank filled and thousands of gallons of water spilled.</p> <p>The outdoor drain into which the water flowed is contaminated because over the years, water has leaked from the spent-fuel pool, where the used fuel is kept.</p> <p>The problem was then complicated because of a previous decision by Con Ed intended to minimize the spread of contamination: the drain directs runoff into the reactor building for treatment.</p> <p>However, the treatment system was overwhelmed by the spilled water, coming at hundreds of gallons a minute, according to the utility. So the water picked up more contamination from the reactor floor before flowing into the Hudson.</p>
1718936>Lawmakers See Possible Illegality in Firing of Amtrak Leader Days after Amtrak&#39;s board of directors fired the railroad&#39;s president, the chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees Amtrak said Tuesday that the board might have acted illegally because it lacked a quorum. Yet the chairman of the panel, Representative Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio, was among the mildest of the critics at a hearing that ran more than two and a half hours. A parade of Republicans and Democrats denounced the board for firing the president, David L. Gunn, who had earned widespread praise for stabilizing Amtrak&#39;s operations.  <p>Amtrak&#39;s board chairman and the Transportation Department&#39;s representatives on the board sat stoically through the hearing. Places were set for two other members of the board, but they did not appear.</p> <p>The unpopular move by the directors has focused attention on their legal status. Mr. LaTourette, head of the railroad subcommittee of the House transportation panel, said the board had apparently not had a quorum in the last few years. He said that under the board&#39;s bylaws, a quorum would be five of seven directors. The board has only four directors, and two of those will lose their seats when Congress recesses for the year in a few weeks.</p> <p>The Transportation Department&#39;s chief counsel, Jeffrey A. Rosen, who also serves on the Amtrak board as the representative of the transportation secretary, disputed Mr. LaTourette on that point and others. But others at the hearing, some seeking to reinstate Mr. Gunn, seized on the procedural questions surrounding the board.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You&#39;ve opened up a whole Pandora&#39;s box,&#39;&#39; said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia&#39;s delegate to the House and a member of the transportation committee, addressing David M. Laney, the board chairman.</p> <p>Ms. Norton described the board&#39;s uncertain legal status as &#39;&#39;a lawsuit waiting to happen.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said he had written to the White House to recommend that Mr. Gunn be reinstated until lawyers could determine the status of the directors. &#39;&#39;There is no clear legal consensus that the board had the power to fire Mr. Gunn,&#39;&#39; Mr. Schumer testified.</p> <p>Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, linked the firing of Mr. Gunn to a bill recently approved by the Senate, on a 93 to 6 vote, that would authorize a multiyear spending package for the railroad, against the Bush administration&#39;s wishes. Mr. Lautenberg, who sponsored the bill with Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, said the board had fired Mr. Gunn as &#39;&#39;retribution for our misbehavior.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Laney and Mr. Rosen, the only board members who have spoken publicly, have said Amtrak should not expect annual subsidies from Congress forever. That idea was supported by only one committee member, Representative John Mica, Republican of Florida.</p> <p>Exactly why Mr. Gunn was fired after three and a half years on the job was not completely clear. Mr. Gunn said it was because he had opposed the board&#39;s preliminary moves to strip Amtrak of the tracks in the Northeast Corridor, from Washington through New York to Boston.</p> <p>Mr. Laney denied that that was the board&#39;s intention. He said Mr. Gunn had lost enthusiasm for contracting out food service and train maintenance, adding that those steps would cut losses and were part of a strategic plan approved by the board in April. Mr. Gunn said he had worked hard to help write that plan and was deeply involved in carrying out parts of it that the railroad could accomplish on its own.</p> <p>Mr. Laney acknowledged that the board had hired an outside public relations firm to announce that Mr. Gunn was being fired. Mr. LaTourette said Amtrak was obligated by law to tell Congress about the hiring of the firm because it was a form of lobbying Congress.</p>
499667>Gulf States Utilities Names Key Manager to Top Posts The Gulf States Utilities Company, the Texas-based power provider that has been in financial trouble since it finished a nuclear plant in 1986 in the midst of a regional recession, yesterday named Joseph L. Donnelly as chief executive. Mr. Donnelly, senior executive vice president and a chief architect of the company&#39;s partial recovery, will also become chairman on March 1.  <p>Mr. Donnelly, 62, who has been with the company since being hired in 1979 as senior vice president for finance, replaces E. Linn Draper, who is leaving as chairman, president and chief executive to become president of the American Electric Power Company, in Columbus, Ohio.</p> <p>Gulf States, based in Beaumont, Tex., serves a 28,000-square-mile area between Houston and New Orleans with a population of 1.3 million. It was &quot;tottering on the verge of bankruptcy&quot; in 1986 and 1987, Mr. Donnelly said yesterday, because it completed its River Bend reactor, in St. Francisville, La., at a higher cost than planned, just as a recession was cutting power demand.</p> <p>The recession made it harder to raise rates, he said. &quot;We&#39;ve been in rate proceedings for years and years and years,&quot; he said. &quot;We had a mismatch of revenues and obligations.&quot;</p> <p>The company cut stock dividends in 1986 and 1987 to conserve cash and sought a merger. By last year, its condition improved and it paid off $127 million of the $252 million it owed on back dividends on preferred and preference stock. Mr. Donnelly said Gulf States would like to pay off the rest in 1992.</p> <p>Mr. Donnelly holds a bachelor&#39;s degree in political science from the University of Scranton and a doctor of jurisprudence degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He was a deputy attorney general of Pennsylvania from 1955 to 1958, after which he joined the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, where he held a variety of posts until coming to Gulf States.</p> <p>BUSINESS PEOPLE</p>
562938>RULES REWRITTEN ON NUCLEAR WASTE Frustrated with delays in establishing a nuclear waste repository in the Nevada desert, Congress has laid out new standards that could be the basis of a radical departure from current thinking about storing the highly radioactive waste from civilian and military reactors. One provision in the energy bill passed by Congress last week and expected to be signed by President Bush would make the Secretary of Energy the custodian of the waste for the indefinite future; under previous plans, the repository was to be sealed up and eventually abandoned.  <p>Another provision would allow the Federal Government to discard a philosophy that scientists and government agencies have used for years to calculate the hazards of small doses of dangerous substances.</p> <p>Both changes are meant to smooth the way for establishing a waste dump at Yucca Mountain, near Las Vegas, Nev., by loosening the standards required for licensing a repository there. The language was inserted in the energy package by the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, while the bill was in a House-Senate conference committee; the Energy Department, which is to build the repository, is still analyzing the changes. The Forgetful Future</p> <p>The idea behind the first change in the new measure -- placing Yucca Mountain under the continuous care of the Secretary of Energy -- is to eliminate a critical problem in waste-disposal planning: that future generations will forget where the repository is located. Fear of intrusion in the distant future is one of the main reasons behind the international consensus that radioactive waste must be buried under deep layers of strong rock.</p> <p>&quot;There has always been an assumption that you can&#39;t be certain that the knowledge of the location of a site will still be around in 10,000 years,&quot; said William Gunter of the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s Office of Radiation and Indoor Air. &quot;Not that we guarantee society will forget,&quot; he said, &quot;but we don&#39;t guarantee they&#39;ll remember, either.&quot;</p> <p>Under the new bill, the Energy Department would be expected to provide just such a guarantee. Asked if this removed the prime reason for burying the waste, the department did not respond directly. Instead, it cited the regulations in force before Congress passed the new law, which say the department must keep the repository open for monitoring for 50 years.</p> <p>Under the new language, the National Academy of Sciences, an independent body chartered by Congress, is supposed to examine whether a continuous &quot;institutional&quot; presence is feasible, and advise the Environmental Protection Agency, which would write the regulations under which a license would be granted. But at the same time, the Secretary of Energy is told to establish such a presence.</p> <p>On the floor of the Senate, Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who heads the Environment and Public Works subcommittee on nuclear regulation, complained that the new language sent &quot;the message that the procedures and standards for the protection of the public health and safety for nuclear waste disposal are just items to be horse-traded in the political process.&quot;  Playing Down the Hypothetical</p> <p>But at the American Nuclear Energy Council, a lobbying group, Edward M. Davis, a spokesman, said that in developing the rules the E.P.A. had raised &quot;hypothetical scenarios&quot; that Yucca Mountain could not meet. The new standards, he went on, simply removed these unrealistic considerations -- for example, that someone would someday drill an oil well into the repository and breach a storage container.</p> <p>In the second change, the new law calls for establishing a maximum permissible dose of radiation that any individual may receive as a result of leaks from Yucca Mountain but does not mention a limit on the total dose to the population.</p> <p>Critics say that would mark a major departure in the philosophy of regulation. Until now, scientists have always assumed that any amount of radiation is harmful, so a leak that exposed a huge number of people to small amounts of radiation could produce more deaths than a leak that exposed a small number of people to larger doses. The E.P.A. had used just that assumption in drafting rules for a waste repository.</p> <p>Mr. Davis, of the American Nuclear Energy Council, said this, too, was meant to get around an unrealistic supposition. Planners are assuming very small leakage, he said, but multiplied by 10,000 years, the dose to the population would be substantial. But since no one lives for 10,000 years, he went on, the calculation is irrelevant.</p> <p>Dan Reicher, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, points out that the new language is drafted to apply only to Yucca Mountain. Yucca Mountain has not been designated as the waste repository, but only as the first site whose suitability will be investigated for that purpose.</p> <p>The Government has already built another repository, for plutonium-contaminated bomb wastes. That repository, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, near Carlsbad, N.M., would hold a far smaller quantity of radioactive material, but would have to stand up to tougher rules.</p>
834828>Rare Testing on a 737 Seeks Elusive Answers to a Crash Air safety investigators have begun highly unusual tests on a parked Boeing 737, forcing parts askew with hydraulic arms and clipping vital control cables,  in an effort to determine why another 737 owned by USAir fell out of the sky near Pittsburgh in September 1994. The investigation of that crash, which killed all 132 people on board, is already the most extensive in the 29-year history of the National Transportation Safety Board. And given the questions remaining, it is in a sense the most worrisome, because the 737 is the most popular jet in the sky.  <p>The safety board finds the cause of almost all crashes by looking at the wreckage, the flight data recorders, radar records and similar evidence. But in  this case, that has not been enough.</p> <p>So the investigators have undertaken the new testing. They are using a plane, already removed from service by USAir, that the airline plans to donate to the Museum of Flight, in Seattle, where the tests are now under way. The museum is across a runway from a Boeing plant, and Boeing is lending assistance.</p> <p>&quot;What we&#39;re doing to this airplane is unprecedented,&quot; James Hall, the safety  board&#39;s chairman, said by telephone from Seattle as the tests began on Thursday.</p> <p>The 737 that crashed was approaching Pittsburgh when it abruptly rolled to the left and plunged.  Investigators say its trajectory through the sky can be explained by a sustained swing of the rudder -- the movable surface on the vertical tail -- and by nothing else that they can identify.</p> <p>It is not clear, though, how the rudder could have malfunctioned. So technicians have pulled the floor out of the passenger cabin of the test plane,  enabling them to see the cables that link the pedals at the pilot&#39;s feet with the rudder in the back of the plane.</p> <p>If the cables do not snap because of the forces applied to them during the tests, engineers will cut them and measure the sound. The goal is to try to duplicate sounds captured by the cockpit voice recorder just before the crash, and to see precisely what effect a snapped cable might have had on the doomed plane.</p> <p>That plane carried an early-model flight data recorder, which captured only 11 kinds of data; it did not record the position of the rudder or of the rudder  controls. In contrast, newer data recorders capture dozens of kinds of data and  usually point crash investigators toward the root of the problem very quickly.</p> <p>The airlines argue that wiring planes to capture more data would require taking them out of service for long periods, at high cost. But in the conversation from Seattle, Mr. Hall said, &quot;I just hope the aircraft industry and the Federal Aviation Administration will take appropriate action so we are never in a position again where it would take us this much time and effort&quot; to get to the bottom of a crash.</p> <p>Investigators are looking for some combination of problems on three systems that can move the plane: the main rudder-control mechanism, a backup mechanism and a yaw damper, which is a computer-operated automatic system that makes small adjustments in the rudder to keep the plane&#39;s nose and tail lined up in precisely the direction that the plane is moving.</p> <p>One reason for the new tests is that investigators say they may not fully understand the significance of an event that occurred just before the crash: the USAir plane flew through the wake of a 737 that was 4.2 nautical miles ahead.</p> <p>Such wake encounters are common, but investigators think this one may have put a force on the plane that somehow caused a fatal chain of events.</p>
1772559>A New Wrinkle in Hybrids Does Away With Batteries BY now, hybrid vehicles are familiar enough that buyers find nothing peculiar about a car&#39;s gasoline engine getting help from an electric motor. But just as drivers have grown comfortable with concepts like regenerative braking and issues like battery life expectancy, new types of hybrids are emerging -- including one that uses no electricity at all.  <p>For instance, a United Parcel Service delivery truck the government rolled out in Washington last week was equipped with a prototype hybrid system using hydraulic fluid and a high-pressure pump instead of electrical current and a generator. In this design, energy is stored in a series of pressurized tanks, rather than in nickel-metal hydride or lithium-ion batteries; the energy moves not as high voltage current in copper wires but as hydraulic fluid pressurized to thousands of pounds per square inch.</p> <p>Standing next to the truck painted with U.P.S.&#39;s signature color, Stephen L. Johnson, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said: &#39;&#39;Brown is the new green.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Army is testing a truck with similar technology and FedEx is watching with interest. The E.P.A., which holds some patents on the technology, has visions of full-size sedans that will go 80 miles on a gallon of gasoline, with better acceleration and lower emissions, at a cost premium so small that fuel savings will quickly pay for the hybrid hardware.</p> <p>A hydraulic hybrid is more specialized than the gasoline-electric hybrids sold today. It works better on heavier vehicles, and in stop-and-go traffic; backers say the ideal vehicle for this system is a garbage truck, but that it could work well in vehicles as small as S.U.V.&#39;s.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;ve always said there&#39;s a lot of flavors of hybrid,&#39;&#39; said Bill Van Amberg, executive vice president of WestStart, a government-industry research consortium.</p> <p>The hydraulic hybrid is conceptually similar to battery-electric hybrids like the Toyota Prius or the Honda Civic. It has an internal combustion engine, and its design makes it possible to store power for a while before sending it to the wheels.</p> <p>When the driver presses the brake pedal, the storage system may engage, slowing the vehicle by capturing the energy of its forward motion rather than using the brakes. This design, known as regenerative braking, is more efficient than conventional friction brakes which simply convert the vehicle&#39;s momentum into wasted heat. The captured energy can be stored and returned to the wheels when the traffic light turns green.</p> <p>A hydraulic hybrid has several advantages. One is that it can accept and deliver huge amounts of energy quickly, which batteries cannot. And its storage ability does not degrade over time, which is a fact of life with batteries available today. Generally speaking, though, hydraulic systems do not store as much total energy as an electrical battery does, because the storage tanks are bulky.</p> <p>The U.P.S. van has four &#39;&#39;accumulator tanks&#39;&#39; of 22 gallons each which can be pressurized as high as 5,000 pounds. When fully charged, the system holds 2,000 horsepower-seconds of energy, according to Benjamin M. Hoxie, engineering manager for hydraulic hybrids at Eaton, an automotive supplier that built the prototype, using technology developed by the E.P.A..</p> <p>Stated differently, it could deliver 100 horsepower for about 20 seconds. In electrical terms, that is less than half a kilowatt hour -- but no electric battery could absorb and deliver energy so quickly.</p> <p>When the truck is in operation, its diesel engine runs a pump to fill the storage tanks with fluid. The tanks contain nitrogen gas to When the driver presses on the accelerator, pressurized fluid is released from the high pressure tank and routed to the pump. The pressurized fluid pushes a piston down in its cylinder, recycling some of the energy to turn the vehicle&#39;s wheels.</p> <p>The company says that because the diesel engine runs at constant speed, it will have a head start in meeting the stricter pollution standards that take effect in 2010.</p> <p>The prototype truck has a 6-liter V-8 diesel engine but Eaton engineers say that with the hybrid system it could use a much smaller engine and still get the same performance; soon they will try a 4.5-liter V-6. But even using the existing engine, the truck is expected save about 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel a year, the company says.</p> <p>Hydraulic hybrids use technology that has been in service for decades, and unlike a computer-controlled Prius, they might not require a mechanic with an engineering degree to do repairs.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Mine can be fixed by a 19-year-old,&#39;&#39; said James A. O&#39;Brien, president of Hybra-Drive Systems of Deerfield, Mich., who has converted a 1965 Volkswagen Beetle to a hydraulic hybrid as a test project. &#39;&#39;It can work with no electronics at all,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>In fact, the E.P.A. truck has no battery beyond the conventional one that turns the starter motor and lights the headlamps.</p> <p>Simplicity impresses Robert K. Hall, the fleet environmental manager for U.P.S. His company, a veritable Noah&#39;s Ark of oddball vehicles, began its experiments in the 1930&#39;s with electric vans.</p> <p>U.P.S., which operates nearly 92,000 vehicles worldwide that cover two billion miles a year runs about 1,500 alternative vehicles, most using compressed natural gas or propane, but it also has tractor-trailer trucks running on liquefied natural gas, delivery vans running on fuel cells and conventional gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles. The company calculated recently that its alternative fuel trucks had driven 108 million miles since 2000.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Every one we&#39;re running is working O.K.,&#39;&#39; Mr. Hall said. The hydraulic hybrid, unlike the electric one, has &#39;&#39;fittings and high pressure hoses you can easily inspect to ensure they are functioning properly,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>FedEx is a bit behind, but not much. Mitch Jackson, managing director of environmental programs, said that hydraulic hybrids &#39;&#39;have the potential to play a very significant role.&#39;&#39; He said that the systems had an advantage over alternatives in heavy stop-and-go traffic.</p> <p>The Army, always interested in technologies that would cut fuel needs on the battlefield, has tested a heavy truck with hydraulic drive built in part by Permo-Drive Inc., the American subsidiary of a company with the same name in New South Wales, Australia. Jim Borovac, the president of the subsidiary, said it allowed the use of a relatively small engine, while the truck still had the power to accelerate up steep grades.</p> <p>At the introduction of the U.P.S. truck, Eaton announced that by next year it would commercialize a related technology, a &quot;hybrid launch assist,&#39;&#39; which could be retrofitted on existing vehicles. It would capture braking energy and deliver it to the wheels again when it was time to accelerate.</p> <p>GREEN TECH</p>
341084>Report Outlines Options For U.S. Energy Policy For the first time since the late 1970&#39;s, the Federal Government has begun trying to develop a comprehensive energy policy - a system of strategies, goals, inducements and penalties covering everything from how much oil should be produced domestically to the amount of light each watt of electricity should yield.  <p>But the first report in this effort, a compendium of opinions compiled by the Energy Department and scheduled for release this morning in Washington, contains a welter of conflicting advice and hints at a rough road ahead.</p> <p>The report comes at the midpoint of an 18-month process to develop legislative proposals. It contains written submissions from 1,000 individuals and organizations and summaries of the testimony of 379 witnesses at 16 hearings held in locations like Atlanta, Honolulu and Boise, Idaho.</p> <p>A Case for Efficiency</p> <p>The compendium leaves for later the job of putting goals in order of importance and making choices between alternatives. But it clearly sets the stage for action on energy efficiency.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;People are not willing to pay more for energy, either environmentally or economically, unless they are first convinced that you have no choice,&#39;&#39; W. Henson Moore, Deputy Secretary of Energy, said in a telephone interview Friday. &#39;&#39;They say, &#39;What are you doing to increase the efficiency in the use of energy, so we do not have to do this?&#39; You&#39;re never going to get a consensus until you establish your credibility in that area, that you&#39;re really serious about efficiency.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Still, the report offers no conclusions about how efficiency should be achieved. Its first section, for example, notes that vehicle fuel economy, prodded by Federal standards, more than doubled between 1970 and 1987, but that at current fuel prices, a 10 mile-a-gallon improvement in gas mileage would save a typical driver only $94 a year. The options identified by those who testified range from making the standards more stringent to abandoning them altogether.</p> <p>Critical Time for Oil</p> <p>The effort to establish a comprehensive plan, which is supposed to conclude next January, comes as domestic oil production has fallen and imports have rapidly approached 50 percent of demand for the first time. Some experts have predicted that market conditions once again favor price control by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p> <p>In addition to those trends, some parts of the country appear to be approaching a critical juncture in electricity production. As demand increases, these regions face decisions about whether to build more plants or reduce demand through efficiency, or accept a higher likelihood of occasional blackouts. Other pressing policy questions include how to reduce air pollution from energy use.</p> <p>As part of the process of gathering the contents of the report, James D. Watkins, the Energy Secretary, and Mr. Moore held meetings that included the Secretaries or Under Secretaries of Agriculture, Transportation, Treasury and Interior, as well as the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the White House science adviser.</p> <p>More hearings are contemplated, with competing interests offering their positions on what the policy should include.</p> <p>The 230-page interim report charts the view of business executives, academicians, advocacy groups and other experts on the problems and possibilities for oil, gas, coal, nuclear fission and fusion, renewable energy sources, scientific research, technology transfer, waste handling, air and water pollution from energy extraction and use, and even energy education.</p> <p>To this, the Energy Department added five white papers written by Government laboratories and others covering the greenhouse effect, the potential for renewable energy and the limits of energy efficiency.</p> <p>Mr. Moore said that the effort was the most comprehensive he had seen the Federal Government undertake. &#39;&#39;The closest thing to it was in the Carter Administration,&#39;&#39; he said.</p>
341851>Industry Wary of Clean-Air Bill Industrial companies across America reacted with varying degrees of pessimism to the clean-air legislation passed by the Senate on Tuesday. They are resigned to paying billions of dollars in additional pollution-control costs but warn that those costs will be passed on to consumers.  <p>The bill, which appears likely to be the basis of the first Federal clean-air law since 1977, would require auto makers, chemical manufacturers, steelmakers and coal-fired power plants, among others, to make substantial investments in equipment and processes to lower their pollution. The Senate bill now goes to the House of Representatives, where several industries hope for amendments that will make it less stringent. But environmentalists see the House debate as an opportunity for strengthening the legislation. The version of the bill now in a House committee would impose stricter limits in some areas.</p> <p>The Administration estimates that the cost will be $20 billion a year. Yet some corporations said that more than money is at stake. They said they were not sure how to meet the new requirements at any reasonable cost. Here are the viewpoints of four industries on the legislation.</p> <p>The Auto Industry</p> <p>Jump in Cost Seen For Consumers</p> <p>Auto industry representatives said yesterday that the measure approved by the Senate included standards for the equipment that controls tailpipe emissions that would stretch the limits of their technology and cost consumers a minimum of hundreds of dollars extra for each car.</p> <p>But those interviewed stopped short of saying the Senate was placing impossible limits on the industry. However, vigorous lobbying in Congress for a less restrictive bill appeared certain, they said.</p> <p>Thomas Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, an industry trade group, said, &#39;&#39;It&#39;s an extraordinarily tough bill but it&#39;s the best we thought we could get from the Senate, given where some of the parties were.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The provision in the Senate bill that seems most worrisome to auto makers is a requirement that makes standards for auto tailpipe emissions applicable for 10 years or 100,000 miles starting in 1993, doubling the current longevity standard. The tailpipe standards would reduce oxides of nitrogen 60 percent from the current level and hydrocarbons by 40 percent.</p> <p>A second round of tailpipe-emission reductions in the year 2004 would halve the 1993 level.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Anything mechanical deteriorates, especially something underneath a car,&#39;&#39; said Rob Liberatore, a government relations specialist for the Chrysler Corporation, referring to a car&#39;s catalytic converter, which removes pollutants from engine emissions. &#39;&#39;To engineer a system that can last this long it has to meet very, very low standards when it&#39;s new so it still meets the limits after a decade.&#39;&#39; Can Standards Be Met?  Automotive engineers are reluctant to estimate the cost of a pollution-control system that meets the 100,000-mile standard, but Mr. Liberatore said the additional rare metals and other costs certainly would amount to &#39;&#39;several hundred dollars&#39;&#39; a car, which auto makers say they would pass on to consumers.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;re not sure if we can meet the standard,&#39;&#39; said Donald R. Buist, director of emissions and fuel economy for the Ford Motor Company. &#39;&#39;If we can&#39;t, we&#39;ll have to go back and see the Government again,&#39;&#39; he said, referring to the mid-1970&#39;s, when auto makers obtained a relaxation of regulations because they were not able to meet pollution-control standards.</p> <p>Auto makers are also wary of a provision in the Senate measure that requires special canisters for cars to trap fumes lost during refueling. The canisters would add $80 to $100 to the cost of a car and the auto makers say they pose a safety hazard in an accident. Instead, the Big Three prefer the solution used in California: a special hose at each gas tank that catches the vapors and collects them underground.</p> <p>But the auto makers said their picture was not entirely bleak. The Senate failed to impose a fuel-economy provision mandating that each car maker&#39;s fleet reach an average of 40 miles a gallon, up from the current 27.5 miles a gallon. That much-discussed proposal is aimed at reducing carbon-dioxide emissions thought to contribute to global warming, by cutting the consumption of gasoline. Auto makers have warned that it could force an end to big-car production. The Senate also did not mandate the production of alternative-fuel cars like those that would burn methanol, which the Environmental Protection Agency had favored.</p> <p>DORON P. LEVIN</p> <p>The Utilities</p> <p>Delay Is Sought On Cleaner Coal</p> <p>The bill approved by the Senate is intended to reduce acid rain by cutting 10 million tons a year of sulfur dioxide from the smokestacks of power plants, half of it from generators in the Midwest that burn high-sulfur coal. In addition, companies would be limited after the year 2000 to the amount of sulfur dioxide they emitted in 1985.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We are extremely disappointed,&#39;&#39; said Thomas S. Ayres of American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, which serves seven million people in seven states and is in some years the nation&#39;s largest purchaser of coal. The company has not had time to analyze the effect of this legislation, he said, but an earlier proposal that would have cut the same amount of sulfur dioxide would have cost $750 million a year. That would be equal to nearly 15 percent of revenues.</p> <p>If electric prices increased by a similar percentage, the company&#39;s residential rate would rise to about 7 cents a kilowatt-hour, which is still a penny under the national average price. Defending the proposed cleanup, William Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said yesterday that costs would rise for the utilities that are the biggest polluters. But he said that even after the increases, &#39;&#39;almost everywhere, the rates in those areas will be competitive with adjacent areas that have met the performance standards already.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But coal-burning utilities think the standards could be met at less cost if Congress would delay action while cleaner ways to burn coal are developed. The alternative is to put &#39;&#39;scrubbers&#39;&#39; on existing plants, which are costly to build and require vast amounts of electricity to run.</p> <p>Another controversial point is the choice of 1985 as the base year. At the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association in Washington, Mary Kenkel, a spokeswoman, said that a recession in the industry in 1985 reduced electricity generation - and thus emissions - to unusually low levels.</p> <p>Ms. Kenkel and others also complain that the Senate legislation is inflexible. For example, at the Centerior Energy Corporation, which serves more than a million customers in northern Ohio and relies on coal to meet 70 percent of its load, Lee Bailey, a spokesman, complained that the proposed law sets a limit for each plant. &#39;&#39;If we could average over our entire system, it would give us the possibility of scrubbing our two biggest coal units to meet the goal,&#39;&#39; he said. That would be just as effective as putting less-efficient scrubbers on each plant and it would be cheaper, he said.</p> <p>Complaint on Standards</p> <p>But not only the most polluting utilities have objections. At Wisconsin Electric, which is 60 percent coal-fired, Lisa Berman, a spokeswoman, said the company had reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 46 percent since 1980, and already meets the standards that would come into effect by 1995 under the legislation voted by the Senate. &#39;&#39;We want to have credit for what we&#39;ve done so far,&#39;&#39; she said.</p> <p>For a second round of reductions, taking effect in 2000, Wisconsin Electric would have to switch to lower-sulfur coal or install new equipment or both, at a cost of $125 million to $135 million, she said, raising rates by 8 to 13 percent. The company might retire one of its older coal-fired plants, she said.</p> <p>Utilities facing growth also complained. At the Florida Power and Light Company, where a growing population is pushing up demand by 4 percent a year, company executives say that the choice of 1985 is especially unfortunate for them because in that year all four of their nuclear plants ran very well, with little time lost for refueling. As a result, they got 35 percent of their power from that sulfur-free source, a percentage that they do not think they can match now.</p> <p>What the Florida utility would have to do under the proposed legislation is buy the right to emit more pollutants than it did in 1985, according to Gary G. Mehalik, a spokesman. A section in the proposed legislation would allow a company in the Midwest to clean up a coal plant even more stringently than the law requires and &#39;&#39;sell&#39;&#39; the difference. If, for example, a utility in Illinois cut emissions by 1,000 tons a year more than was required, it could sell to Florida Power the right to emit that 1,000 tons.</p> <p>But he said, &#39;&#39;Our interest is in having our customers protected from having to pay for cleaning up other people&#39;s plants.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>MATTHEW L. WALD</p> <p>The Chemical Industry</p> <p>Permit Process Called a Nightmare</p> <p>Chemical manufacturers and the trade groups representing them reacted warily yesterday to the clean-air legislation passed by the Senate. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s no doubt we are talking about millions of dollars of spending requirements but we haven&#39;t made an estimate of the impact on us because so much could change,&#39;&#39; said David Graham, Dow Chemical&#39;s environmental issues manager in Washington.</p> <p>Chemical manufacturers, most of which are major consumers of electricity, say the bill&#39;s provisions to reduce acid rain will drive up their energy costs. But the biggest direct impact will come from the provisions dealing with toxic emissions. The most frequently cited areas of concern were the rules for when a permit is necessary, the requirements for applying the best technology available to control the release of toxic chemicals and the process for establishing how high a residual risk for cancer-causing emissions would be acceptable after such control technology had been applied.</p> <p>Trade groups say the provisions governing the permit process in the Senate bill may be a nightmare, especially for smaller companies. Companies must not only apply for permission to use processes that emit toxic chemicals but also must seek new permits every time the equipment is altered.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We are concerned with the Draconian enforcement measures, especially things like jail terms and massive fines for paperwork violations,&#39;&#39; said Ronald Lang, executive director of the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association. &#39;&#39;Smaller companies don&#39;t have four lawyers backing people up to make sure everything is mailed.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Impact on Innovation Feared</p> <p>Mr. Graham at Dow said the lack of priorities in the procedures for issuing permits meant that applications for new processes that a company needs to build a new plant or extend a product line might become tied up in piles of requests from other companies - even for something as small as permission to shift the route of a section of piping for routine maintenance. He said companies will be discouraged from making small changes, thus slowing the pace of innovation.</p> <p>More broadly, several manufacturers said they feared that the requirements that companies use the best available control technology would not be flexible enough to account for the huge variety of chemicals and processes for dealing with them. Standardizing the required technology could drive up expenses for some companies while producing few reductions in emissions.</p> <p>The bill refers the problem of how to calculate the impact of toxic air emissions on health to the National Academy of Science. At issue is what standards should be applied to residual emissions after industry has met the first-phase goal of cutting emissions by 90 percent. If Congress does not act within five years on the recommendations it receives on how to determine such standards, the provisions now in the bill apply. The chemical industry contends that the current criteria are unreliable and that if they are retained, plants may be needlessly threatened with closure.</p> <p>&#39;Paying Lip Service&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;By referring the matter to N.A.S. but not leaving the standard up to them, Congress is paying lip service to science,&#39;&#39; said Jeffrey Van, a spokesman for the Chemical Manufacturers Association.</p> <p>Chemical makers were pleased that the House version of the bill was stripped of numeric targets for residual emissions by Representative John D. Dingell&#39;s committee on Tuesday.</p> <p>A number of manufacturers said that some of the major costs in the bill would remain unknown until state and local regulators acted.</p> <p>Companies that use solvents to process chemicals into more than 700,000 consumer products, from shampoos to antifreeze, had mixed feelings about provisions reducing allowable solvent emissions. The Senate bill ordered a study of the contribution of solvents to depletion of ozone in the atmosphere and a 1 percent reduction in emissions, which was considerably milder than originally proposed, said Ralph Engle, president of the Chemical Specialties Manufacturers Association. The solvents provisions would also affect dry cleaners.</p> <p>BARNABY J. FEDER</p> <p>The Steelmakers</p> <p>Rules Criticized As &#39;Arbitrary&#39;</p> <p>With the passage of the Senate bill, the nation&#39;s major steel producers remain unsuccessful in their fight against provisions that would effectively prohibit the further use of coke ovens, the furnaces that convert coal to coke in the making of steel.</p> <p>The steelmakers are disturbed by a requirement that they eliminate virtually all emissions from coke ovens by the year 2020 and in the meantime adopt the best available emissions-reduction technology by 1995.</p> <p>Steel industry officials said that meeting the 1995 deadline would cost the industry about $5 billion. They added that there is no technology yet available that would eliminate emissions completely and that the bill&#39;s deadline of 2020 would effectively close most of the nation&#39;s coke ovens and lead to the loss of thousands of jobs. They maintain that the standard in the Senate bill - the risk of cancer to one resident in 10,000 in a community near a coke oven - is arbitrary.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The steel industry is opposed to the use of arbitrary, calculated risk-based standards for shutting down coke plants,&#39;&#39; said Walter F. Williams, chairman of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.</p> <p>Philip X. Masciantonio, vice president of environmental affairs at the USX Corporation, which operates the nation&#39;s largest steel company, said the evidence of the extent of the health risk posed by coke ovens was far from conclusive. He said USX had spent more than $250 million in recent years to reduce emissions from its coke ovens.</p> <p>A number of steel companies in Europe and Japan are developing processes for the manufacture of steel that bypass making coke. But Milton Deaner, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, described as nonsense the opinion that in a few years the industry would have a steelmaking process that would do away with coke ovens.</p> <p>JONATHAN P.

295667>Utility Gets Two Sweetened Offers Two Connecticut utilities sweetened their offers yesterday for the Public Service Company of New Hampshire in filings with the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manchester, N.H.  <p>The bidding is taking two directions: a higher value for the company, to gain the approval of creditors and equity holders, and a lower proposed schedule of rate increases, to satisfy the State of New Hampshire, which is a party to the bankruptcy.</p> <p>But the new bids appear to divide the creditors and the equity holders of the bankrupt company. $2.29 Billion Bid The United Illuminating Company of New Haven said it had filed a plan worth $2.29 billion and would provide for five years of 5.5 percent annual increases, assuming that the Seabrook nuclear power plant, of which Public Service owns 35.6 percent, eventually operates.</p> <p>If the reactor never runs, the rate increases woud continue in the sixth and seventh years.</p> <p>Unsecured creditors favor the United Illuminating proposal because it would pay them interest for the period after the bankruptcy filing, in January 1988, and could result in the company emerging from bankruptcy before all regulatory approvals for the reorganization were in place.</p> <p>But shareholders of Public Service have endorsed a $2.25 billion offer by Northeast Utilities of Berlin, Conn. A $400 Million Improvement</p> <p>The Northeast bid involves seven years of 5.5 percent rate increases. The bid was a $400 million improvement over the utility&#39;s earlier offer, and eliminated some clauses that could have led to even higher rates.</p> <p>Northeast also said it would give warrants to Public Service shareholders that could be exercised only if Seabrook operated.</p> <p>William B. Ellis, Northeast&#39;s chairman, said the agreement of shareholders &#39;&#39;represents a significant breakthrough&#39;&#39; in resolving the bankruptcy.</p> <p>On the other hand, George W. Edwards Jr., the chairman of United Illuminating, said his new offer was &#39;&#39;the direct result of input gained in six weeks of nonstop negotiations and fact-finding with all of the players.&#39;&#39; The creditors, he said, have &#39;&#39;agreed in principle&#39;&#39; to support his company&#39;s bid. A Third Bid</p> <p>A third bidder, the New England Electric System of Westborough, Mass., also filed a revised bid, but did not change the amount it offered. Its plan was changed to give debt holders a stronger call on the proceeds, which would be $2 billion if Seabrook operated and $1.9 billion if it did not.</p> <p>The competitors have questioned various aspects of each other&#39;s bids, seeking to cast doubt on what rate increases each plan would actually produce, and the value that the market would attach to securities issued in a takeover. The bankruptcy, the first by an investor-owned utility since the Depression, has been complicated by the fact that the company&#39;s product, electricity, is sold under state price controls.</p> <p>Public Service, with 860,000 customers, is the largest utility in New Hampshire. It was driven into bankruptcy by its investment in the Seabrook plant, on the New Hampshire coast. Neighbors of the plant are seeking to block its opening because, they say, the area could never be safely evacuated in an emergency.</p> <p>United Illuminating owns the second-largest share of Seabrook, 17.5 percent. Northeast Utilities and New England Electric own smaller shares.</p>
399118>N.R.C. Modifies Stand On Closing Shoreham AS always with Shoreham, the legal decisions are slow and thick, but in a decision last month the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission appeared to be laying the groundwork for approving the decommissioning of the reactor. The Long Island Power Authority hopes that by the end of the year Lilco&#39;s operating license can be demoted to a &quot;possession only&quot; status, for the radioactive material, and transferred to the New York Power Authority, so detailed planning can begin for the decommissioning. But those who want to preserve the reactor are minimizing the importance of the most decision.  <p>The N.R.C., slicing a complicated issue thin, handed a victory to opponents of the plant by limiting the subject areas that an Environmental Impact Statement would have to cover before decommissioning could proceed. Opponents of the February 1989 settlement agreement, including the Department of Energy and the White House, had called for such a statement, which can take a year to prepare and can be subject to litigation afterward. Independence of Agency</p> <p>Last month the Council on Environmental Quality, a White House office that enforces Federal agencies&#39; compliance with environmental laws, sent a letter to the chairman of the N.R.C. saying that approving decommissioning would constitute a Federal action and that such actions have to be studied with such a statement. An impact statement would have to examine alternatives, the opponents said, including the alternative of running the plant.</p> <p>But the five commissioners, who are appointed by the President but run an independent agency, carved out a narrow role for themselves.</p> <p>&quot;Lilco is legally entitled under the Atomic Energy Act and our regulations to make, without any N.R.C. approval, an irrevocable decision not to operate Shoreham,&quot; said the decision. Running the plant as a reactor or converting it to another fuel &quot;are alternatives to the decision not to operate Shoreham and thus are beyond commission consideration,&quot; the five members added.</p> <p>The decision noted that the case of the Shoreham case has taken the Commission into new ground, because approving a decision not to run a plant was not envisioned in the Atomic Energy Act.</p> <p>What the commission would review, the decision said, was the method for decommissioning, not the underlying decision whether to run the plant. That alternative was beyond what anyone was required to consider in an environmental-impact statement, because running the plant would require a change in Government policy, the decision said.</p> <p>At Scientists and Engineers for Secure Energy in Manhattan, a group that is suing to keep Shoreham alive, the executive director, Miro M. Todorovich, said he had found irony in the narrow approach of the N.R.C. When the Long Island Lighting Company was struggling to obtain an operating license for Shoreham, he said, the commission construed all issues broadly, slowing the process. Now, he said, it takes them bit by bit, without confronting the larger wisdom. &#39;The Watershed Decision&#39;</p> <p>Supporters of decommissioning see the new decision as a sign that Washington is beginning to step out of the way of decisions on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station, and they said they saw a conclusion on the horizon.</p> <p>&quot;We believe that was the watershed decision,&quot; said Thomas A. Twomey Jr., a member of the Long Island Power Authority and chairman of its decommissioning committee. &quot;We are very confident the license-transfer approval will be issued by N.R.C.&quot;</p> <p>The commission might require the Long Island and New York Power Authorities to produce an Environmental Impact Statement on the method of decommissioning, he said. But he added, &quot;We think that&#39;s unlikely.&quot;</p> <p>On Wednesday the lawyer for two groups seeking to preserve the plant filed an appeal of the commission decision and tried to minimize it. Anticipating Results of Study</p> <p>James P. McGranery Jr., representing the Shoreham-Wading River School District and Scientists and Engineers for Secure Energy, said an Environmental Impact Statement could be very revealing, even if it did not consider operating the reactor.</p> <p>&quot;It would be able to set out all the costs, environmental and economic, of replacing Shoreham with the settlement agreement&#39;s proposed oil and gas plants, in contrast to the use of Shoreham,&quot; he said, adding that the decision had &quot;nothing that would prevent us from putting all the relevant info before the public, so they can see what an atrocious proposal this is.&quot;</p> <p>The appeal he filed argued, among other points, that the decision was &quot;an abdication of the N.R.C.&#39;s obligation to assure that its licensing decisions are consistent with protection of the environment.&quot;</p> <p>The roles in the battle over the plant, which began 23 years ago, are now reversed. Opponents of the plant had used the skills of bureaucratic delay.</p> <p>Now, according to Mr. Twomey, delay costs $8 million a month, mostly in labor costs, to preserve a reactor that will never run. The fuel is in the spent-fuel pool, and the reactor has been drained of water.</p> <p>The Long Island Power Authority would like to put the fuel in dry casks, a method requiring less maintenance and fewer mechanical systems to assure safety and and leading to sharply lower costs. The hope is to sell the fuel to another utility, although there has been no market for slightly used fuel. Specter of Iraqi War</p> <p>Those who want to preserve the plant muse that if the standoff with Iraq turns to war, Shoreham may win another chance.</p> <p>&quot;If those wells in Kuwait become burning holes, we are ready to go to the President of the United States and ask that he simply declare that he has the power to put the plant into operation,&quot; said Dr. Todorovich.</p> <p>Although many of the workers who would operate the plant have left, replacements could be found at other reactor sites, he said. &quot;If it were the time of F.D.R. or Harry Truman, I know they would would quickly find the skillful operators in other places,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Shoreham would save nearly 40,000 barrels of oil for each day it ran.</p> <p>But Mr. Twomey said: &quot;We think it&#39;s a remote scenario. It raises all sorts of constitutional issues that would be litigated for years and years and years.&quot;  Problems With Full Operation</p> <p>Mr. McGranery said he was hoping that Shoreham would be given a stay of execution, in the form of a decision to do nothing. &quot;Maybe in this case it would be appropriate to consider a mothballing, which would make the reactor available in case of future need,&quot; he said. Future events, he said, &quot;might cause people to reconsider.&quot;</p> <p>Others are also anxious to preserve the option to use the reactor to generate power. As recently as last month, the Energy Secretary, James Watkins, whose desk in Washington is marked with a bumper sticker reading, &quot;Another Environmentalist for Nuclear Power,&quot; expressed hope that Shoreham would run.</p> <p>But what little experience the civilian nuclear industry has with mothballed reactors is mostly bad. When the Three Mile Island 1 plant was shut for six years after the accident that destroyed Three Mile Island 2 in March 1979, technicians found extensive corrosion.</p> <p>Another major problem is the workers&#39; skills. Developing the teams of operators and technicians to run a plant usually takes years and begins long before construction is finished.</p> <p>In addition, Three Mile Island 1 was under surveillance and maintenance for the shutdown, as is required under the operating license. At Shoreham, the Long Island Power Authority wants to end the expense of guarding, testing and staffing the plant, arguing that the money could be put into conservation or other activities.</p> <p>If the license is transferred to the authority, even without the dismantling taking place. The authority is barred by law from operating a nuclear plant.</p>
617274>No title After years of planning to rebuild the Times Square subway stop as part of a massive redevelopment project in the area, the Transit Authority has instead decided that it should not wait any longer to begin fixing the station itself. The authority yesterday unveiled a design for a $130 million reconstruction of the station, which is the city&#39;s busiest, with 470,000 passengers using it daily.  <p>The plan calls for new walls, flooring and lighting throughout the station. Some of the smaller passageways would be eliminated and others would be made larger, and some ramps would be removed to give the station a more open feel. Retail space would be added, along with elevators and other changes that would allow for wheelchair access.</p> <p>No tracks would be moved, but all public areas would be made over. This is in contrast to the recent renovation of the Grand Central Terminal subway stop, where the mezzanine level, which is the level below the street and above the tracks, was modernized but the platform level was left untouched. No More &#39;Half Stations&#39;</p> <p>&quot;We&#39;re not going to do any more half stations,&quot; said Jerome Forman, the senior vice president for capital program management for the Transit Authority.</p> <p>On Friday a subcommittee of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the Transit Authority, approved the spending of $12.3 million on the redesign. The money would come from $75 million that the M.T.A. had set aside as its share of a joint project, with Park Tower Realty, to rebuild the station. But those plans called for Park Tower to build four large office towers at Broadway and 42d Street, and were deferred with the decline of the city&#39;s real estate market.</p> <p>The joint proposal was more ambitious in some ways: it called for a great rotunda on the mezzanine level, which would have meant raising Seventh Avenue by a foot. But the Transit Authority&#39;s own plan is more thorough, covering the platform areas as well as the mezzanine.</p> <p>The full M.T.A. must still authorize the spending of the $12.3 million on the Transit Authority&#39;s proposal. In the absence of a private partner, it is unclear where the rest of the money will come from.</p> <p>The Transit Authority&#39;s design calls for building a main entrance -- something the station now lacks -- on the south side of 42d Street on the small block between Broadway and Seventh Avenue. The station now has 21 entrances, and some would be closed permanently to reduce crime.</p> <p>The plan would also reconfigure the shuttle trains so they could stop at staggered positions. As a result, riders would not have to walk around the end of one track to reach a train on another.</p> <p>Ramps leading to the BMT tracks would be removed and replaced with stairs to make the platforms more open. And the passageway over the Seventh Avenue IRT tracks, which is sometimes jammed with 7,000 people per hour, would be widened.</p> <p>Mr. Forman said one intention was to increase the amount of retail space, because shops attract people and increase safety. But he said it might be hard for the current tenants to survive during construction, which he said would take five or six years.</p>
1304399>Some Conflicts Arise at Hearing On Ford Replacement-Tire Issue A government agency briefed members of a House committee this afternoon on the safety of the tires that the Ford Motor Company is using to replace those made by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. after the committee chairman said the automaker might be using tires with even higher failure rates than the Firestones. On Tuesday, the chairman, Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, said that seven of the tire models that Ford was using to replace 13 million Firestone tires on its Explorer sport utility vehicles might have higher failure rates than those they were replacing. A spokesman for the Republican majority on the committee, Ken Johnson, raised that number to 11 today but said that the higher rates did not necessarily mean that the tires were unsafe.  <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration provided a briefing on the matter to the committee today but did not say anything publicly.</p> <p>After the briefing, the ranking Democrat on the committee, John Dingell of Michigan, said that the highway agency &#39;&#39;could not and would not now say that any tires on Chairman Tauzin&#39;s list, including the Ford replacement tires, were bad.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But Mr. Tauzin, in a statement issued a few minutes later, said that the agency &#39;&#39;could not and would not say that any of the replacement tires in question were safe.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Ford said it had no new information from the agency and was proceeding with its replacement program.</p> <p>Before the hearing on Tuesday, held by two subcommittees of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Tauzin had said that some of the replacement tires had a higher failure rate. The analysis was done by the committee&#39;s Republican staff. Today he said that the highway agency needed more time to analyze the data and that he was asking Ford to test the replacement tires the same way it had tested the Firestone tires.</p> <p>The highway safety agency faces a variety of problems in determining the reliablity of the data on the rate of claims for tread separation. One is that the tire companies use different definitions for the claims.</p> <p>At Ford, Ken Zino, a spokesman, said, &#39;&#39;Nobody&#39;s more concerned about the safety of our customers than the Ford Motor Company; as soon as we understand the data, which we haven&#39;t seen, we will react.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Tauzin said he was sending Ford the data today.</p>
506430>Judge Sets Up New Hurdles for U.S. Plutonium Dump A Federal District judge in Washington has erected two major impediments to the Department of Energy&#39;s plan to open a repository for plutonium bomb wastes in New Mexico, ruling that the dump requires the approval of Congress and the State of New Mexico. The department has been trying for years to get both Congress and New Mexico to approve the project, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, near Carlsbad, N.M. A major issue has been New Mexico&#39;s request for money to improve the roads over which waste-laden trucks would travel to the plant, as well as training for hospital and emergency crews in radiation safety, and oversight by the the Environmental Protection Agency. Estimates of these costs have run as high as $600 million.  <p>The judge, John Garrett Penn, in a ruling filed on Jan. 31 and made public yesterday, issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the Energy Department from opening the repository, on which $1 billion has been spent since 1983. The Department of Energy maintains that the repository, known as Wipp, is safe and ready to open for testing, apart from bureaucratic obstacles like the approval from other government agencies. The Energy Secretary, James D. Watkins, has made opening the repository a top goal. Temporary Injunction</p> <p>Judge Penn had issued a temporary injunction on Nov. 26, while he considered the question of who could legally approve transfer of the site, 26 miles east of Carlsbad, from general public use to the custody of the Department of Energy. The department has said for years that it would prefer Congressional action, but if that could not be obtained, the land could be transferred by an administrative action of the Department of the Interior.</p> <p>But Judge Penn ruled that Congress must act before the Energy Department could begin putting wastes into the storage rooms and corridors dug into a salt formation 2,150 feet below the desert. In his opinion granting the temporary injunction, Judge Penn said that the Interior Department could not issue the transfer if it was permanent, and that the waste storage appeared to be permanent. The Energy Department had argued that the initial storage, of 4,000 to 8,000 barrels of waste, was reversible if it failed to prevent leakage, and therefore was not permanent.</p> <p>In the November order Judge Penn said, &quot;Defendants have presented no convincing evidence that the hazardous waste materials they seek to introduce in the Wipp site can be retrieved.&quot;  Must Deal With Congress</p> <p>The Interior Department gave the Energy Department the land about a decade ago, but specified at that time that it was not granting permission for the wastes to be stored.</p> <p>In his new decision, Judge Penn added another hurdle: that under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the nation&#39;s basic toxic waste management law, the Department of Energy would also need a permit from New Mexico.</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s the largest legal victory in the battle over Wipp,&quot; said Dan W. Reicher, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which led one of the suits against the plant. &quot;What it essentially says is that the Department of Energy has got to deal with Congress and the New Mexico regulators if it has any hope of ever opening this facility.&quot;</p> <p>Fred Lash, a spokesman for the department, said the Government would appeal the decision. He added, &quot;We have felt that we&#39;ve complied with the regulations&quot; on obtaining a state permit.  Volumes of Applications</p> <p>Lindsay A. Lovejoy, an Assistant Attorney General in New Mexico, said last night in a telephone interview that it would be a &quot;matter of some months&quot; before the New Mexico Environment Department could process the application, including analyzing it and holding public hearings.</p> <p>&quot;When this thing came in it was five volumes, and a permit will be of a similar size, with a detailed set of operating rules,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The Federal Environmental Protection Agency is preparing rules on radioactive waste disposal, and New Mexico wants the Energy Department to wait at least until those rules are issued before putting waste in place, if not actually delaying long enough to see if the site complies with the new rules.</p> <p>He added, however, &quot;I think everybody has said that if the terms and conditions are appropriate, the project can go forward.&quot;</p> <p>Among the terms and conditions, said Mr. Lovejoy, were preparations for 25,000 truckloads of waste.</p> <p>Adam Babich, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, which led another one of the suits against the Energy Department, said the department&#39;s attempt to run the plant without a permit from the state &quot;was unworthy of the department&#39;s important mission of finding a safe, long-term solution to the problem of radioactive waste disposal.&quot; But he said he did not oppose opening the repository under the right circumstances.  Environmentalists&#39; Attitude</p> <p>The Natural Resources Defense Council also does not oppose opening the repository. &quot;We have never categorically said that no waste should go into Wipp,&quot; Mr. Reicher said. &quot;Our position has been that DOE needs to get proper Congressional authority, and comply with all the laws and regulations, before any waste goes into the facility. If that happens, it is the department&#39;s right to load waste.&quot;</p> <p>The environmentalists&#39; attitude toward the site differs fundamentally from the way they look at many other Department of Energy projects because the dump does not produce any waste, but only handles it. Much of the waste the department would accept is presently stored in ways that are unsafe for the long term and, in some cases, perhaps even the short term. The dump is meant to handle transuranic wastes, or man-made elements that remain radioactive for thousands of years.</p> <p>The department may be somewhat less rushed in storing the waste, because its bomb production complex has stopped almost entirely. Two years ago the department said it would have to open the waste site to avoid shutting its plutonium assembly plant, at Rocky Flats, near Denver, but last month it said that plant had no more work to do because of recent agreements with Russia and unilateral decisions by President Bush.</p>
251774>When Methanol Is in the Tank Experimental vehicles that burn methanol instead of gasoline or diesel fuel as a way of reducing automobile air pollution are turning up around the country with increasing frequency. But engineers are finding that the alternative fuel potentially creates as many problems as it solves.  <p>Methanol has important advantages: very high octane, low production of particulate pollution, and a chemical composition that permits it to be made from coal. And cars to use it can be produced with relatively small changes in gasoline engine technology.</p> <p>But tests also disclose that as it burns, methanol produces formaldehyde and has a tendency to eat through fuel tanks, fuel pumps, and other auto parts not made of stainless steel. Should methanol catch on, the nation would probably have to depend on foreign sources for it, unless the price of oil and natural gas rose high enough to permit the competitive conversion of coal to methanol.</p> <p>Listing the pollution problems, Eric A. Goldstein, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said, &#39;&#39;It sounds almost dooming.&#39;&#39; His group helped bring a group of experimental methanol buses to New York as part of the settlement of a lawsuit with the General Motors Corporation concerning emission controls on gasoline automobiles. &#39;&#39;But it would be premature to conclude that the methanol concept won&#39;t work,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>He said additional research was needed on catalytic converters. Those now in use were designed to control pollution from burning gasoline, not methanol.</p> <p>Many of the experimental methanol vehicles are the result of General Motors&#39; enthusiasm for the idea.</p> <p>For example, G.M. supplied Chevy Corsicas to 15 universities for conversion to methanol so that they could compete in an 1,100-mile marathon from Detroit through Toronto and New York to Washington earlier this month. Conversion problems and fuel economy were the focus of the race.</p> <p>In addition, The Triboro Coach Corporation is running six methanol-powered buses supplied by General Motors on New York City routes. And G.M. has just shipped the first dozen of 2,200 methanol cars to the state government in California.</p> <p>The chairman of G.M., Roger B. Smith, believes that the use of alternatives to gasoline and diesel fuel is likely in the next few years because of concern about pollution and energy imports. &#39;&#39;Our role is to learn to use all kinds of fuels, and see what the energy companies want to do,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Smith when the Corsica marathon stopped in New York.</p> <p>The marathon, in which teams of engineering students from the universities not only converted the cars but also made a variety of other improvements, showed engineers some new ideas for using methanol. But it also underlined continuing problems.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The emissions problem on methanol is not better or worse, just different,&#39;&#39; said Donald L. Runkle, a G.M. vice president in charge of the advanced engineering staff. The formaldehyde emissions react with sunlight to make smog, he said, and the manufacture of methanol as a fuel makes carbon dioxide, a gas believed to contribute to global warming.</p> <p>But it has been found that the buses being tested by Triboro Coach in New York emit lower levels of particulates and nitrogen oxides than diesel buses do, but a higher level of hydrocarbons, formaldehyde and carbon monoxide.</p> <p>Methanol&#39;s backers say it can be made to burn more cleanly if the engines are specifically designed for methanol.</p> <p>At the Environmental Protection Agency, Charles L. Gray, director of the emission control technology division, said methanol could burn more cleanly if mixed with large amounts of air. Gasoline engines cannot run with such a rich air mixture, so engines converted to methanol do not allow optimum combustion conditions.</p> <p>But even in a converted engine, methanol produces less hydrocarbon and oxides of nitrogen than gasoline does. Methanol, or methyl alcohol, is closely related to methane, or natural gas, and to ethyl alcohol, which can be used for fuel or for cocktails.</p> <p>Another problem in Southern California and many other urban areas is fumes from unburned gasoline that react with sunlight to form ozone. A major advantage for methanol, Mr. Gray said, is that if it evaporates before it burns it does not readily join such reactions. He predicted that methanol cars could bring an ozone reduction of 25 to 40 percent for most cities.</p> <p>But conversion is complicated. About 200 students from the 15 universities received kits from General Motors to make essential modifications, like replacing the carbon-steel gas tanks with stainless steel.</p> <p>The students also used imagination. Methanol, like gasoline, is burned as a vapor, but unlike gasoline, does not go from the liquid to the vapor state easily, especially in cold weather. The Rochester Institute of Technology team borrowed parts from an ultrasonic humidifier to help that process. At the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, students put their Corsica in a giant refrigerator to test for cold-weather problems.</p> <p>Chasing $20,000 in prizes, many teams souped up 2.8-liter engines to run at compression ratios more typical of race cars to take advantage of methanol&#39;s high octane of 110.</p> <p>With a more powerful engine that resulted from the increased octane, some students found they could take apart the transmission and modify it so the engine could run efficiently at lower speeds. Others tried ceramic parts to retain heat in the engine for higher efficiency. Molybdenum coatings on internal engine parts were used to cut friction between internal moving parts.</p> <p>The Florida Tech team modified the six-cylinder engine so that at highway speeds three cylinders shut down, saving fuel. General Motors tried that approach a few years ago on gasoline cars, but could not make it work.</p> <p>Methanol also poses some safety problems. It is poisonous but odorless, making leaks hard to detect, and burns with invisible flames. So for the marathon, it was mixed in an 85-15 blend of methanol and unleaded gasoline. Other components were added to give extra smell and color.</p> <p>Another problem is methanol&#39;s lower energy density - the amount of energy per unit volume. A gallon of methanol has only a little more than half the energy of gasoline - 65,000 B.T.U.&#39;s, compared with 116,000 B.T.U.&#39;s. The cars require more frequent refueling or larger fuel tanks. Engineers would like to build a composite tank to make better use of the space in nooks and crannies under the car, but they have not yet developed a material that methanol cannot dissolve.</p> <p>The greatest long-term advantage of methanol is that it can be made from coal, which is more easily found in this country than crude oil.</p> <p>At present, most methanol is made from natural gas because the cost of manufacture is far less than making it from coal. Coal-derived methanol would not be competitive with gasoline or diesel fuel until the price of a barrel of oil rose to $30 or $40 from the current $20.</p> <p>While oil prices are low, methanol will be made from natural gas. But natural gas in this country is almost as expensive as oil. If methanol were to be developed as a fuel, the natural gas would probably come from the Middle East, where prices are much lower. But this would make the methanol supply, like much of the present gasoline supply, dependent on foreign sources.</p> <p>BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
1851732>Efficiency, Not Just Alternatives, Is Promoted as an Energy Saver Green Mountain Coffee Roasters makes a lot of money selling individual servings of ground coffee in white cups that are churned out by the millions from a hissing, clanking production line here. But it recently found a way to generate even greater profits from the operation that will require only a modest investment. Spending $150 to $200 to install a more efficient blower to cool the laser that carves the date and batch number into each passing cup will cut Green Mountain&#39;s annual electricity bill for each laser by about $200, says Paul Comey, its vice president for environmental affairs. That might not seem like much, except that the company has 40 such lasers, which it plans to upgrade this week.  <p>Green Mountain Coffee was persuaded to undertake such improvements in efficiency through an unusual effort by the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation, which is under contract with the state to find thousands of such energy savings.</p> <p>Opportunities like this abound in the commercial and industrial sectors, requiring no new research or technology. But few places are doing an effective job of finding them, experts say.</p> <p>Vermont is one that is. Similarly, New York committed itself to pushing its utilities to do the same when Gov. Eliot Spitzer said recently that his goal was to cut electricity demand by 15 percent from what it would otherwise have been in 2015. That implies holding demand almost steady.</p> <p>Renewable energy sources like wind and solar are getting a lot of attention these days as a way to reduce the impact of energy use on the environment. But even enthusiastic supporters of alternative energy agree that the easiest way to cut carbon emissions and air pollution is to focus more on efficiency, less on pollution-free generation.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Efficiency is the steak,&#39;&#39; said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club. &#39;&#39;Renewables are the sizzle.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>At a recent conference on energy efficiency and investment strategy, Pedro Haas, an energy expert at McKinsey &amp; Company, said his consulting firm recently asked people worldwide what payback time they would find acceptable before investing money to save energy.</p> <p>One fourth of them said they would never spend any money to improve energy efficiency; 50 percent said they wanted to earn back the investment in two years or less.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;That means about 75 percent of the public will require economics that are just not there,&#39;&#39; Mr. Haas said.</p> <p>The alternative is to let utilities make the investment. James E. Rogers, the chief executive of Duke Energy, said he would like to persuade regulators to let his company invest in energy efficiency on customers&#39; premises, and receive a profit on those investments.</p> <p>For example, if buying an extra-efficient air-conditioner costs an additional $1,000, a homeowner might hesitate, he said, but the utility would not. Duke would offer to pay for the device and collect a monthly fee as a return on the investment over time by adding a small charge to the electric bill.</p> <p>It would also collect an additional amount from other ratepayers, but they would end up saving money over the longer run because the investments help hold down demand, lessening the need to build expensive new power plants, the thinking goes.</p> <p>Ralph Cavanagh, an electricity expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that utility returns average 15 percent, and that the willingness of the utilities to invest in relatively low-return generation projects while customers ignore high-return efficiency investments was driving consumption 20 percent to 40 percent higher than it should be.</p> <p>Mr. Rogers and other utility executives sometimes talk about &#39;&#39;decoupling&#39;&#39; electricity rates, to encourage utilities to help their customers save money. At present, most regulated utilities have their rates set by state officials by calculating how much money they would need for a fair rate of return, and dividing by the amount of electricity sold, to arrive at a price for each kilowatt-hour, or for a kilowatt of load. Spend dollars to make more power, and earn a return on that money; spend dollars to sell less, and watch your income fall.</p> <p>The idea of decoupling peaked in the 1980s but after competition was introduced in the generating system, the idea lost favor. &#39;&#39;We had those discussions 20 years ago, and we need to have them again,&#39;&#39; said Diane Munns, the former chief utility regulator in Iowa, who now runs the retail energy services group at the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of the investor-owned utilities.</p> <p>But not everyone agrees. Money for such programs always comes from all electricity customers. In several states, industrial customers have argued that they should not be forced to subsidize investments in other factories that lower their competitors&#39; costs.</p> <p>In Vermont, a different argument has carried the day. Cutting electric consumption at Green Mountain&#39;s coffee roasting plant and hundreds of other places will eliminate the need to build some additional power plants, string transmission lines and fuel the plants.</p> <p>The last few megawatts of power, from new generators and lines, is more expensive than the cost from existing plants and lines, so cutting growth in electricity demand also cuts high-cost supplies.</p> <p>Nancy C. Floyd, co-founder and managing director of Nth Power, an investment banking firm that specializes in energy, said utilities may be best situated to promote efficiency because they already have a relationship with every building owner.</p> <p>California has long enlisted utilities to help cut electricity use, partly by structuring rates so a customer&#39;s last few kilowatt-hours are extremely expensive, raising the incentive to buy more efficient equipment. The state was a pioneer in giving utilities rate increases for spending money to improve the efficiency with which customers use electricity. California has another enforcer, the threat of repetition of recent blackouts.</p> <p>Decoupling is not limited to electricity; Utah just began an experiment in decoupling natural gas rates.</p> <p>Vermont took a different tack, hiring Vermont Energy Investment, doing business as Efficiency Vermont and describing itself as an &#39;&#39;efficiency utility.&#39;&#39; Some Vermont utilities were just too small to have effective efficiency programs, regulators said, and some did not have their hearts in the work.</p> <p>But no matter what the attitude of the utility, in most places the traditional ways of making energy still turn out to be easier to do than to save it. William R. Prindle, the deputy director of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a nonprofit group in Washington, said that it was simpler to finance and build a new power plant than to find the thousands of places to invest in energy efficiency, even if the dollars buy more power through efficiency than through new generation.</p> <p>But the incentives for energy efficiency are growing, experts say.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;When we started talking about this in 1990s in terms of energy efficiency versus coal energy, we were talking 4 cents a kilowatt-hour for coal, and 4 cents for energy efficiency,&#39;&#39; said R. Neal Elliott, the industrial program director at the council. &#39;&#39;Today we&#39;re talking optimistically, without carbon taxes, 10 cents for coal. With carbon taxes, we may be talking 20 cents for coal.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;And energy efficiency,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;is still 4 cents or less.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Energy Challenge</p>
1353381>New Suit Filed Against U.S. About Nuclear Waste Dump The State of Nevada filed suit today in its continuing effort to prevent the federal government from establishing a nuclear waste burial site at Yucca Mountain, about 90 miles from Las Vegas. The suit argues that under a new rule the Energy Department plans to disregard the site&#39;s geology and make its decision based on the metal canisters that would hold the waste.  <p>In evaluating the Yucca Mountain site, the department has found that water, which could spread the radioactive materials, moves faster through the mountain than previously believed. But the department also says it has gained confidence in the ability of &#39;&#39;engineered features&#39;&#39; like containers to hold the waste, as opposed to natural geology.</p> <p>In the suit filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Nevada, which has fought against the choice of Yucca Mountain since Congress named it the primary site in 1987, argued that federal law required the choice be based on its geology.</p> <p>Once the focus shifts to man-made packaging to isolate the waste, the suit contends, the suit contended, the Energy Department could approve permanent storage &#39;&#39;at virtually any physical site in the United States.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A lawyer for the state, Joseph R. Egan, suggested the basement of the Energy Department headquarters in Washington as a potential site.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Congress wanted the assurance of geologic isolation for the simple reason that we&#39;re fallible as human beings,&#39;&#39; Mr. Egan said. &#39;&#39;We can&#39;t have any assurance that what we design is going to be perfect.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In tests carried out by Nevada on the alloy that the Energy Department plans to use for waste canisters, he said, some combinations of water and heat created corrosion through the metal in less than a year.</p> <p>In a letter to Nevada officials, the Energy Department said that a National Academy of Sciences study called for evaluating the natural features of Yucca Mountain and the &#39;&#39;engineered,&#39;&#39; or man-made parts, together as a system and that the 1992 Energy Policy Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to focus on the whole system.</p> <p>Under a complicated scheme, the E.P.A. has issued standards that a repository would have to meet. The Energy Department is supposed to apply for a license to open the site from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the agency that regulates reactors; the regulatory commission is supposed to use the E.P.A. rules to make the decision on a license.</p> <p>The new Energy Department rule was published in the Federal Register on Nov. 14 and took effect a month later. The energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, could recommend Yucca Mountain&#39;s use to President Bush in the next few months, in which case the showdown would move to Congress. The suit, though, provides another avenue for Nevada to try to block the dump.</p> <p>Nevada is already suing over an environmental agency rule that to win a license, the repository must be capable of retaining the wastes for 10,000 years. The Energy Department believes that peak releases would come after that period; Nevada wants the period extended to 100,000 years or more.</p> <p>The department was supposed to start accepting waste from 125 nuclear plants in January 1998, but Yucca Mountain will not be ready for at least a decade.</p> <p>The project has suffered two recent setbacks. This month, the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, said the Energy Department was not ready to make a decision, because many technical studies were unfinished. Secretary Abraham disagreed, saying the report had been &#39;&#39;assembled to support a predetermined conclusion.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>And the law firm helping to prepare an application for the dump&#39;s license, Winston &amp; Strawn, withdrew because of a conflict of interest. The firm had been simulatenously lobbying for the nuclear industry.</p> <p>But Joseph Davis, a spokesman for the department, said the firm&#39;s withdrawal would not cause any delay, because the license application was still in the future.</p> <p>If the Energy Department recommends the site to Mr. Bush, Congress could step in to block it. A majority picked Yucca Mountain in 1987 as the prime site for investigation, but Nevada&#39;s senior senator, Harry Reid, is now the deputy majority leader and might be able to block the choice.</p> <p>Pressure is building from the utilities for the Energy Department to make good on its contract to take the wastes. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have focused interest on the safety of the old fuel stored at reactors, which is highly radioactive and outside the containment buildings.</p>
836344>Safety Deadline Set By Nuclear Agency For 2 Power Plants The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has given New England&#39;s largest utility 30  days to show that two of the nuclear power plants it operates in Connecticut are properly equipped for emergencies or face having to shut them down. The commission said it feared there might be problems with the emergency safety systems at the Millstone 3 plant, on Long Island Sound near New London, and at the Connecticut Yankee plant in Haddam Neck.  <p>The company, Northeast Utilities, is already under fire for violating safety rules at another of its three reactors at the Millstone site, Millstone 1, and today the commission said that Millstone 2&#39;s emergency system did not comply with its license and that the reactor must remain shut while it was analyzed. Millstone 1 has been shut under a similar order since last month.</p> <p>The commission&#39;s announcement today is a stinging rebuke to one of the nation&#39;s largest and most successful nuclear operators. But it is also an embarrassment for the commission, whose resident inspectors at Millstone apparently never stepped in to stop procedures the commission now says were hazardous.</p> <p>The threat to shut down the two operating reactors is an unusually strong step by the commission, and comes only a week after a cover article in Time magazine reported that the commission had failed to enforce its own regulations  at the Millstone 1 plant and elsewhere.</p> <p>At a briefing today on the commission&#39;s actions, Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson, the commission chairwoman, referred to the Time article, saying the agency should regard it &quot;as a form of constructive criticism and move forward.&quot;</p> <p>Earlier this year, the company acknowledged that Millstone 1 technicians, from the plant&#39;s opening in 1970, routinely removed all the fuel rods when they  refueled the reactor; they were supposed to remove only a third of them. The rods were then stored in a pool that could have overheated if cooling equipment  had failed. Eventually, the water could have boiled away, causing a meltdown, possibly worse than the one at the Three Mile Island plant in Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979.</p> <p>Commission officials also said today that workers at the plant often did not  wait long enough for the fuel rods to cool before moving them into the spent fuel pool.</p> <p>But today, William T. Russell, director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, said that the problems with the safety systems in Millstone 2 &quot;are more safety significant than the fuel pool issues&quot; in Millstone 1. He offered three examples: the filters used to keep debris from clogging the emergency cooling system are the wrong size; a system for sampling air in the reactor building during an emergency has pumps that may be too small, and a pump for supplying cooling water to some equipment in the plant cannot be protected against flooding.</p> <p>He also said that the agency&#39;s Inspector General was investigating &quot;potential wrongdoing&quot; by the company in not properly reporting the problems.</p> <p>In 1993, the agency found the company guilty of harassing an engineer who pointed out significant safety problems. Other former plant workers say they lost their jobs at Northeast Utilities for pointing out problems.</p> <p>The newly discovered problems in the safety systems at Millstone 2 also cast  doubt on Millstone 3 and Connecticut Yankee.</p> <p>Mr. Russell said that he sent the utility a letter on Thursday ordering it to demonstrate within 30 days that its equipment and procedures conformed to the commission&#39;s rules and the safety analyses that were the basis for licensing the plants in the first place.</p> <p>Keeping Millstone 1 shut costs $5 million to $6 million a month, mostly for replacement power; at Millstone 2 the cost is $8 million to $10 million. Connecticut utility regulators are studying whether the company or its customers should pay the added costs. In 1994, the latest year for which figures were available, nearly three-quarters of the electricity generated in Connecticut was from nuclear power, one of the highest proportions in the United States.</p> <p>Many of the commission&#39;s findings came from the utility&#39;s own internal audit, dated last month, which it gave regulators. Ted Feigenbaum, a vice president of  Northeast Utilities, who took over as the company&#39;s chief nuclear officer on Feb. 1, said that as a result, the commission&#39;s order was not a surprise. Mr. Feigenbaum said that none of the safety problems was serious but added that  together they undermined the commission&#39;s confidence in plant safety. Mr. Feigenbaum said the commission had been &quot;under a lot of pressure to act.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Feigenbaum said the operations at Millstone were not always in accordance with procedures outlined in its licensing documents, but he said that reflected  the need to update the documents and was not a safety problem. Some hardware at  the plants was not to specification, but the differences were far too small to cause problems, he said.</p> <p>For example, the emergency core cooling system at Millstone 2 uses filters to keep out debris that could clog it as it circulates water through the plant. But the filters were not as fine as required by the plant&#39;s license.</p> <p>Engineers shut the plant on Feb. 19 to check the filters, after hearing reports of similar problems at the Diablo Canyon plant in California, Mr. Feigenbaum said. The shutdown was to last 35 days, but Mr. Feigenbaum said that  with the commission&#39;s new action, the shutdown could continue longer.</p> <p>Millstone 1 shut in early November, and the company hopes to have it open by  early July, but it will need the Commission&#39;s permission.</p> <p>Mr. Feigenbaum said that finding small discrepancies was &quot;not unexpected under the circumstances, when you&#39;re starting to turn over rocks.&quot; But Paul M. Blanch, an engineer formerly at Northeast&#39;s nuclear office headquarters in Berlin, Conn., said that a close review would find much more. He said that inspectors had found crucial water pipes supported by wooden blocks or by electrical conduits instead of steel supports he said were necessary. He and  other nuclear safety activists say that the Commission has been far too lax in enforcing its regulations.</p> <p>Mr. Blanch quit Northeast in 1993, after pressing top managers to fix what he said were several safety problems. He said he had been hounded out of his job, and the commission eventually agreed.</p> <p>Today the Commission said it was sending 18 to 20 inspectors to assure that the plants were operating as specified in their licenses. Mr. Blanch said in a telephone interview: &quot;I think it&#39;s a wonderful start. It&#39;s something we&#39;ve been  urging the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to do with all the plants throughout the country.&quot;</p>
374022>Secrecy Tied to Hanford Tanks&#39; Trouble Senior Energy Department officials said today that the department had failed to deal appropriately with radioactive waste tanks at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington State despite more than a year of strenuous efforts by the Energy Secretary, James D. Watkins, to replace a culture of secrecy that had allowed safety problems to fester.  <p>The department has shown a &#39;&#39;general lack of discipline and follow-up needed to resolve longstanding technical issues,&#39;&#39; Leo P. Duffy, the department&#39;s director of the Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management, testified today at a hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. Mr. Duffy was referring to how the department has handled studies by its contractors about hazards at the tanks, which hold millions of gallons of highly radioactive waste at Hanford. Some tanks are producing explosive gases, raising the possibility of a large release of radiation.</p> <p>With much of the weapons production complex shut because of mechanical or management breakdowns, many experts classify the tanks as the largest risk in the department&#39;s chain of 17 nuclear weapons plants in 12 states.</p> <p>A special inspection team sent to Hanford has found that despite efforts to counter decades of pollution, operations there are still contaminating 20 acres a year more land than is being cleaned up. The team&#39;s report, which has not been made public, also faulted maintenance of equipment at the tank farm, where 64 million gallons of highly radioactive waste left over from bomb fuel production has been stored up to 40 years in a method that was intended as an emergency measure.</p> <p>Awareness of Problem</p> <p>At the hearing today, Stephen M. Blush, director of the department&#39;s Office of Nuclear Safety, said contractors had known for 13 years that flammable gas was being generated in one tank, but that &#39;&#39;before March 1990 that information was not elevated to proper levels of management nor to D.O.E., and the heightened potential for a combustion event - a burn or an explosion - in the Hanford waste tanks went unresolved.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A report by his office made public today goes further, saying that &#39;&#39;ongoing problems indicate a failure to identify root causes and develop appropriate solutions and represent a systematic failure&#39;&#39; by both the contractor and the Government.</p> <p>The 560-square-mile site is now operated for the Department of Energy by a subsidiary of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. It was previously run by Rockwell International and before that by General Electric.</p> <p>At the Westinghouse Hanford Company, a subsidiary of the Pittsburgh-based company, Ronald J. Bliss, the vice president of waste management and environmental restoration, said Westinghouse had withheld nothing. He asserted it was Westinghouse engineers, using data gathered by others over the years, who first raised the possibility of a hazard that is now a major focus of interest: an explosion of gases under the crust that covers the wastes.</p> <p>A report raising that possibility took about two weeks to work its way to his level, he said, adding that he immediately called it to the attention of the department.</p> <p>Release of Information</p> <p>In his report, Mr. Blush said that Westinghouse and an Energy Department office in Richland, Wash., where Hanford is situated, made public in March information on the possibility of the tanks&#39; rupturing only because they feared that the State of Washington would do so first.</p> <p>But environmentalists have been raising concerns about the tanks for far longer. The Natural Resources Defense Council filed suit twice, in 1973 and 1978, contending at one point that by not taking action to remove the waste from the tanks and to place it in a more stable form for long-term storage, &#39;&#39;the opportunity to retrieve them by safe known means&#39;&#39; was being lost. Now Government officials say that some of the radioactive material has become so hardened and baked into place that they do not know how to remove it.</p> <p>While top officials said today that the department had been too secretive as recently as March, the director of the Washington Department of Ecology, Christine O. Gregoire, testified that getting accurate information was still a problem. She said that she was told of the problem with the tanks by &#39;&#39;informants,&#39;&#39; and that her department still relied on secret communications from plant workers. When she asked the Department of Energy about an accident in 1965 that lifted a tank six feet off its foundation and sent a geyser of radioactive steam 50 feet high, she said she was told it was &#39;&#39;a burp.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Energy must punish those who obscure or ignore safety problems,&#39;&#39; she testified. &#39;&#39;Our public, and us, continue to ask, how many more surprises can we expect?&#39;&#39; Earlier in July, a panel of scientists assembled by the department confirmed that the chemical processing that created the wastes also released large amounts of radiation to surrounding areas.</p> <p>In an interview, Ms. Gregoire said Mr. Blush&#39;s report of &#39;&#39;systematic failure&#39;&#39; was an unprecedented admission of error by the Department of Energy, and she praised Mr. Watkins for allowing the department to admit its shortcomings. But Ms. Gregoire, speaking of the officials at Hanford, added, &#39;&#39;His philosophy is not down in the agency.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A similar comment was made in testimony by John F. Ahearne, the chairman of the department&#39;s Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety, who said he had told Mr. Watkins that the &#39;&#39;safety culture&#39;&#39; that he had been promoting was taking hold but was not fully in place.</p> <p>Dr. Ahearne today repeated to Senator John Glenn, an Ohio Democrat who heads the Governmental Affairs Committee, the assessment in a letter he sent to Mr. Watkins last week, that the tanks &#39;&#39;present a serious situation, if not an imminent hazard.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A major focus of the hearing was how to insure safety at the tanks. One tank releases large volumes of flammable gas every eight weeks or so, when the pressure pushes aside a crust that is two or three feet thick.</p>
754491>Blackout at L.I. Control Center Delays Takeoffs in the Northeast A power failure at an air traffic control center on Long Island blacked out the controllers&#39; radar screens for nine minutes early yesterday and disabled computers for hours. The failure did not cause any accidents but it delayed departures from airports around the Northeast for up to an hour. Christopher S. Boughn, the president of the chapter of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association at the center, in Ronkonkoma, said, &quot;We lost all the power except for the battery-operated lights.&quot; Because of the hour, about 3:30 A.M., there were only 28 airplanes under the center&#39;s control, he said. &quot;At that hour, it was all package haulers,&quot; he said.  <p>The center handles high-altitude traffic arriving, leaving or traveling through the New York area.</p> <p>The blackout occurred after technicians finished working on the main power supply. They had switched to a backup generator while they were working, but as they tried to switch the main power supply back on, some power-control equipment failed, according to Lisa Campbell, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration.</p> <p>The center&#39;s computers were not restarted until about 7:30 A.M. Mr. Boughn said that they were shut down during the period when they normally receive flight-plan information electronically, and so even when they restarted, they were not able to generate the information needed by controllers.</p> <p>Along with the radar screens, the controllers use &quot;flight strips,&quot; or strips of paper that show the airline and number of a flight, the kind of plane, its origin and destination and other data, all prepared by the computer. Controllers position the strip on a rack in a way that indicates who is responsible for it, and they make notations on the strip as they issue instructions to the pilots or receive information.</p> <p>With the computers down, the flight strips had to be prepared by hand. This and other problems related to the computers reduced the number of planes that the controllers could handle, Mr. Boughn said.</p> <p>According to the F.A.A., controllers manually entered data into the computer on 250 flights.</p> <p>The computer returned to full operation about 10:30 A.M., Mr. Boughn said. Ms. Campbell said that delays began to thin out by 8:30 A.M. The delays extended to Philadelphia and Washington.</p>
430654>Low Oil Prices Are Bad, Some U.S. Experts Say American oil experts are closely watching a fractious OPEC as it meets in its first session since the Persian Gulf war, with many hoping for the same things that some OPEC members want: a new agreement that will hold down production, so prices will stabilize or rise. Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other members abandoned all production restraints during the war to stop prices from getting out of control. Now that the war is over, they are arguing over who should cut back and by how much.  <p>Government officials have said at various times that the United States does not have a target oil price, and that this country favors prices in the range of $18 to $20 a barrel. Before the war in the gulf, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries set a target price of $21 a barrel, which would mean prices in this country of closer to $23, but OPEC was well shy of that price when the target was set, and exceeded it last year only because of the war. Paying for the War</p> <p>Theodore Eck, the chief economist of the Amoco Corporation, said: &quot;The signal has been, we understand that OPEC exporting countries have to pay for the war, the cleanup and all this kind of stuff, and they&#39;re going to need some money.&quot;</p> <p>In fact, regardless of any signaling by this country, many of the oil companies are hoping for a price in the OPEC target range to bolster domestic drilling. So are people in businesses linked economically to oil companies and to the economies of oil-producing regions in this country.</p> <p>But the organization, by its own calculation, is producing substantially more oil than the world demands, raising the prospect that prices will fall. While the Bush Administration has not publicly articulated the point, many analysts contend that this is bad for the United States.</p> <p>&quot;Prices may fall to the mid-teens, and this is a disaster for the United States,&quot; said Charles Ebinger, an energy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in Washington. &quot;What we&#39;re likely to see at those kind of prices is a further erosion of domestic oil-producing capacity, and rising imports, precisely from the region where we just saw this conflict,&quot; he said. &quot;We are setting ourselves up for a situation where in 5 to 10 years imports will be 60 to 70 percent of our consumption.&quot;  Encouragement to Consume</p> <p>Wilfrid L. Kohl, the director of the international energy program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said that the impact of a price decline on this country &quot;depends on where you sit,&quot; with consumers benefiting and producers suffering. But if the price stays down, he said, &quot;it encourages consumption again, which we certainly don&#39;t want to do.&quot; And with no agreement now, he said, it will be harder still when Kuwait and Iraq eventually repair the damage to their oil industries and resume exports.</p> <p>Not everyone agrees that a new OPEC accord is desirable for this country, or even of much importance. Philip K. Verleger Jr., a fellow at the Institute for International Economics, said stocks were too low and companies would not build inventories until the price of oil on the spot market was sharply lower than the price offered on the futures market for delivery one year hence. That price has lately been around $18.50, and re-stocking would occur if the price for immediate delivery hit $15.50, he said.</p> <p>Mr. Eck of Amoco said that to him, world demand and world supply seemed pretty much in balance. &quot;The end of the war was a non-event,&quot; he said, speaking of the effect on oil supplies. Spring usually brings a global decline in demand of about 2 million barrels a day, he said, but this year, maintenance work in the North Sea, which is outside OPEC&#39;s control, will push down production there.</p> <p>In previous years, he added, a spring price decline occurs because the Soviet Union increases exports in that season. But noting that country&#39;s economic decline, he added, &quot;this year, who knows?&quot;</p>
693996>L.I.R.R. Suggests Options In the Event of a Walkout MANAGEMENT and the union workers at the Long Island Rail Road are preparing for a strike this week, when a 60-day &quot;cooling off&quot; period under the Railway Labor Act expires. Barring last-minute breakthroughs at the negotiating table or Congressional action, both sides are expecting the strike to begin at 12:01 A.M. on Thursday. Last week the parent of the L.I.R.R., the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, announced its emergency plans. About 60 percent of the daily riders, or 65,000 people, are expected to switch to the subways. People who usually ride the railroad are asked not to use the E and F trains, which are already beyond capacity, said the M.T.A., which also recommended buying tokens or Metrocards in advance.  <p>The A train is available from Howard Beach, where there is a parking lot that charges $2 for 12 hours and $6 for 24 hours. Travelers can also reach the A train by bus at Far Rockaway on the N-31, N-32 and N-33 routes.</p> <p>The IRT Flushing line No. 7 train from Shea Stadium also has a parking lot. It costs $3. The N-21 and N-20 buses connect with the line at Main Street, as will charter buses. The New York City Transit Authority plans additional trains on the A train and the Flushing line. The J and Z lines from Jamaica can be reached on the N-4 and Q-5 and Q-85 buses. Other alternatives are the N train from Astoria, the Q train at 21st Street in Long Island City and the IRT New Lots line.</p> <p>Extra buses will run in Queens on the Q-1, 2, 4, 5, 12, 13, 15, 16, 27, 27, 30, 36 and 43 lines. Long Island routes N-4, 6, 20, 22 and 24 plan to add buses. Most Island routes plan to extend service hours, with 24-hour operations on the N-4, 6, 20 and 22.</p> <p>Charter service will run from 5 A.M. to 10 A.M. and 3 P.M. to 8 P.M. on weekdays, with extremely limited off-peak and reverse service, the M.T.A. said. The fare will be $5. The routes cover the Fortunoff Backyard Store lot in Westbury and the Manhasset station and Shea Stadium and the Merrick station and Howard Beach. Buses From Suffolk</p> <p>Charter buses from Suffolk will travel to and from Howard Beach at a cost of $8.

486254>Amid Ceremony and Ingenuity, Kuwait&#39;s Oil-Well Fires Are Declared Out The last of the burning oil wells of Kuwait was extinguished and capped yesterday. The job took eight months, less time than almost anyone expected, at less expense in lives and money, and with very few technical innovations. The Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, walked across a red carpet to a blue lectern yesterday and pushed a lever that shut off a valve, news agencies reported.  <p>The well had been extinguished earlier and reignited yesterday morning for the occasion, and then put out by a Kuwaiti team with representatives of firefighters from other nations. Clean sand was trucked in to cover the oil-splattered ground in the area, in the Burgan field south of Kuwait City. Men with swords performed ceremonial dances.</p> <p>Simultaneously, crews were putting finishing touches on the last damaged wells elsewhere in the emirate.</p> <p>In February the retreating Iraqis blew up so many wells that no one could accurately count them, but last week American managers said 749 wells had been damaged, including 650 set ablaze.  Moats of Fire</p> <p>When the first firefighters arrived in March the task seemed herculean. And day by day the situation seemed to grow worse.</p> <p>Many wells gushed faster than they burned, so that they built themselves burning moats of oil, pools several acres in size. The air was so thick with smoke that by day it looked like night. And by night, each fire cast a glow like a setting sun, so that standing in an oilfield, it seemed as if a dozen suns were setting at various points on the horizon.</p> <p>Environmentalists feared that some wells could not be put out by conventional means, and that the smoke would rise to the upper atmosphere. But engineers, inventors and people with a lot of imagination began flooding the firefighters with ideas. At O.G.E. Drilling of Midland, Tex., the company hired by Kuwait to coordinate the oil-firefighting teams, T. B. O&#39;Brien, a principal, said he gave up counting at 700.</p> <p>For a time even some of the most experienced firefighters seemed daunted. Red Adair, such a figure of determination that John Wayne played him in a movie about firefighting, told Congress that it might take years.</p> <p>But old-fashioned firefighting techniques won out. In a telephone interview from Kuwait City last week, Thomas R. Heischman, of Bechtel Engineering, which provided logistical support, said, &quot;In the main, the firefighting teams used the tried and true methods.&quot; All it took, he said, was an army of nearly 10,000 workers from 34 countries, using 125,000 tons of heavy equipment, virtually all of it imported.</p> <p>Many wells have been put back to work. Before the war Kuwait had a daily production quota from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries of 1.5 million barrels and sometimes pumped more; Kuwait is now producing 320,000 barrels a day, and plans to be at 800,000 barrels a day by the middle of next year and two million barrels a day by the end of 1993.</p> <p>When the Iraqis were ousted by allied forces in February, the wells were gushing an estimated six million barrels a day. Most burned but some simply spread across the desert, where part evaporated in the fierce heat and part formed a tarry asphalt. This will likely be in place for years to come.</p> <p>The Kuwaiti Oil Minister, Hamoud al-Ruqba, told reporters yesterday that the value of the lost oil was $12 billion, compared to an earlier projected figure of $43 billion. The lower figure implies losses of about 600 million barrels, equivalent to more than three months&#39; worldwide consumption.</p> <p>Scientists have speculated that some of the oil is sinking into the ground, although in many places in Kuwait, kicking the oil-soaked sand reveals a clean layer underneath. Righting Wrong Techniques</p> <p>For humans, the main hazard of oil in the ground is contamination of underground water supplies, but such supplies are relatively sparse in Kuwait to begin with. The question of the effect of air pollution on the local population is still largely unanswered.</p> <p>In putting out the fires, the work went swiftly once the people and equipment were in place. It took six months, until Sept. 8, to do the first half of the wells, and less than two months for the second half.</p> <p>&quot;In the beginning it was done backward,&quot; Mr. Heischman said. Firefighers were rushed in, arriving in teams of 8 to 10 with only highly specialized equipment. In normal circumstances, he said, they are called in by an oil company that has a single well on fire, &quot;and that company diverts all its assets to the operation.&quot;</p> <p>In this case, it was not until after the firefighters arrived that Kuwait began the process of massing the tractors, machine shops, piping and other support needed. Last, he said, came specialists to remove mines and unexploded cluster bombs so workers could move around freely.</p> <p>Among the ideas that poured in, Mr. O&#39;Brien said, was one from a retired osteopathic surgeon who wanted to drop a 10-million-pound candle snuffer on burning wells from three helicopters. How to get a helicopter to fly through the smoke was not explained.</p> <p>In April, after the first month of painstakingly slow work, a frustrated Kuwaiti Government announced that it would supplement the four North American firefighting teams -- three Texan and one from Alberta -- with others from Iran, China, and anywhere else volunteers could be found. The Companies That Did It</p> <p>In the end, 27 teams were working, with the four original companies putting out about three-quarters of the fires. Those four were the Red Adair Company, Wild Well Control and Boots &amp; Coots, all from Texas, and Safety Boss, of Calgary, Alberta.</p> <p>The Kuwaiti Oil Minister, Mr. Ruqba, said yesterday that the job had cost $1.5 billion, but other executives on the project said it was about $2.2 billion. Immediately after the war, the guesses had been twice that or more.</p> <p>Mr. Ruqba said the fires and gushers consumed 3 percent of Kuwait&#39;s oil reserves.</p> <p>Five men were killed in April -- two journalists and three oilfield workers, whose vehicles were incinerated in a burning pool of oil. A sixth man was killed when he stepped on a mine or an unexploded anti-personnel bomb, Mr. O&#39;Brien said. Ingenious Methods</p> <p>Mr. Heischman of Bechtel said a seventh, a welder, died when he was run over by a bulldozer while working on a pipeline to recover spilled crude oil. He added that there were seven burn injuries in the project, five serious.</p> <p>Some new methods were used. Early on, teams used liquid nitrogen to smother fires. A team from Hungary put two jet engines on top of a captured Iraqi tank and introduced water into the stream of gas the jets produced, Mr. Heischman said, blowing a high-velocity fog at the fires and &quot;essentially blowing them out.&quot;</p> <p>The Canadian team, Safety Boss, used dry chemicals on stubborn fires, said Brian McCutcheon, a spokesman for the company in Calgary. Safety Boss led the pack with 180 wells capped, he said.</p> <p>Mr. O&#39;Brien said that fires were not the worst problem; capping a bent or shredded wellhead was. Still, he said, &quot;the folks that wrote all this and talked about it on television were enthralled by the business of putting out the fires,&quot; because that was the most dramatic part.</p>
795096>Faucets That Pass the Lead Test HUNDREDS of faucet models sold at retail stores around the country will soon carry a new symbol certifying that they meet a safety standard for lead, cadmium, mercury and other toxic substances.  Faucets made by six manufacturers passed tests in which water was held in them for specified periods over the course of 19 days. Then the water was tested to determine whether it had picked up any of the substances, some of which are often used in making faucets themselves.  <p>The standard was developed jointly by the plumbing industry, public health officials and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The tests were carried out by NSF International, formerly the National Sanitation Foundation, a standards setting group in Ann Arbor, Mich., whose logo will appear on the boxes of faucets that passed.  Using an approved faucet will not guarantee that the water is safe to drink, only that the faucet itself did not contribute more of a contaminant than the standard allows. For lead, the faucet can contribute no more than 11 parts per billion.  &quot;This is the first time that consumers can ever make an educated choice about a faucet based on health effects, by looking for the NSF mark,&quot; said Dr. Ann Marie Gebhart, a vice president of NSF.</p> <p>Several faucets that failed the test are being redesigned by the manufacturers, she said.  Lead, the contaminant of most concern to experts, can depress intelligence, especially in children. It can also cause high blood pressure, kidney damage and infertility.  Often, the amount of lead in the water depends on the chemistry of the water itself before it gets to the faucet: if the pH is low, the water tends to leach lead out of pipes. The NSF tests were done with this chemically &quot;aggressive&quot; water.</p> <p>The acceptable levels also apply to refrigerator ice makers and kitchen instant-hot-water taps.  The manufacturers are expected to start putting the NSF symbol on packaging within weeks. The manufacturers are the Haws Drinking Faucet Company of Berkeley, Calif.; Modern Faucet Manufacturing of Los Angeles; Moen Inc. of North Olmstead, Ohio; Neoperl Inc. of Waterbury, Conn., Price Pfister Inc. of Pacoima, Calif., and the Zin-Plas Corporation of Walker, Mich.  The full list of approved faucet models is available by calling NSF at (800) 673-8010. Those with access to the Internet can find the list at http://www.nsf.com.</p>
1490932>Crash That Killed 21 Appears Tied to Excess Weight and Maintenance Error, Officials Say A commuter plane that crashed on takeoff from Charlotte, N.C., in January was 400 to 1,000 pounds overweight, and two bags in its tail baggage compartment were so heavy that it took two handlers to carry each of them, a sign that the plane was tail-heavy as well, people involved in the investigation said. But government investigators said the flight would probably have been completed without incident if not for a maintenance error two days before, which they said they believed left the pilots unable to get full motion out of the mechanism that raises the tail and lowers the nose. The plane, US Airways Express flight 5481, a Beech 1900d, tilted up to 52 degrees above the horizontal, and then fell out of the sky. Both pilots and all 19 passengers were killed.  <p>Safety issues involving overweight planes have received new attention since the crash. Suspecting that the accident involved overloading of the plane, the F.A.A. ordered the operators of small planes to conduct a survey of the weight of passengers and their bags, and adjust their assumptions accordingly. Last week it told the operators of large planes that they, too, should raise their assumptions by 10 pounds per passenger and 5 pounds per checked bag.</p> <p>But while weight guidelines are important, they are not hard and fast rules.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The plane is very forgiving; it&#39;s a very rugged airframe,&#39;&#39; said one investigator, who said that the manufacturer&#39;s specification for weight was &#39;&#39;not a drop-dead number.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Investigators have reviewed tests that the National Transportation Safety Board performed after another Beech 1900 crashed in Homer, Alaska, in November 1987. Those tests showed that an overweight, tail-heavy plane was flyable, they said.</p> <p>The safety board will open two days of hearings into the probable cause of the crash on Tuesday. The board does not determine fault.</p> <p>The airline Air Midwest, the manufacturer and the company that serviced the plane, still may face the question of how to divide the cost of settlements or judgments in suits brought by the families of the passengers and crew.</p> <p>The hearings will focus heavily on maintenance. The plane&#39;s last servicing, where investigators say that a technician made a mistake in the way he connected the cables that run from the controls in the cockpit to the parts on the tail that change the plane&#39;s pitch, was at a hangar in Huntington, W.Va., operated by Raytheon Aerospace. Despite the fact that Air Midwest had contracted out its maintenance, it remained responsible for the work done, and the F.A.A. was supposed to check that the shop was following the rules.</p> <p>The agency said its maintenance inspector made two visits to the shop where the Beech 1900d was serviced, one in July, soon after it opened, and one in September. But the agency acknowledged that the visits were not listed in its computer system, the system it uses to spot trends. That problem was first reported on Tuesday by The Charlotte Observer.</p> <p>There is substantial evidence that the plane was overweight and tail-heavy. Investigators gathered the luggage out of the wreckage, dried it, and found that it came to more than 900 pounds, according to investigators, even after some of it had burned. They are not certain, though, whether all the baggage came from the tail compartment, or whether some was carry-on baggage.</p> <p>Placement of the luggage is important because if the plane&#39;s load was concentrated in the tail, pushing the nose down after the takeoff climb would be more difficult.</p> <p>After the crash, Air Midwest and other carriers were ordered to survey a sample of their passengers, and their baggage, to determine if the weight assumptions were correct. On average, airlines flying small planes raised their assumption of weight by 30 pounds for each passenger with a bag, but Air Midwest raised its estimate by 40 pounds.</p>
416542>Oil Traders Are Calm At Deadline The oil market stared war in the face yesterday, and barely moved. In a market that has been gyrating with every whisper of Persian Gulf news, trading was notably contained as the midnight deadline for Iraq to pull out of Kuwait approached. Experts said the lack of news to change expectations on prices -- which jumped on Monday to over $30 a barrel -- appeared to dominate trading.  <p>For now, &quot;basically, all the bad news is out, and all the good news is out, too,&quot; said John H. Lichtblau of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, explaining the tepid trading on what was very likely the eve of a confrontation the market had feared for months.  Everyone Talks War</p> <p>Everyone is talking war, he said, but global oil supplies are high and Saudi Arabia seems to be heavily defended.</p> <p>Crude oil for February delivery closed down 71 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange, at $30.07, having wandered over the relatively small range of $1.50 in the course of the day.</p> <p>Stocks, facing the same uncertainty, stumbled up and down. At the close the Dow was at 2,490.59, up 6.68. Treasury notes and bonds dipped in light trading, the dollar was little changed and gold fell slightly.</p> <p>With a deadline for war near, some oil users might have been tempted to buy extra supplies, but Mr. Lichtblau pointed out, &quot;You take a risk if you buy oil at $35 or $40; if there is a war, it could be short-lived, or it may not affect supplies.&quot;  Saudi Oilfield Security</p> <p>In either case, a buyer could find his inventory worth much less in a few days. Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist and senior managing director at Bear, Stearns &amp; Company, said yesterday, &quot;The Iraqi Air Force threat to the Saudi oilfields is the key threat that has been hanging up the market for weeks.&quot; If the United States and its allies achieve quick air superiority, he said, oil will tumble. Stocks, he added, would follow with a &quot;multi-hundred-point rally.&quot;</p> <p>Shahrokh Nikkhah, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., had another theory for why oil went lower yesterday. &quot;I think the market&#39;s trying to tell us that there is not going to be a war,&quot; he said. President Saddam Hussein, he said, might feel after the deadline passes that his pride and face had been maintained, and that diplomacy was now possible.</p> <p>Among the oil companies, however, there were signs that a rough stretch lies ahead. Mobil and Phillips Petroleum announced steps to limit hoarding.</p> <p>Mobil said it had asked its bulk customers if they would restrict their purchases of gasoline and heating oil to 100 percent of the volume for which they had contracted, which, the company noted, was more oil than most of them generally buy.</p> <p>The company said that some of its terminals &quot;have been hit by withdrawals greatly in excess of local demand,&quot; but that &quot;there is no industry shortage of petroleum products, and industry inventories are adequate to meet normal demand.&quot;</p> <p>Phillips said customers who buy in a single day more than 1/30th of their monthly contract volume of gasoline or distillates would be charged an additional 10 cents a gallon for excess gallons. Distillates are primarily heating oil and diesel oil.  Speculators Liquidate</p> <p>While some distributors may be stocking up, the only hectic trading in the pits on the futures exchange was at the end of the day, when &quot;locals,&quot; or speculators who buy and sell on their own account, without ever taking delivery, decided to liquidate their positions rather than go home last night holding fixed-price obligations that could wipe them out.</p> <p>&quot;People are not willing to be wrong,&quot; said Tom Blakeslee, an analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group, of Hoboken, N.J.</p> <p>Early in the day, locals had guessed that prices would rise, and bought contracts that obligated them to buy oil at a future date, according to market-watchers. If war fears rose, the value of these contracts would rise.</p> <p>&quot;But we got near the end of the day,&quot; said Thomas R. Sparico, managing director of Geldermann Energy, a brokerage house, &quot;and the phones never lit up with the rest of the world coming to buy.&quot; So the locals liquidated their positions, and the price sank.  Heating Oil Also Falls</p> <p>Heating oil also fell, by 4.28 cents, to 84.7 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline was down by 5.22 cents to 77.04 cents a gallon.</p> <p>Most experts still expect a price spike if shooting breaks out, but are beginning to doubt it will be very big.</p> <p>On the eve of the United Nations deadline for Iraq to get out of Kuwait, the American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil stocks for the week ending Jan. 11 rose to 323 million barrels, from 321.7 million the previous week. The figure compares to 345.1 million barrels last year.</p> <p>Stocks of heating oil and other distillates were in a normal seasonal decline, said the institute, the industry&#39;s main trade association. Gasoline stocks were off from the previous week but ahead of last year. Crude imports, however, were way down: 5.4 million barrels a day, the same as the earlier week, compared with 6.2 million barrels last year.</p>
407652>Oil Price Down Again on Hostage Decision The decision by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to free all hostages helped send oil prices plummeting at the opening yesterday, adding to the sharp drop the day before on hopes for peace. But the market began rising later in the day, as traders wondered exactly how far the crisis stands from peaceful resolution. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery next month fell 89 cents a barrel, to $26.40, the lowest close since Aug. 29. The price of oil has dropped $4.26 a barrel over the last two days.  <p>At one point in the morning yesterday, oil was trading as low as $25.25 a barrel. On Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait, the similar contract closed at $21.54. Analysts differ on exactly how low the price would be without the threat of war but agree that most of the &quot;war premium&quot; is gone.</p> <p>In a separate action, the New York Mercantile Exchange said yesterday that it had formulated new rules to deal with extreme volatility in prices. Under the proposal, trading would cease for the day if the price of oil moved $15 a barrel in either direction on the contracts for the nearest two months, and it would close for one hour if the price moved $7.50.</p> <p>The change must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and market experts pointed out that both of the new proposed limits were far larger than even the biggest move this year, which was a $5.41-a-barrel decline, on Oct. 19.</p> <p>Analysts attributed the move over the last two days to the perception of a sharply lower risk of war.</p> <p>&quot;People have been taken to the brink of peace and looked in -- and it&#39;s concentrated their minds,&quot; said Michael C. Lynch, a senior research associate at the Washington International Energy Group.</p> <p>But referring to a possible visit to Washington by the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, Mr. Lynch warned that the price could shoot up again. &quot;If Aziz comes to Washington and says, &#39;If the Israelis get out of the West Bank we&#39;ll be happy,&#39; and then Bush says, &#39;Go home,&#39; then the war premium goes back up to $10,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Some people noted that Mr. Hussein had not said exactly how and when the hostages would be leaving. &quot;One has to give a lot of credit to Saddam Hussein for his deft manipulation of our psyches,&quot; said Peter C. Beutel of Pegasus Econometrics in Hoboken, N.J.</p> <p>&#39;All the Good News Is Out&#39;</p> <p>Shahrokh Nikkhah, vice president for futures at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the market had descended a little too low this morning in its expectation of peace. Explaining the turn back up in price he said, &quot;I think today people looked at the substance of the differences between Iraq and the United States and realized there is still a big difference.&quot;</p> <p>Of the price between now and Jan. 15, the deadline set by the United Nations Security Council resolution for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, he said unhappy surprises were possible.</p> <p>&quot;All the good news is out now,&quot; he said. &quot;Any news that could come up now, unfortunately, is that there are differences between the United States and Iraq.&quot;</p> <p>Another trader, Tom Bentz of United Energy Inc., said: &quot;People are reading a lot in between the lines of what&#39;s actually being said. I personally don&#39;t think we&#39;re that close to a peaceful solution.&quot; He said that the market could turn around and move up today.</p> <p>The Merc&#39;s Proposal</p> <p>Under the details of the rules announced today by the Mercantile Exchange to curb price volatility, if the price moved $7.50 a barrel, or 20 cents a gallon for oil products, and trading was halted, then when it resumed, movement would be limited to another $7.50 a barrel in the same direction. There would be no time out, however, if the limit was reached in the last two minutes of a trading session. There would also be no limits in the last half-hour of the day of the contract&#39;s expiration.</p> <p>A pause, said Z. Lou Guttman, chairman of the exchange, would allow opportunity &quot;for additional information dissemination, the review of margins and other financial considerations, consultation between Government officials and the exchange board and staff,&quot; and for consultation by traders with customers.</p> <p>The most prominent of the exchange&#39;s critics, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said yesterday in a statement that &quot;a $15-per-barrel increase in one day is still huge and unacceptable.&quot; He pointed out that some analysts had predicted a price of $100 a barrel in case of war. &quot;Still,&quot; he added, &quot;I appreciate the fact that Nymex has the foresight to announce its plans, however modest they are, in advance.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Bentz of United Energy praised the proposed rules. &quot;Markets sometimes have a way in panic situations of overdoing things,&quot; he said. A break in trading, he added, would be a chance to pause &quot;until the market can get ahold of what&#39;s really going on and people can calm themselves.&quot;</p> <p>But Mr. Beutel said the limit was unlikely to be reached in all but the most extreme circumstances.</p> <p>&quot;You&#39;d have to catch everybody by surprise with something humongous in terms of news,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Correction:  December 20, 1990, Thursday</p> <p>An article in Business Day on Dec.7 about a rule change proposed by the New York Mercantile Exchange to curb volatility in oil trading misstated what would happen if the price moved by the daily limit, $15 a barrel up or down, on the contracts for the nearest two months. If that limit was reached, trading could continue, but only at prices within the $15 limit. It would not be halted.</p>
829608>German Tourist Plane Crashes; 189 Feared Dead A Boeing 757 carrying 189 people, mostly tourists on their way home to Berlin and Frankfurt from the Dominican Republic, crashed into the Atlantic late Tuesday about 13 miles offshore. At least 105 bodies were recovered, American officials said, but The Associated Press quoted a Dominican civil defense official, Domingo Antonio Vargas, as saying as many as 126 bodies had been found by late yesterday. Debris was spread in an area two miles long and 150 yards wide, the United States Coast Guard said, suggesting that the jet broke up before it hit the water.  <p>But an official at the German Embassy in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, said the fuel had not caught fire, indicating that the plane had not exploded.</p> <p>The official, the first secretary at the Embassy, said bad weather was likely the cause. &quot;More than 50 percent, it was the interference of bad weather,&quot; the official, Klaus D. Brock, said in a telephone interview. The plane had taken off from Puerto Plata, about 100 miles northwest of Santo Domingo.</p> <p>The crash was the second recent loss of a Boeing 757 in flight: In December a 757 crashed near Cali, Colombia; pilot error appears to have been the primary cause.</p> <p>Aviation officials in Puerto Plata gave conflicting information about the flight, which reached an altitude of about 7,000 feet before crashing.</p> <p>Gen. Hector Ramon, head of the civil aviation agency, said the pilot had radioed the tower that he had a problem and was returning, The A.P. reported.</p> <p>But Maj. Emmanuel Souffront, of the Dominican Air Force, said a transcript of radio communication indicated there had not been a problem. &quot;The aircraft started to turn to the right and disappeared from the radar screen,&quot; he was quoted by The A.P. as saying. &quot;Before it went down, someone radioed from the aircraft, &#39;Stand by.&#39; &quot;</p> <p>In Berlin and Frankfurt, friends and family of the passengers arrived at the  airports yesterday to find flags flying at half staff and teams of doctors, psychologists and clergy to meet them.</p> <p>The 11-year-old plane, originally built for Eastern Air Lines, was owned by a Turkish company and under lease, with a crew, to a Dominican airline, Alas de Transporte Internacional, for a single flight. It carried 176 passengers, including 4 children. Eleven of the crew were Turkish and two Dominican.</p> <p>The Turkish company, Birgen Air, was using the plane to fill a charter commitment to a German company, Oger Tours of Hamburg. Wolfgang Schwalm, a spokesman for the Frankfurt airport, said the Boeing 757 had replaced a Boeing 767 at the last minute because the 767 had technical problems.</p> <p>In Istanbul, the general manager of Birgen said on television that he believed the plane had been hit by lightning. But the jet is designed to withstand any such strikes.</p> <p>The United States Coast Guard dispatched three cutters to help retrieve bodies. Germany sent two civil aviation officials and three officials from the Federal Police in Weisbaden to help identify bodies.</p> <p>The Federal Aviation Administration said it would send experts to assist investigators, and the National Transportation Safety Board said it would send investigators if more evidence became available.</p> <p>But it was not clear who would pay to retrieve the plane&#39;s data recorder from the wreckage, off the north coast of the Dominican Republic where the water is about 3,000 feet deep. Retrieval could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Though the plane was American built, neither it nor the airline nor the flight was under American jurisdiction, and no Americans were on board.</p> <p>Nevertheless, American safety experts said they would be very interested in learning more about the crash if it was caused by mechanical problems or by weather.</p> <p>In Berlin, Franz-Josef Schneider, a spokesman for the Transport Ministry, said of recovering the data recorder: &quot;People have discussed it, but I can&#39;t say anything more. A decision will be made after the different countries have a chance to consult.&quot;</p> <p>At Schonefeld Airport in Berlin, where the flight was scheduled to make its first stop, passengers waited to board a charter flight to the Dominican Republic even as weeping relatives of passengers on the earlier flight made their way into and out of the terminal.</p> <p>Many passengers expressed misgivings about boarding the flight, but no one canceled. &quot;I do have mixed feeelings,&quot; an elderly man said, &quot;but there isn&#39;t going to be another crash right away.&quot;</p> <p>As people drove into the parking lot at Berlin airport, they were met by two  women. When they rolled their car windows down, one woman asked, &quot;Are you here for the plane from the Dominican Republic?&quot;</p> <p>Those who said yes were accompanied into the terminal to meet with doctors, psychologists and members of the clergy.</p> <p>The chief of the airport firefighting squad, Klaus Walter, 54, said: &quot;First comes a phase of silence. Then come the tears.&quot;</p> <p>The German pilots&#39; association, which has campaigned for tighter regulation of foreign flights landing in Germany, especially from Latin America, the Caribbean and the nations in the former Soviet Union, reacted strongly to news of the crash.</p> <p>&quot;For months we have been demanding that planes that serve the German market should be made to meet German safety standards,&quot; said a spokesman, Oliver Will.</p>
1579542>That Yellow Taxi May Be Turning Green HYBRID cars&#39; first buyers were environmentalists willing to pay extra for a vehicle that was cleaner and more efficient. The next market may be taxicabs. Andrew Grant, a taxi owner-operator in Vancouver, British Columbia, bought a 2001 Toyota Prius in the fall of 2000, and drove it nearly 200,000 miles before he replaced it with a 2004 model. &#39;&#39;The car actually pays for itself,&#39;&#39; he said.  <p>R. Seth Riney, an entrepreneur in the Boston area, is running a fleet of three Prius hybrids as a livery service. He expects delivery of two more cars in May and five more before the Democratic National Convention in August. The hybrids cost more than ordinary cars, but he said he persuaded the city of Cambridge to break a five-year moratorium on new livery services because his, called PlanetTran, was environmentally friendly. The same pitch pulls in customers, he said, and he gets a break on fees at Logan Airport under a clean-air program.</p> <p>In New York City, Bart Chezar, a transportation consultant, is lining up agreements that would let Toyota Highlander or Lexus RX400h hybrids, which will reach market in the coming months, be used as &#39;&#39;black cars,&#39;&#39; which provide radio-dispatched car service.</p> <p>There are 12,000 black cars in New York. He said that for each car replaced with a hybrid, the operator would save $3,800 a year (at $2 a gallon), and reduce pollution, too.</p> <p>Indeed, experts argue that hybrids are far more useful in for-hire car services than in private hands.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The more fuel you put through this technology, the greater your savings,&#39;&#39; said Joseph R. Wagner, a senior project manager at the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. A typical taxi uses 7,000 to 7,500 gallons a year, versus 500 to 600 gallons for a private car.</p> <p>Private cars spend a lot of time on the highway, where hybrids have a limited advantage. But taxis live in stop-and-go traffic, where hybrids thrive. The Prius does not idle, because its electric motor moves it at low speeds and its gas engine kicks in only when it can run productively. The Prius and other hybrids have regenerative braking to capture energy ordinarily lost to braking, and convert it into electricity. A side benefit is reduced wear on the brakes.</p> <p>Mr. Grant said he usually replaced the front brakes after 28,000 miles, but on his first Prius, the first set lasted 90,000 miles.</p> <p>And because the engine does not idle, he said he did not need to replace the timing belt or fuel injector, and did not have to adjust the valves. He reported no expenses for the electric drive system in 200,000 miles.</p>
1805731>G.E. and Hitachi Will Merge Their Nuclear Power Units General Electric and Hitachi will merge their nuclear power businesses, the companies said on Monday, to provide services to owners of old reactors and to build new ones. The announcement is another sign of global retrenchment in the field.  <p>G.E. is competing to sell new reactors in the United States against Westinghouse, which is owned by Toshiba, and Areva, a French-German consortium. But with a 30-year gap in nuclear orders in this country, all three companies have limited experience in construction of the models they want to sell here.</p> <p>John Krenicki, the president and chief executive of GE Energy, who spoke at the GE Research Center here, said of his new partner, Hitachi: &#39;&#39;They&#39;re currently building many new plants, and we see that as a major asset, being able to tap into that experience base.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Akira Maru, chief executive of Hitachi Power Systems, said the company had one plant under construction in Japan and two in licensing. It has been in the nuclear business for more than 50 years, he said.</p> <p>There are 95 reactors around the world that use the boiling-water design, the kind that G.E. builds, and Hitachi has been involved in 63 of them, Hitachi said.</p> <p>The G.E. design boils water directly in the reactor vessel and uses it to spin a turbine, creating mechanical energy that is used to make electricity. Models marketed by other companies heat water in the reactor but keep it under pressure so it does not boil; that water is run through a heat exchanger to make steam. Advocates of the boiling water design say it gets more work out of the uranium fuel, and requires less steel and concrete.</p> <p>Hitachi will take a 40 percent share of G.E.&#39;s existing nuclear business, and G.E. will take about 20 percent of Hitachi&#39;s existing nuclear business, the companies said. The deal is supposed to close in the first half of next year. G.E.&#39;s fuel business is not part of the arrangement.</p> <p>General Electric&#39;s main design, the &#39;&#39;economic simplified boiling water reactor,&#39;&#39; has no orders yet but three companies are seriously considering ordering it. They are Dominion, for its North Anna site in Virginia; Entergy, for River Bend in Louisiana; and NuStart, a consortium established to build reactors, for Grand Gulf in Mississippi.</p> <p>Two companies are considering building another G.E. model, the advanced boiling water reactor.</p>
175657>Utilities Pay Builders to Cut Power Use ONCE upon a time, when power was cheap and everyone thought progress meant using more of it, utility companies used to advise architects and developers on ways to raise electricity consumption in new buildings. The theory was that workers could be more productive in buildings with more artificial lighting and with cooling systems built without regard for the sun and other natural factors.  <p>These days, however, when high costs and environmental restrictions make the building of new generating plants extraordinarily difficult, the utilities have a different message for builders and designers: Buildings can do very well with less electricity, much less.</p> <p>And commercial landlords, who now see electric costs as the largest single expense of operating a building, are increasingly receptive. Even builders of speculative structures, who put up an office building without ever planning to pay the operating expenses and then sell it to a buyer who wants to pay the lowest possible price, are beginning to see the virtues of designing for energy efficiency, utilities say.</p> <p>To push conservation along, some utilities are even making direct payments to builders to help them make the added investment needed to acquire extra efficient equipment that can save substantial amounts of energy.</p> <p>The Consolidated Edison Company, for one, expects to spend about $1 million this year in helping landlords in a conservation district it has established in the East Midtown area of Manhattan running from 44th to 52d Streets east of Fifth Avenue.</p> <p>In one case, Con Edison is expected to give more than $50,000 to Van Dorn Realty to spend on measures to cut electric consumption in its office buildings at 733 and 825 Third Avenue - in effect, paying its customer to buy less.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The Con Edison rebate program is a pilot project designed to test whether rebates will encourage our customers to install more efficient equipment and significantly reduce the demand during summer peak periods,&#39;&#39; said Alfred M. Ornstein, director of commercial and industrial conservation services. &#39;&#39;This may be less expensive than investing in new power plants and distribution systems.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Northeast Utilities, which serves most of Connecticut and a portion of western Massachusetts, is taking an even broader approach, paying handsomely for a variety of energy-saving measures.</p> <p>The company, which expects to spend almost $20 million on conservation in both residences and commercial buildings this year, will provide free audits for houses, apartments and factories, free installation of weatherstripping, subsidies for insulation, and free sample high-efficiency light bulbs. The company&#39;s program includes providing the owners of commercial buildings with &#39;&#39;contract arranger services,&#39;&#39; by paying for engineering studies, evaluating bids for making energy improvements and identifying financing options.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;ll hold their hands,&#39;&#39; said Earl F. Taylor Jr., Northeast&#39;s director of conservation programs.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I&#39;ve been talking about energy efficiency for years,&#39;&#39; said William Ellis, chairman of the board of Northeast Utilities. &#39;&#39;This financial incentive will make the difference.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>He made his remarks at a news conference last spring where he and officials of the state and environmentalists described a new program of efficiency incentives. Last month the program was adopted by several other utilities around New England.</p> <p>Northeast adopted the program because cutting growth in electric demand reduces the need for new power plants, which saves them money. Con Edison has a related problem; it has plenty of generating capacity at present, but will need to spend millions of dollars on improving its distribution system in the East Midtown area unless it can cut the growth in electric load.</p> <p>The irony faced by the utilities is that they will sometimes add generating or distribution equipment that will not pay for itself for 20 years, while their customers will reject efficiency improvements that have a payback period of only four or five years. Cash payments from utility to customer is one way to bring those values into balance.</p> <p>Many utilities across the country offer subsidies to residential customers to help them use electricity more efficiently. But heavy subsidies for commercial buildings are unusual.</p> <p>A striking feature of the Northeast Utilities program is free assistance to architects. In a guidebook designed for architects, the utility says that it has 50 energy-saving ideas for a new 60,000-square-foot suburban office building that could cut load by as much as 37 percent, without raising construction costs.</p> <p>Getting in at the preconstruction stage is important, according to Douglas Foy, director of the Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental organization that negotiated the conservation plan with Northeast. The reason is that unless energy needs are considered, he explained, a developer is building the equivalent of a &#39;&#39;gas guzzler.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Unlike cars,&#39;&#39; he stressed, &#39;&#39;these things last for 50, 100 or 200 years. They doom you.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Northeast used a computer program developed by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for the Federal Department of Energy, and analyzed the effects of various changes. Some were not obvious at first glance.</p> <p>For example, Northeast found, builders often face a choice between tinted glass and reflective glass to hold down the effect of the summer sun. The reflective glass is more effective, but also more expensive to buy.</p> <p>But the study suggested that choosing the reflective glass is cheaper because it permits installation of a substantially smaller air-conditioning unit. The savings on the less expensive air-conditioner will more than pay for the reflective glass.</p> <p>The study also reported that attic and wall insulation, one of the most common energy-saving investments in a new house, was a poor investment in an office building. The reason is that holding in the heat in winter is not nearly as important as taking out the heat that builds up in summer, from lighting and equipment as well as from the sun.</p> <p>Another idea was &#39;&#39;workstation conditioning.&#39;&#39; Just as engineers now plan differing light levels for different areas - lower in corridors, for example, and higher at the desktop - the Northeast study proposed heating and cooling ducts at desktop, and less summer cooling and winter heating where no one spends long periods, like hallways.</p> <p>IT also recommended ceiling-height windows, which permit daylight to penetrate deeper into a building. Moreover, the study pointed out, &#39;&#39;lightshelves&#39;&#39; under the windows could bounce light up on to the ceiling and even farther into a room.</p> <p>These measures can be combined with electronic switches that vary the intensity of the lights according to how bright it is outside, adding only what is needed to reach a preset illumination level. The study showed that this strategy could cut annual electric consumption nearly 10 percent.</p> <p>The computer showed that part of the gain was in less electricity needed for lighting, and part was because air-conditioning costs are saved whenever lights, which generate heat, are removed.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Everybody&#39;s going for lighting,&#39;&#39; said Peter M. Miller, a research analyst at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, based in Washington. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s a really good payback on it, and it&#39;s easy to do, incrementally or all at once.&#39;&#39; But, he said, landlords and tenants still resist the idea of spending a lot for devices they are used to buying cheaply; a high-efficiency bulb, for example, can be a bargain at $40, but that is not what people are used to. &#39;&#39;Part of it is just nonrational behavior,&#39;&#39; Mr. Miller said.</p> <p>He pointed out that President Reagan on June 29 signed a new law that raises the minimum allowable efficiency for a ballast, the device between the building wiring and the light tube. The standard, which takes effect in 1990, will require 10 percent more efficiency than in older models. A third design that is 25 percent more efficient is available, but not called for in the law.</p> <p>Even so, building owners and tenants will save $11 billion by 2000 because of the new law, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimated. Many savings can be achieved in older buildings, and New York is a prime candidate for such savings because its power costs are the highest of any major city in the nation.</p> <p>Savings can be hard to come by, said Harvey Brickman, first vice president of Tishman Realty and Construction, because the increasing number of computers not only use a lot of power, but throw off heat as well.</p> <p>But the incentive is there, he said, because annual electricity costs can run from $2.80 to $3.30 a square foot. In contrast, he said, the whole operating cost of a building is typically $7 to $9 a square foot a year. Energy is sometimes the largest single operating expense, he said, the only rival being personnel costs.</p> <p>But conservation can be expensive, Mr. Brickman pointed out. He said that by offering rebates, Con Edison is &#39;&#39;tacitly admitting that it costs you money to save energy.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Some efficiency improvements are put in place without subsidies, however.</p> <p>At 733 and 825 Third Avenue, for example, workers for Van Dorn Realty, a subsidiary of the Durst Organization, are making changes in lighting that are invisible to tenants, but evident on the electric bill. Joshua L. Durst, the property manager, said that before the rebate program, he was switching to more efficient lighting equipment whenever a floor was remodeled, but he was not replacing the others.</p> <p>Mr. Durst said the two buildings together have about 5,000 ceiling-light fixtures, each with four 40-watt fluorescent tubes and two 40-watt ballasts. At a cost of $60, including installation, the two ballasts can be replaced with models that do the same job but use only 20 watts each, and the 40-watt bulbs can be replaced with 34-watt models that give the same light.</p> <p>THE result is to cut the energy use of each fixture from 240 to 176 watts. According to Mr. Durst, the lights are on for 14 to 15 hours a day, so the savings would come to about 900 watt-hours daily. At current prices, that comes to about 14 cents per fixture per day, or $17,700 a year.</p> <p>But Con Edison is paying $25 of each $60 conversion. So with the job a little more than half done, Con Edison has paid him $27,000.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We expect this is slightly better than break-even project, but I emphasize slightly,&#39;&#39; he said in an interview. He said he was inclined to do the job out of concern for the environment as well as for the financial gain. &#39;&#39;With the nuclear waste, the acid rain and the imported oil, it just doesn&#39;t make any sense to use more electricity,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>To save money, he has already had tinted plastic sheets applied to the insides of the windows, to reduce heating from the sun. But Mr. Durst said that he had found limits to energy saving technologies.</p> <p>For example, Mr. Durst was interviewed while he sat in the office of the building manager, which is equipped with a motion detector that turns out the lights if it senses that the room is empty for more than a few minutes. The hallway outside the office has a similar sensor, and the lights there blinked on and off as office workers came through.</p> <p>Mr. Durst said that he had tried the sensors, which cost $200 each to install, in some other offices, but that &#39;&#39;it&#39;s a very difficult sell to tenants.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Employees do not like them because they do not like coming into a dark room, he said. So their use is limited to bathrooms and some hallways and mechanical rooms that are not used by the public.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You don&#39;t want to be on the cutting edge of this technology,&#39;&#39; he explained.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Durst said he wished Con Edison would extend its conservation zone to take in another building his company owns, at 205 East 42d Street, now facing the possibility of needing new wiring for additional computers and other electric devices unknown when it was built, in 1928.</p> <p>The Northeast Utilities conservation program dwells heavily on lighting and cooling in new office buildings, but will also focus on existing homes, offices and factories. The company expects to spend substantially more in the future; it will recover the money, plus profit, through electric sales.</p> <p>If the conservation increases its spare capacity, the utility can then rent that surplus to neighboring utilities that are short of power - at a profit.</p>
1715765>Ford to Subsidize Ethanol Pumps in Midwest Ford, in partnership with the ethanol producer VeraSun Energy, plans to announce today that it will subsidize the installation of ethanol fuel pumps at gas stations around the Midwest. Ford also said it would increase the number of vehicles it builds that can burn fuel with as much as 85 percent ethanol. In addition, Ford said it would work with dealers to emphasize the availability of ethanol-burning cars in areas where the fuel is sold.  <p>Ordinary cars can burn fuel that is up to 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline. About five million &#39;&#39;flexible fuel&#39;&#39; cars and trucks can run on ethanol in any mixture up to 85 percent. But the fuel, known as E-85, is available at only about 500 stations, of some 180,000 stations nationwide. Nearly all of them are in the Midwest, because ethanol is produced from crops grown there, and is difficult to ship.</p> <p>Even in the Midwest, though, sales of E-85 are held down. Bill Honnef, vice president for sales and marketing at VeraSun, which is based in Brookings, S.D., said in a statement that &#39;&#39;nearly 70 percent of flexible-fuel vehicle owners are unaware they are driving one.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Ford said it had a million flexible-fuel vehicles on the road and would build as many as 250,000 next year. For the first time it will add the F-150, the Crown Victoria, the Mercury Grand Marquis and the Lincoln Town Car to the list of vehicles in which a flexible-fuel option is available.</p> <p>Ford will subsidize &#39;&#39;under 100&#39;&#39; new pumps at gas stations in the Midwest, a spokeswoman, Chris Morrisroe, said. She would not say how much the company was spending.</p> <p>Ford and other companies built the flexible-fuel vehicles partly because the Environmental Protection Agency offered them credits in their Corporate Average Fuel Economy calculations for doing so. Since the most recent leap in gasoline prices after the hurricane season, Ford and others have been promoting ethanol as a tool for saving money and reducing dependence on imported oil.</p>
1722019>F.A.A. Calls for Mediation In Talks With Controllers Seeking concessions like those that airlines got from pilots, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration called Monday for mediation in talks with unionized air traffic controllers, saying contract discussions were near an impasse. The controllers&#39; union responded by saying good progress was being made, and charged that the agency was trying to throw the task of resolving the differences to a Republican-controlled Congress unfriendly to organized labor.  <p>The agency&#39;s administrator, Marion C. Blakey, said at a news conference that the union was calling for pay increases of 5.6 percent a year for five years, a proposal that Ms. Blakey said was out of touch with &#39;&#39;the hard reality of an industry that&#39;s in real financial trouble.&#39;&#39; She said her agency, whose biggest revenue source is a tax on plane tickets, was proposing a five-year pay freeze.</p> <p>The controllers said they would be happy to continue the current pattern of pay increases, which is less favorable than what other federal employees get. They also said the agency was actually seeking to cut wages 30 percent, by reclassifying workers.</p> <p>The union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, is the successor to the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, whose strike in 1981 brought mass firing of controllers by President Ronald Reagan. A strike now does not seem likely, but experts say something as simple as controllers&#39; strict adherence to air traffic rules could create heavy travel delays.</p> <p>The union was a prominent backer of Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, in the 2000 presidential election. Ms. Blakey, now in the third year of a five-year term, has said that she would like to put the agency on a more businesslike basis and that the previous administration was far too generous to organized labor. The current contract, which Ms. Blakey says includes provisions that are unaffordable and &#39;&#39;ill advised,&#39;&#39; was signed by her predecessor in 1998, but she agreed in 2003 to extend it for two years. It remains in force until replaced by a new agreement or renounced by either side.</p> <p>The administrator&#39;s assessment Monday that negotiations were near an impasse was particularly significant for procedural reasons. If an impasse in talks is formally declared by either side or by a mediator, federal law provides that the aviation agency can put its proposal before Congress for review. If the lawmakers do not act, the agency can impose the offer it last made to the controllers.</p> <p>Ms. Blakey said that unless her agency cut its labor costs, it could not afford to modernize equipment and employ successors to the wave of controllers who were hired in 1981 and will soon face mandatory retirement.</p> <p>The union and the F.A.A. disagree about how much controllers are paid, and how much the 1998 contract raised their compensation. Russell G. Chew, chief operations officer of the agency&#39;s Air Traffic Organization, said base salary plus overtime, along with premiums like extra pay for living in high-cost areas, came to about $128,000 a year. With benefits included, Mr. Chew said, each controller costs the agency roughly $166,000. Further, the agency said, controllers, who must retire at 59, get more generous pension benefits than other federal workers.</p> <p>Ms. Blakey said that the 1998 contract had raised pay by 74 percent and that because of overtime -- which the agency says in some cases has been abused -- 1,300 of the nation&#39;s 15,000 controllers earn more than $200,000 a year each. Allowing controllers to retain the 74 percent, as the agency would permit, is &#39;&#39;more than fair,&#39;&#39; she said.</p> <p>But Ruth Marlin, executive vice president of the union, said the F.A.A. had told the controllers&#39; negotiators that the average pay was under $110,000. Asked if raises from the 1998 contract came to 74 percent, Ms. Marlin said, &#39;&#39;Don&#39;t I wish.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The union, she said, is proposing that controllers continue to receive the cost-of-living increases that all federal employees get, plus &#39;&#39;step&#39;&#39; increases -- the raises that federal employees get for longevity -- on the same basis as at present, with half given automatically and half dependent on meeting productivity and safety goals.</p> <p>Ms. Blakey was asked at her news conference whether the agency would freeze or even cut its managers&#39; pay, as some airline managements volunteered to do in asking their employees for concessions. She replied that the agency had taken various steps to cut costs and that pay of upper-level managers was set by federal law.</p> <p>Her own pay is capped at $162,000 a year, a spokesman said.</p> <p>Correction:  December 8, 2005, Thursday  An article on Nov. 29 about contract negotiations between the Federal Aviation Administration and the air traffic controllers union misstated the standard retirement age for controllers. It is 56, not 59.</p>
1753369>Air Controller Contract Talks Reach Impasse The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that it had formally reached an impasse in its contract negotiations with the union representing 15,000 air traffic controllers, mostly over proposed cuts in compensation the agency was seeking. A strike is unlikely, both sides said.  <p>The administrator of the agency, Marion C. Blakey, said that a 1997 law gave Congress 60 days to intervene in the dispute, and that if it did not, the agency could impose its last offer.</p> <p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association wants Congress to enact a law that would submit the dispute to binding arbitration.</p> <p>The president of the union, John S. Carr, said that if the agency&#39;s contract offer was imposed, it would &#39;&#39;create an unbelievable rush for the exits.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In a conference call with reporters, Mr. Carr said 25 percent of the union&#39;s members were eligible to retire immediately. If the agency imposes the contract, he said, workers&#39; pay will be frozen for years to come, but if workers retire, their pensions will increase over time.</p> <p>Ms. Blakey said, in a separate conference call, that controllers&#39; pay was &#39;&#39;excessive&#39;&#39; and unfair to other agency employees, and that the agency could save $1.9 billion over five years with its offer. That, she said, &#39;&#39;allows for the kind of investment we really need for a safer, more modernized air traffic system.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In the 2005 fiscal year, according to the aviation agency, the average controller&#39;s compensation package was almost $166,000, including salary, extra pay for working certain jobs or at certain locations, and benefits.</p> <p>The two sides differed over the effect of their respective contract proposals.</p>
289837>Plutonium Hazard Found at Nuclear Arms Plant Enough plutonium to cause an accidental nuclear reaction escaped unnoticed into an air duct at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant, according to an independent study of the plant released yesterday. The report said such a reaction could have occurred under certain circumstances.  <p>A chain reaction would not cause a bomblike explosion but would generate large amounts of radiation and heat and would scatter plutonium, a highly toxic radioactive metal. The report said such an accident was &#39;&#39;a real possiblity&#39;&#39; at Rocky Flats.</p> <p>The study said the presence of plutonium in ventilation ducts, which apparently seeped through air filters over an extended period, demonstrated complacency about safety among workers and managers at the plant, on the outskirts of Denver. Personnel showed &#39;&#39;an absence of healthy inquisitiveness into safety matters,&#39;&#39; the study said, by failing to regard the loss of plutonium as creating the threat of a lethal reaction. No Evidence of Reaction</p> <p>The study was conducted from July to September by Scientech Inc., of Idaho Falls, which was hired by the Department of Energy. The team said it had received a large number of anonymous tips from workers who were &#39;&#39;apparently afraid to raise their concerns to their own supervisors.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But the study said there was no evidence that the plant had ever sustained such an accidental reaction, although, it added, direct evidence of a small reaction would be difficult to find.</p> <p>Such a reaction happens if a critical mass of nuclear material is brought together, allowing atoms of plutonium to split, giving off sub-atomic particles called neutrons that then split additional atoms, creating large amounts of heat and radiation.</p> <p>In a nuclear bomb, the chain reaction expands rapidly, but in an inadvertent reaction, the force of the atoms splitting quickly blows apart the critical mass of plutonium, limiting the amount that is split. In such cases, however, large quantities of radiation are released along with the plutonium itself, a highly dangerous contaminant.</p> <p>An accidental reaction would probably not result in a release outside the plant buildings, the study said. Other Department of Energy plants around the country have had such &#39;&#39;criticalities,&#39;&#39; and since 1962, the Rocky Flats Plant has had &#39;&#39;about eight&#39;&#39; serious infractions of the procedures designed to prevent criticalities, the study said, involving &#39;&#39;kilogram quantities&#39;&#39; of plutonium. The plant uses plutonium to make triggers for hydrogen bombs, which release their energy by fusing atoms, rather than splitting them.</p> <p>For a criticality to have occurred in the duct at the plant would require a &#39;&#39;reflector&#39;&#39; to concentrate neutrons, the study said. Water or a human body could act as that reflector, according to the study. &#39;Working on Removal&#39;</p> <p>But Leo Duffy, the Secretary of Energy&#39;s assistant for coordination of environmental restoration and waste management, said the plutonium was not concentrated in a shape that could sustain a chain reaction. Instead, he said, it was spread out, in some places over distances of 50 feet. &#39;&#39;It cannot go critical in the condition it is in now,&#39;&#39; he said, adding, &#39;&#39;we&#39;re working on removal operations.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In addition, he said, a careful analysis after the department received the report showed that the plutonium concentrations were lower than what had initially been estimated.</p> <p>But the discovery of any plutonium at all contradicts previous assertions, the consultants said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Previous to this study, plant managers had insisted that this type of plutonium holdup (accumulation) was not happening at the plant, even though exhaust ducts had been specifically suggested by a former employee and ventilation system designer,&#39;&#39; said the study.</p> <p>W. Henson Moore, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, said in a telephone interview: &#39;&#39;You can view it as good news or bad news. The good news for us is that we found it.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The major thrust of the report, he said, was that there was no evidence that an accidental reaction had ever occurred. Legislator&#39;s Reaction</p> <p>Representative David E. Skaggs, a Colorado Democrat whose district includes the plant, said in a statement yesterday that he was grateful that the Energy Secretary, James D. Watkins, had ordered the study and another released on Thursday that detailed extensive environmental violations. But he said, &#39;&#39;This is at least the seventh report I&#39;ve received from D.O.E. in the last three years that says Rocky Flats suffers from lax safety attitudes and poor operating and management practices - and that also admits things aren&#39;t improving. We&#39;ve gotten plenty of reports but far too little action in implementing them.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Duffy, in response, said, &#39;&#39;There&#39;s not much we can say about past history except that we&#39;re working on correcting it.&#39;&#39; He noted that Mr. Watkins came to the department 7 months ago.</p> <p>In addition, the department is in the process of replacing the contractor that runs Rocky Flats, Rockwell International Inc. Ed Heintz, a company spokesman, said Rockwell had no comment on the report.</p>
529317>He Doesn&#39;t Call Them Dirty Deals Many entrepreneurs have tried to pull off emissions-trading deals under the acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990. Apparently the first to be successful, with the agreement between the Tennessee Valley Authority and Wisconsin Power and Light, is a small Washington-based investment banking firm, Clean Air Capital Markets, established by John B. Henry 2d shortly after passage of the act. Mr. Henry, 43 years old, said in a telephone interview that his approach was different from many competitors, who were acting as consultants. He is an investment banker, paid only if a deal is signed. He did not disclose the fee for the T.V.A.-Wisconsin deal, but said he and his partners had spent more than $1 million &quot;establishing the franchise,&quot; or setting themselves up to arrange such deals.  <p>The size of the potential market is huge; by Mr. Henry&#39;s calculation, if all the emission reductions were achieved by trades -- which is unlikely -- the value would equal one-third the capitalization of all the companies on the American Stock Exchange. &quot;We&#39;re not shooting mice here,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s an elephant hunt.&quot; Making Them Cringe</p> <p>Mr. Henry and others in the field cringe at the idea that utilities are buying the right to pollute. &quot;Utilities are buying clean air,&quot; he said. No utility would rely exclusively on allowance purchases, rather than cleaning itself up, he said; for one thing, that would be politically impossible.</p> <p>But if buying allowances is cheaper than cutting emissions, then utilities should buy, to help hold their rates down, he said. Electric rates increased by environmental requirements are like a regressive tax, Mr. Henry believes, falling more heavily on the poor.</p> <p>A second such deal was announced yesterday by Wisconsin Power; the company said that in addition to T.V.A., it was also selling allowances to the Duquesne Light Company, with headquarters in Pittsburgh. Mr. Henry was not involved in that deal.</p> <p>Mr. Henry, a graduate of Columbia Law School, describes Clean Air Capital Markets as his second environmental company. From 1981 to 1990 he was chief executive of Crop Genetics International, an agricultural biotechnology company traded over-the-counter.</p> <p>Clean Air Capital Markets&#39; vice president is Ernest G. Ellingson, formerly in charge of strategic planning at Georgia Power. The company&#39;s lawyer is Andrew D. Weissman, who specializes in air pollution law.</p> <p>While economists have hailed the emissions trading concept, utilities, which are inherently conservative, have been slow to warm to the concept. &quot;They have an extraordinary bias to on-system compliance, cleaning up your own system,&quot; he said. One reason, he said, is that each utility has a fuel department, which would handle the arrangements if the company chose fuel-switching, an engineering staff that would negotiate with companies that install scrubbers or other pollution control equipment.  But, he said, &quot;generally there are no constituents inside for buying compliance outside your own system.&quot;</p> <p>But buying allowances is the most conservative option, he argued. &quot;What a scrubber really is, is a decision to buy a 30-year stream of allowances,&quot; he said, meaning that the scrubber would generate emission reductions for that long. But if the scrubber went into service in 1995 and ran until 2025, he said, that committed the utility to that option for all those years. If the price of allowances declines in future years, he said, the scrubber would look like a bad buy.</p> <p>COMPANY NEWS</p>
231822>Why Americans Consume More Energy to Produce Less TWELVE years after President Carter declared &#39;&#39;the moral equivalent of war&#39;&#39; against the waste of dwindling supplies of energy, the United States appears to have won a few battles and forgotten the war.  <p>When Mr. Carter made his speech in April 1977, oil imports were at the alarming level of 8.5 million barrels a day, and he said they should be cut to fewer than 6 million. By 1981 imports had fallen to that level, and as recently as 1985 the number was a mere 4.9 million barrels a day. Now the level is back up to 8 million barrels a day and climbing, and the country is importing more electricity and natural gas, too.</p> <p>Progress in reducing energy consumption has stalled as well. Starting in 1973, the United States increased production of goods and services without increasing energy consumption by using the energy more efficiently. But lately energy consumption has been rising faster than production. And in the amount produced for every barrel of oil or ton of coal consumed, the United States is still well behind Japan and Western Europe.</p> <p>The reasons why the drive for more efficient energy use has lost steam, economists say, are part price, part policy and part public psychology. Cars, for example, show all three elements. With cheaper gasoline and fading memories of shortages, Americans are buying bigger cars. In addition, the Reagan Administration froze the fuel-mileage standards. The Federal Government prints a book listing gas mileage on all car models, but last year it cut the press run by 70 percent, leaving consumers to gather the knowledge on their own.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s the telepathic theory of market information,&#39;&#39; said Amory B. Lovins, a conservation expert. He said that during the Reagan years the Department of Energy cut spending for improving energy efficiency through research, development and promotion by 71 percent. Supply and Demand</p> <p>While the Government has intervened in the marketplace to insure adequate fuel supplies, it has seldom done much to encourage widespread conservation, said another expert, Arthur H. Rosenfeld, a physicist and director of the Center for Building Sciences at the University of California at Berkeley.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We have this unfortunate tradition,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;The Government takes some hand in the supply side, even to subsidize it, because it has something to do with the balance of trade.&#39;&#39; More oil wells or more nuclear reactors mean fewer imports, the policy-makers realize, and less vulnerability in time of war. But cutting imports by reducing consumption - insulation in the attic and better engines in cars - is regarded as a matter of free choice for individuals.</p> <p>While oil companies and electric utilities will make investments to improve supplies that will not pay for themselves for 10 years or more, most energy consumers will make improvements only if the payback is two or three years. &#39;&#39;Then we wonder why we spend twice as much of gross national product on energy as other people do,&#39;&#39; Mr. Rosenfeld said.</p> <p>The relatively high national energy bills are a drag on the economy. Japan uses half as much energy for each $1,000 in goods and services produced as the United States does, and West Germany uses just over half as much. Both those countries have something to teach the United States, said Dr. Lee Schipper, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California, but the lesson takes some sorting out. Japan and West Germany heat only about half as much house per capita as the United States does, he said. And to refer to &#39;&#39;home heating&#39;&#39; in Japan is an exaggeration by American standards; typically, houses are kept at 60 degrees.</p> <p>Refrigerators are the biggest single energy user in most American homes. The average new refrigerator here uses 1,200 kilowatt-hours a year, while the average new Japanese model uses 500 kilowatt-hours. According to Dr. Schipper, half the difference is because Japanese refrigerators are smaller.</p> <p>The other half is because they are better built. Still, he said, even Japan seems to be losing interest in energy conservation, for many of the same reasons as the United States has.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Good engineers who were thinking of ways to reduce energy use are now thinking of new colors to paint refrigerators,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Much could be done, however, especially in the area of improving electrical efficiency. In Maine, for example, utility regulators recently rejected a 29-year, $4 billion contract to import electricity from Canada, saying that Central Maine Power had not fully explored other alternatives, such as improving efficiency and buying from independent producers that generate electricity by burning waste products.</p> <p>Central Maine Power is embarking on a variety of conservation programs. Every year, for example, the Lions Clubs in Maine sell lightbulbs to raise money for charity. Last year, the utility gave the club 246,000 high-efficiency bulbs, which members sold for $5 a sixpack. When they are in use, according to Central Maine, customers will save money on monthly power bills, and the utility will save 11 megawatts of power, reducing the utility&#39;s costs by more than it paid for the bulbs.</p> <p>IDEAS &amp; TRENDS</p>
1376162>Jet Like One in Queens Crash Shows Sign of Damage to Tail Investigators looking into the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in Queens last Nov. 12 said today that they had discovered &#39;&#39;indications of damage&#39;&#39; in the tail of another plane of the same model -- an Airbus A300 -- that was involved in an in-flight accident near West Palm Beach, Fla., five years ago. The tail is of special interest because in the Queens crash, the plane swiveled radically from side to side and the vertical portion of the tail fell off shortly after takeoff from Kennedy International Airport.  <p>The West Palm Beach incident occurred on May 12, 1997, and the safety board blamed it on the crew&#39;s failure to maintain adequate airspeed. That Airbus A300 went into a severe bank, and then a series of oscillations for about 34 seconds, according to the board, dropping to 13,000 feet from 16,000 feet. A passenger was seriously injured and a flight attendant was slightly injured, according to a board report.</p> <p>A visual inspection of the plane after the incident found no damage, and it has been in regular service ever since.</p> <p>Airbus A300&#39;s have tails made of composite materials, which has raised the suspicions of investigators, although so far they have not determined whether the materials played any role in the incidents. Composite parts must meet the same strength specifications as aluminum ones.</p> <p>The Federal Aviation Administration said that it would probably order the tails taken off some other Airbus A300&#39;s for inspections. The agency order will cover other A300&#39;s that have faced unusual stresses, said Alison Duquette, a spokeswoman. The agency could not say this afternoon how many that would be; industry experts speculated that it would be a small number. American, which has 34 of the aircraft, said it would comply.</p> <p>An ultrasonic inspection of the plane in the Florida accident, which was carried out after the Queens crash, found &#39;&#39;an indication of damage (possible delamination),&#39;&#39; according to the board. Delamination is when the layers of the composite separate. The damage was in the area where the vertical fin connects to the fuselage, which is the place where the tail of American 587 tore off the plane before the Queens crash, which killed all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.</p> <p>Airbus said in a statement said the plane in the Florida accident showed damage to one of the six attachment points, but noted that the airplane was certified as safe to fly even with one attachment point completely disconnected.</p> <p>The Safety Board did not characterize the significance of the discovery. Airbus, the manufacturer, said it was good news, because the damage was small even though the plane had sustained greater lateral forces than it was designed for. The tail could have safely continued in service indefinitely, the manufacturer said, but it will now be replaced.</p> <p>David Venz, a spokesman for Airbus, said that the small amount of damage found was &#39;&#39;a testimony to the strength that&#39;s built into the design, to carry the loads exerted on that airplane.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>After the Queens crash, the F.A.A. ordered a visual inspection of Airbus A300&#39;s. Advocates of composites say that any internal damage severe enough to cause a problem would be visible from the outside. Ultrasonic inspection is not generally performed on aircraft in service.</p> <p>Of United States carriers, only American uses the A300 in passenger service. Federal Express and United Parcel Service also fly the plane.</p>
165128>Oil: Putting the Pieces Together WILL the price of oil rise in the next few months or fall? Probably both, sharply, and several times, if the recent past is any guide.  <p>Oil markets were shaken last week by the apparent readiness of Iran and Iraq to cease hostilities. That could sharply decrease the divisiveness within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which would permit production cuts and thus, price rises.</p> <p>As measured by prices in the futures markets, that school of thought is now dominant. But some traders and other experts think that the result will be the opposite - that an end to hostilities would unleash a flood of oil on world markets as the military threat to oil tankers is removed and as Iran and Iraq raise production to finance postwar reconstruction. Any increase in supplies would depress prices.</p> <p>Whether prices rise or fall, the energy situation poses challenges for the industry and for whoever moves into the White House in January.</p> <p>The United States has a big oil deficit; it consumes lots of oil but produces only a little more than half of it, and production is likely to shrink further in years to come, according to the Department of Energy and the oil industry. A decline in domestic drilling, experts say, leads to higher spending for imports.</p> <p>OPEC, meanwhile, has lost - at least temporarily - the clout it wielded in the 1970&#39;s, when it engineered short-term interruptions that sharply increased oil prices.</p> <p>Currently, the Persian Gulf countries supply 18.2 percent of imports to the United States. Another 40 percent, however, comes from closer, friendlier sources: Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. And Canada&#39;s reserves now appear to be even more accessible to the United States because of the Free Trade Agreement that is before legislators in Washington and Ottawa.</p> <p>But if demand increases, spare capacity would have to be put into service, and most of that is in the Persian Gulf, giving that region the &#39;&#39;swing vote&#39;&#39; in the market place. Because the Middle East still has most of the world&#39;s oil, it will be the key factor in the energy markets for as long as oil dominates the United States&#39; energy needs.</p> <p>In the long term, the level of imports depends largely on price. If world oil prices stay low, the decline of production in this country will accelerate, according to experts. Drilling companies believe that in the current soft market most locations where oil can be profitably drilled lie abroad.</p> <p>A corollary is that lower prices make American wells uncompetitive. They also encourage consumption. That combination can produce higher imports - and, with them, a higher import bill.</p> <p>But if prices get too high, demand will fall. In that case, America can do more with less oil, and more with other forms of energy, like natural gas, coal and nuclear power. For example, cars could run on natural gas, on liquids made from coal or on electricity made from coal or uranium. There is also substitution: fiberglass in attics and caulk around windows saved gallons of oil or therms of gas. Indeed, substitutes for oil may become more prevalent, regardless of price, if the greenhouse effect induces conservation on environmental grounds.</p> <p>Substitution is reassuring for the economy as a whole, but not for the oil sector, which is now in the midst of a contraction.</p> <p>And that poses new questions for policy makers. As Gov. John H. Sununu of New Hampshire told energy company executives in Washington recently, &#39;&#39;This country does not know today whether it wants high oil prices and a strong domestic industry, or low prices and no domestic industry.&#39;&#39;</p>
1741488>A Shift Based on Science and Politics As a naval officer, Jimmy Carter helped design nuclear reactors for submarines. But as president, Mr. Carter banned the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel to extract material that would be useful in reactors and bombs. Thirty years later, President Bush has proposed a new version of reprocessing. The reversal can be traced mainly to uneven progress in technology over the last three decades, and to a lesser extent to political and economic factors.  <p>Today, it is much less expensive to manufacture uranium for nuclear weapons, reducing the likelihood that a country with weapons ambitions would reprocess spent fuel for that purpose. And the failure to find an acceptable way to dispose of the fuel after use -- including burying it -- has made reprocessing look better by comparison.</p> <p>Recently the Energy Department admitted that it no longer had any schedule or cost estimate for the planned spent-fuel repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, and that without reprocessing, it would soon have to find a second repository site.</p> <p>In one way, it seems counterintuitive that the United States is considering reprocessing now, when the number of reactors has been growing slowly, compared with the Carter era, when experts expected hundreds of reactors to be built. Back then, uranium was expensive and thought to be scarce, and demand was growing. Mr. Carter&#39;s suspension precluded the production of potentially cheaper fuel.</p> <p>On the other hand, by reintroducing reprocessing, President Bush is trying to develop a different source of fuel for reactors when the uranium they use is plentiful.</p> <p>Nuclear advocates say, though, that hundreds of new reactors will eventually be built, and that there is no reason to deny the world the value of resources that are locked in spent fuel for fear of weapons proliferation, since reprocessed fuel is no longer the easiest route to a bomb.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;A key part of the logic behind the U.S. decision to forgo reprocessing is now perversely incorrect,&#39;&#39; said Per F. Peterson, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of California, Berkeley.</p> <p>It is still possible to make a bomb from reprocessed material from civilian power plants -- the United States did it on an experimental basis decades ago. But as the current argument with Iran shows, the preferred route is to make bomb material from virgin uranium, because the technology that enriches the uranium for use in a bomb has advanced so much faster than the technology for disposing of spent fuel.</p> <p>There are other reasons for the shift, too, including ideology. President Carter, who had been an engineering officer in Adm. Hyman G. Rickover&#39;s nuclear submarine program, had a decidedly modest view of what nuclear technology could accomplish. But President Bush&#39;s approach to energy, ranging from fuel cells to ethanol to a new generation of nuclear reactors and reprocessing factories, is highly optimistic.</p> <p>The energy secretary, Samuel W. Bodman, told a Senate committee last week that the administration&#39;s solution to energy problems was &#39;&#39;transformational technologies.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>There are also political problems that favor radical approaches like a new reprocessing plan. While the Bush administration has slogged toward preparing to ask for a license to open a waste repository at Yucca Mountain, the 20-year-old law under which it is looking to open a site has a far more onerous task.</p> <p>The administration will soon be required to tell Congress what it is doing about finding a site for the next repository, which must go in the eastern United States. If there is no other solution, like reprocessing, the administration could find itself at the beginning of the next presidential primary season scouting out the granite formations of New Hampshire as waste burial sites. (The Energy Department actually looked there in the 1980&#39;s.)</p> <p>Hence the move to the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, announced as part of the administration&#39;s budget. Under the program, countries that already have enrichment technology would lease reactor fuel to countries that lack production means. The producing country would take back the fuel after it was used.</p> <p>This would mean that countries like Iran could have reactors without fuel technology. Countries that already have nuclear weapons or, like Japan, do not want them would reuse the plutonium and other nuclear fuels for civilian purposes and reduce the volume of waste.</p> <p>That is not to say the plan is feasible. Turning ideas about nuclear physics into commercially viable technology is notoriously difficult.</p> <p>When the Bush budget was released, Clay Sell, the deputy energy secretary, was asked what price uranium would have to reach before a recycled product could compete. He had no answer except to say that the value of reducing the waste&#39;s volume and toxicity should be figured in.</p> <p>The commercial industry applauds the Bush administration&#39;s support for new reactors that are modifications of the current designs, but is silent on new reprocessing plants and a new generation of reactors that would use reprocessed material. Congress has not embraced reprocessing, either.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If the raw material is still cheaper, nobody buys the recycled product,&#39;&#39; said a federal energy official, who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to hurt his ties with the White House. &#39;&#39;Why would you want to pay more for fuel?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The global partnership, the official said, is not impossible, but &#39;&#39;it&#39;s not something that is going to be driven by the industry.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>It is also opposed by some experts in nuclear proliferation, who say America&#39;s 30-year pledge not to take bomb-usable plutonium out of spent fuel has made it harder for other countries to do that.</p> <p>But the plan still appeals to people who put faith in technology. Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico and chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, spoke warmly of the idea. He said it would help the United States regain leadership in the nuclear field.</p> <p>President Carter, he said, had stopped reprocessing on the theory that others would follow, but Britain and France still reprocess, and Japan wants to. &#39;&#39;We stopped, and the world didn&#39;t,&#39;&#39; Mr. Domenici said.</p>
1822249>Urging Teenagers to Rein In Careless Drivers DRIVING with passengers is generally safer than driving alone, at least for adults, studies have found. But if the driver and passengers are teenagers, the risk of a fatal crash rises. Add more teenagers and the risk goes up more. Highway safety specialists are trying to change that with a series of public service television ads, starting today, intended to persuade teenagers that it is O.K. to complain if the driver is going too fast or being too wild.  <p>&#39;&#39;Most teens are wary of expressing their discomfort, for fear of seeming uncool,&#39;&#39; said Joe DePreta, partner and executive managing director of North Castle, an agency in Stamford, Conn., that produced the spots for the Ad Council. His firm has done previous campaigns for products used by young people, including apparel, acne cream and snack foods, and also produces ads aimed at motivating teenagers to study math and science.</p> <p>Young people, Mr. DePreta said, are &#39;&#39;concerned about being confrontational or insulting.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They certainly don&#39;t want to be labeled the mom, or put a bad vibe on the dynamic,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Paradoxically, he said, teenagers are far quicker to accept guidance from peers than from older people.</p> <p>Social reluctance to raise a safety issue is not limited to cars. Airlines spend hours training their captains and co-pilots to backstop each other in formal training called cockpit resource management. Still, studies show that captains are more assertive in challenging co-pilots than vice versa, because of what specialists call an authority gradient, in which an underling hesitates to criticize a supervisor.</p> <p>Studies show that teenage drivers are at higher risk of being in fatal accidents to start with, and that risk goes up as the number of passengers rises. A study by David F. Preusser, Susan A. Ferguson and Allan F. Williams, published in 1998 in the journal Accident Analysis and Prevention, found that 16-year-old drivers who were alone in a car were slightly more than twice as likely to have a fatal crash as middle-aged drivers. But if there were passengers, they were nearly five times as likely to have a fatal crash.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Teens like to have a moving party in the car,&#39;&#39; said Penny Wells, president and executive director of SADD, which was also involved in developing the new campaign. The organization was founded as Students Against Drunk Driving but is now known as Students Against Destructive Decisions. She said seeing ads that encourage teenagers to speak up would help them envision themselves intervening.</p> <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has advised states to limit the number of passengers that young novice drivers can carry. Many states have done so, using a graduated license system in which limitations are imposed on rookie drivers, who gain privileges with experience. Still, many crashes occur when young people have full licenses.</p> <p>Mark V. Rosenker, the board chairman, said it was &#39;&#39;gratifying to see this approach to promote responsible decision making by both young drivers and their passengers.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Safety specialists have tried before to encourage positive peer pressure, with campaigns like &#39;&#39;Friends don&#39;t let friends drive drunk.&#39;&#39; Some of those are explicitly aimed at teenagers.</p> <p>Philip W. Haseltine, president of the Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety, which is financed by carmakers and related companies, said that teenagers&#39; attitudes could be changed, but not by ads alone.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It might be a good starting point,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;That message is going to have to be reinforced on multiple occasions, from multiple sources, if we expect it to have any effectiveness.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In one of the ads, two young men in the front seats are bantering as the car careers down a dark road; in the back is a third young man, looking nervous. The driver takes his eyes off the road to hunt on the car floor for the cellphone he has dropped. Suddenly, a slightly older man in a coat and tie steps into the back seat and begins a sales pitch, in tones like the one used on late-night TV for wonder products not available in stores.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;How would you like to save your life from an ugly reckless-driving death?&#39;&#39; he asks.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Don&#39;t answer yet, there&#39;s more,&#39;&#39; he continues. &#39;&#39;Act now, by slowing down, and we&#39;ll guarantee you complete satisfaction.&#39;&#39; He gives a toothy grin.</p> <p>A sober-voiced narrator says, &#39;&#39;In the real world, there is no spokesperson to prevent reckless driving, there&#39;s only you. Speak up.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In a second ad, three young women are in a car. As the front-seat passenger waves and calls enthusiastically to someone on the sidewalk, the driver sinks down beneath the dashboard to avoid being seen. The third young woman, sitting in back, looks terrified. The same salesman appears.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Do you have a problem with your friends driving recklessly?&#39;&#39; he asks. &#39;&#39;With your friends endangering your life? I&#39;m here to tell you that reckless driving is the No. 1 cause of teenage deaths. But with new and improved Slow Down, you don&#39;t have to die.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>His delivery is a parody of salesmanship, making &#39;&#39;slow down&#39;&#39; sound like the bonus provided free for ordering a ginsu knife now.</p> <p>In the end, the young woman in back says to the driver, &#39;&#39;Kim, pay attention!&#39;&#39;</p> <p>And a radio spot mockingly offers a new product, &#39;&#39;Car Windshield.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It slices, it dices, with razorlike edges that never need sharpening,&#39;&#39; says a hyped-up announcer. And all you need to do to experience it, he says, is to say nothing when the person behind the wheel is driving recklessly.</p> <p>Yet another ad says, &#39;&#39;Interstate Highway Ditch can be yours.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING</p>
297810>New England Electric Drops Bid for Utility Outbid by two rivals, the New England Electric System formally withdrew its $2 billion bid yesterday for the assets of the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, which is under bankruptcy protection.  <p>The move leaves two Connecticut utilities in the running, Northeast Utilities, Hartford, and the United Illuminating Company, New Haven.</p> <p>New England Electric, based in Westborough, Mass., said that continuing its bid &#39;&#39;would not be in the best interests of our customers and shareholders.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>United Illuminating has made a bid that it values at $2.29 billion, and Northeast puts its bid at $2.25 billion. Unsecured creditors favor the United Illuminating bid, while equity holders have endorsed Northeast&#39;s.</p> <p>Wilbur Ross, a director of Rothschild Inc. and an adviser to the equity committee, said that New England Electric&#39;s withdrawal had substantially simplified the bidding, because Northeast and United Illuminating have proposed similar rate increases, while New England Electric&#39;s was lower.</p> <p>With only two companies remaining, he said, the proposals would be easier for the New Hampshire Legislature, Governor and Attorney General to sort out.</p> <p>A lawyer representing unsecured creditors, Geoffrey Kalmus, said, &#39;&#39;We&#39;re disappointed that they&#39;ve dropped out, but we have two bidders who are both very good competitors, very interested in buying this enterprise.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Among issues to be decided is how to treat the Seabrook nuclear power plant. The companies&#39; bids vary in value depending on whether the plant eventually operates.</p> <p>Public Service owns the largest share of Seabrook, 35.6 percent, and it was driven into bankruptcy by its inability to put the reactor into commercial service. Public Service&#39;s management has a proposal to end the bankruptcy but that proposal has had no outside support.</p> <p>COMPANY NEWS</p>
533141>What About Oil?; The Gulf War Put the Focus on Supplies, But a New Energy Bill Skips That Issue Sixteen months after the nation went to war over oil in the Persian Gulf, an energy bill is taking final shape in Washington, yet the focus is everywhere but on oil. Two similar versions, one passed by the House Wednesday and the other by the Senate in February, do, however, include a variety of significant measures, most importantly affecting electric utilities. Those changes would increase efficiency in lights, appliances and motors, improve the natural gas supply for utilities and other customers, and, possibly, remove one of many stumbling blocks to building nuclear plants.  <p>&quot;I would call it a positive first step on the way to something we don&#39;t ever seem to achieve, which is a comprehensive national energy policy,&quot; said Wilfrid L. Kohl, director of the international energy program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. That, he said, would require a stiff gasoline tax.</p> <p>Such a tax was not seriously discussed in Washington, but with the United States now importing about half its crude oil and destined to import more in the future, and with the economy resonating with every big oil-price movement, there was no shortage of proposals to cut the nation&#39;s consumption or increase its supply.</p> <p>Congress seriously considered drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, requiring more fuel efficiency in cars and rapidly filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But in the end, the House or Senate rejected all three.</p> <p>This was probably essential to the energy bill&#39;s survival, because opponents of either Arctic drilling or stricter gas-mileage requirements could probably have sunk the package; certainly they could have done so together.  A Lack of Will</p> <p>&quot;The most potentially valuable provisions were the most controversial, and there wasn&#39;t the will to tackle them,&quot; said Eli Bergman, director of Americans for Energy Independence, a Washington-based interest group.</p> <p>&quot;Senators and Congressmen will whisper that the thing that would do the most would be a $1 hike in the gasoline tax,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;ll whisper it, but they won&#39;t do anything about it.&quot; In fact, last fall Congress choked on adding a nickel.</p> <p>The result is an energy bill pushed into the public eye by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but which, paradoxically, is hardly relevant to the oil-related aspects of the war. The notable exception -- extending for 10 years some bans on offshore drilling -- is a negative for the industry.</p> <p>&quot;At least,&quot; mused Lawrence J. Goldstein, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, &quot;they were smart enough to realize they&#39;ve done nothing to deal with U.S. security.&quot; A Two-Year History</p> <p>The bill, now the National Energy Strategy, began life two years ago as the National Energy Security Act, intended to reduce the impact of oil shocks, Mr. Goldstein pointed out. But reaching political consensus on oil in a nation so divided between the interests of producers and consumers will evidently require a bigger oil crisis or a bloodier war.</p> <p>The bill&#39;s most important provision is, for the public, obscure and barely comprehensible: revising a 50-year-old law on electric company monopolies. The change might cut electricity bills in the future, but the case is far from clear-cut. It will probably create a bigger cast of characters in the business of building generating stations, but much will depend on the outcome of the House-Senate conference on the bill, because the two houses set different terms for those generators to have access to utility-owned transmission lines.</p> <p>The House bill&#39;s second-most important provision will aid in raising the efficiency of electric lights, motors and appliances. But in this role the Federal Government is merely helping along what the states and utilities are doing already.</p> <p>The bill may not really deserve the title &quot;strategy,&quot; but there are a wide variety of provisions. One would provide $927 million between now and 1996 for conservation and development of renewable energy sources.</p> <p>But more than half of that &quot;expenditure&quot; is a Federal agreement not to jeopardize existing state conservation programs. At the urging of the states, utilities are making cash grants to electricity consumers to buy more efficient equipment, and Washington has been threatening to tax those grants, in effect putting a brake on the states&#39; conservation programs. The House bill makes utility grants to residential customers tax-free, along with two-thirds of the grants to industries and businesses.  Billions for Renewables</p> <p>The rest of the money would be used to encourage production of electricity from the sun, the wind, crop wastes and the heat of the earth&#39;s core. In contrast, more than $800 million was given to independent oil producers, in the form of tax exemptions from the Alternative Minimum Tax provisions of the Federal tax code.</p> <p>The bill authorizes billions of dollars for research and development, into coal, nuclear power and renewable fuels. The slice for renewables is larger than approved in recent years, but environmentalists say they are waiting to see how much is appropriated.</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s O.K. as far as it goes,&quot; Mr. Bergman said. &quot;It&#39;s almost incredible that we even get an energy bill this year, when the price of gasoline is at historic lows and the country has a hell of a lot of other problems.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Bergman&#39;s group was perhaps the only one to favor both drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and an increase in automobile fuel efficiency, alternatives that were initially put forward as tacitly balanced, with at least a third of the Congress vehemently opposed to one or the other.</p> <p>At the Sierra Club, which feels good about the outcome in the Arctic and bereft over the failure to require higher-mileage cars, Daniel F. Becker, a lobbyist, said, &quot;We&#39;re calling it half a good energy package.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s marginally better than nothing,&quot; said Mr. Goldstein of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.</p> <p>Representative Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, said that while oil companies should have been forced to pay for the expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, he supported the bill for its many other provisions.</p> <p>&quot;Any way you slice it, this bill helps our nation reduce its dependence on foreign oil,&quot; he said, pointing specifically to the sections on conservation and electric utilities.</p> <p>But the United States is not without an energy policy. The leading Federal component, according to oil experts and environmentalists, is disguised as the Clean Air Act of 1990, which encourages the use of methanol, natural gas and electricity to run cars. Influence of California</p> <p>Perhaps more significant is the California Air Resources Board, whose regulations on cars appear likely to be adopted in several large Northeastern states, perhaps almost all of them. Those regulations appear to require huge numbers of electric vehicles, along with others running on methanol and natural gas.</p> <p>There are other components of the energy bill that appear likely to have a long-term impact, although not on oil. Almost no one is happy with the present system for deciding whether natural gas pipelines should be built, and the energy bill would make it easier to win approval. The electric efficiency provisions will also probably increase the average efficiency of refrigerators, lights and similar devices in years to come.</p> <p>There is also a wild card: a change in the rules for licensing nuclear power plants. The change has no immediate importance, but reduces one of the many obstacles to a revival of that industry.</p>
1798585>A Power-Grid Report Suggests Some Dark Days Ahead Companies are not building power plants and power lines fast enough to meet growing demand, according to a group recently assigned by the federal government to assure proper operation of the power grid. The group, the North American Electric Reliability Council, in its annual report, to be released Monday, said the amount of power that could be generated or transmitted would drop below the target levels meant to ensure reliability on peak days in Texas, New England, the Mid-Atlantic area and the Midwest during the next two to three years.  <p>The council was established in 1965 after a blackout across the Northeast, and has since set voluntary standards for the industry. After the blackout of 2003, which covered a vast swath of the Midwest, Northeast and Ontario, Congress set up a process that would eventually give the council the authority to fine American companies that did not follow certain operating standards. It is seeking a similar designation in Canada, since -- electrically speaking -- the border is irrelevant.</p> <p>For years, the council has produced often-gloomy annual reports, but this is the first to be officially filed with federal agencies, and to recommend specific action.</p> <p>The report says, for example, that utilities should be encouraged to pursue financial incentives for customers to cut use during peak hours, thereby lowering demand for new power plants and transmission lines. Financial incentives could reward customers&#39; installation of more efficient equipment or, more drastically, reward a factory for closing on a day when electricity supplies are expected to be tight.</p> <p>The president of the council, Rick P. Sergel, said in a telephone interview, &#39;&#39;The situation has existed for a long time, but we cannot let it continue.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Planning for adequate capacity has become more difficult with the restructuring of the electric industry. Where a handful of top-to-bottom companies once generated power, transmitted it and delivered it, hundreds of companies are now involved in only one or two phases of the process. At the same time, getting permits to build new power lines has become more difficult.</p> <p>The actual balance between supply and demand depends in part on changes in technology. Grid operators can now push more power through existing lines, plant operators have found ways to make generators more reliable and sharp increases in the efficiency of how electricity is used could slow demand.</p> <p>The report predicts that demand will increase by about 19 percent over the next 10 years in the United States, and slightly less in Canada, and that the construction of power plants and transmission lines to carry that load will fall far short of what is needed. In this country, utilities have contracts with new power plants for only about a third of the capacity that will be needed; in Canada, the number is about two-thirds.</p> <p>The number of miles of transmission lines, which can help redistribute supplies, will increase by only about 7 percent, the report said.</p>
427513>Concerns Are Raised Over the Long-Term Outlook for Oil For oil-importing nations like the United States, the immediate postwar outlook is highly favorable but the long-term picture is far more troubling, according to experts at a conference here on Middle East oil and security. &quot;Prospects are that the oil price will be relatively low, maybe quite low, in the short run,&quot; said Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now a professor of economic policy at Princeton University and chairman of James D. Wolfensohn Inc. But low prices bring rising imports, he said, and imports are growing to a worrisome level.  <p>&quot;It is one thing if our energy imports are going up, in a context of a feeling that eventually it is coming under some kind of control,&quot; Mr. Volcker said, speaking at a conference organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But it would be something else, he said, if imports rose &quot;in what was interpreted as a rather uncontrolled kind of way, surrounded by other policies that are summed up as inflationary and ineffective,&quot; like continued high budget and trade deficits.  Even More Imports</p> <p>The United States imports nearly 50 percent of its oil, and that figure will probably rise to 60 percent or higher by the end of the decade, most industry experts say. By that time, according to some participants, the cost will be more than $200 billion a year.</p> <p>The contrast with the short term is striking. Over all, the United States and other Western economies came through the occupation of Kuwait surprisingly well, according to many participants in the two-day conference, which began today.</p> <p>&quot;This ought to have been the mother of all crises,&quot; said Keith Hamm, managing director of the London-based Petroleum Economics Ltd., a consulting firm. But with a recession and warm weather in some consuming nations, and extra production from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, the crisis was minimized, according to market watchers.  Hands-Off Policy</p> <p>James R. Schlesinger, the former Secretary of Energy and Defense who was chairman of the conference, said a key question for the end of the war was whether the United States, after having come to the defense of Saudi Arabia and other gulf states, would encourage its Arab allies to keep oil prices low. &quot;The keepers of the White House economic gospel feel that any such intervention is improper,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The war has so expanded world oil production that the market may ride out the next big event, the decline of the world&#39;s largest oil producer, the Soviet Union, said Arlon Tussing, an energy consultant and former economist with the Senate Energy Committee. The Soviet Union is on the verge of becoming an importer rather than an exporter because the economic problems of the country have cut its production, some experts said.</p> <p>While oil wells, gathering points and shipping equipment have been damaged in Iraq and Kuwait, Mr. Hamm said, all the other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are producing &quot;flat out&quot; and could continue to meet world demand for years. The other members are collectively planning expansion to 27 million barrels a day of capacity, he said, which would be about 5 million barrels a day above their current level, and that level would suffice until the end of the century.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the postwar direction of American energy policy is highly uncertain, participants said. Mr. Volcker called for a stiff gasoline tax, but others called this unlikely. Richard F. Lawson, president of the National Coal Association and a retired Air Force general, recalled the condolence letters he had written to the mothers of dead servicemen, and said that there was a moral imperative to reduce the importance of imported oil.</p>
239082>Alternative-Fuel Vehicles Move From Fancy to Fact In British Columbia, drivers of about 8,000 vehicles are using natural gas instead of gasoline. To fill up, the drivers pull into one of 50 service stations equipped with natural-gas pumps.  <p>Because the vehicles emit mostly carbon dioxide and water, they are being hailed by environmentalists concerned about air pollution as a good alternative to gasoline-powered cars.</p> <p>The British Columbia experience is the most highly developed example of the use of less-polluting fuels. But other programs -in California, Washington state and New York City - also illustrate how natural gas, electricity and methanol, which is made from natural gas, can be alternatives to gasoline and diesel fuel. California Plan an Incentive</p> <p>Less-polluting vehicles have received more attention since Southern California adopted a stringent air-quality program last month that could eventually ban cars, trucks and buses that burn gasoline and diesel. The California plan is widely regarded as a precursor of measures that other urban areas will have to take.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The clean-air issue is turning a passing fancy with these alternate-fueled vehicles into a genuine interest,&#39;&#39; said Alfred A. DelliBovi, Administrator of the Urban Mass Transit Administration, who is about to become Under Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.</p> <p>To be sure, alternatives to gasoline-powered cars will require dramatic changes. For all three, fueling stops would have to be more frequent than with gasoline-powered cars. And the electric vehicles, while pleasingly quiet and vibration-free, will probably never accelerate as fast as gasoline cars.</p> <p>Such changes would also require a huge retooling in the auto industry and big alterations in the mix of petroleum products produced. Fuel marketing would have to be different, too.</p> <p>But if and when pollution or economics provides the impetus for the changes, engineering experts say, American industry already has the technological ability to produce less-polluting cars, trucks and buses.</p> <p>One challenge in coming years will be winning acceptance among some consumers for a vehicle for which fuel will not be widely available until more drivers are won over. The engineering experts say the nation lacks the infrastructure to produce and support large numbers of alternative-fuel vehicles - necessities like factory assembly lines to make the vehicles and garages to fix them. In fact, manufacturing capacity is so limited that the demand for demonstration models has outpaced producers&#39; ability to make the engines.</p> <p>The first large test of alternative fuels is likely to come when the Environmental Protection Agency puts into effect pollution standards for new buses in 1991. Similar rules for trucks are to follow in 1994.</p> <p>No diesel engine now on the market for buses can meet the standards, and major manufacturers are not sure engines can be modified to meet the rules in time.</p> <p>But diesel engines converted to burn methanol could meet the standards, the experts say.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The inventions are all done,&#39;&#39; said David F. Merrion, senior vice president of the Detroit Diesel Corporation, a diesel engine manufacturer that is beginning to produce methanol and natural gas versions. &#39;&#39;The invention was made back in the early 80&#39;s. We&#39;re now at the stage of manufacturing studies, production feasibility, evaluation of cost and determination of reliability and durability.&#39;&#39; An Electric Van</p> <p>On another front, the electric utility industry has been working with automobile manufacturers to develop a battery-powered electric van that can be driven up to 70 miles on a single charge of its batteries. Two of the vans are being tested, and within two years the van could be in use by small businesses like plumbers, florists and delivery companies.</p> <p>Such vehicles are best suited for local driving, situations in which they can be recharged overnight. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re looking at putting vehicles into niche markets,&#39;&#39; said Larry O&#39;Connell, manager of the transportation program at the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility consortium in Palo Alto, Calif., that has led the electric van effort.</p> <p>Electric cars are ideal for stop-and-go traffic, according to their proponents. Internal combustion engines get zero miles per gallon when stopped but idling, as at a traffic light. But when cars with electric motors are not moving, they use no energy.</p> <p>Natural gas engines produce almost no soot, the bane of diesel fuel, and less carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and hydrocarbons than gasoline engines.</p> <p>What is more, the supply of natural gas currently exceeds demand. Presumably, an increase in demand for transportation use would eliminate the surplus and drive up prices, but it would also stimulate exploration. Unlike oil, for which additional demand is met by increasing imports, gas can be produced in greater quantities in the United States and Canada, experts say. Some Drawbacks</p> <p>However, there are drawbacks to alternative fuels. For example, while methanol is cleaner than gasoline, it does produce formaldehyde and other poisons. And it introduces unique safety problems. For example, it burns without producing visible flames, and so is usually blended with gasoline as a safety measure. In addition, if it leaks, fumes collect at ground level, rather than dispersing, as does gasoline.</p> <p>What is more, gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles are currently far cheaper to buy than those modified to run on other fuels. That means that initially, ending air pollution with alternative-fuel cars will be more costly. For natural gas and methanol vehicles, the problem is that they are not mass-produced. With electric vehicles, the technology is a step behind.</p> <p>But advocates of natural gas say that a mass-produced car need not be any more expensive. And the price of the fuel, like the price of gasoline, would depend on supply and demand, although the price of natural gas could be lower because it does not require as much refining. Cost of the Fuels</p> <p>Methanol vehicles do not appear to require more labor or materials than gasoline vehicles. The fuel, however, will always cost more than natural gas, because it is produced from the gas. But at some point, if natural gas becomes more costly, methanol might be made from coal at an economically competitive price.</p> <p>Electricity as a fuel might also be competitive. If batteries are charged at night, when generating capacity would otherwise be idle, power can be sold for electric cars at low cost. But gains in cost and efficiency of batteries would be required for an economically competitive electric vehicle. Reluctance Among Car Makers</p> <p>Critics of the major auto makers, who have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to bring the gasoline engine to its current state of development, contend that the manufacturers are not enthusiastic about starting over with a new fuel.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Right now, there isn&#39;t enough enthusiasm in the mainstream of manufacturing,&#39;&#39; said Harvey W. Schultz, Commissioner of New York City&#39;s Department of Environmental Protection. He and others pointed out that because there is no market for the vehicles, there is no mass production, and therefore no product at an attractive price.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The talk in the business is that we&#39;ll have alternative-fuel vehicles when G.M. wants to build them,&#39;&#39; Mr. Schultz said.</p> <p>The growing issue of air pollution may produce regulations that help alternative-fuel vehicles. The British Columbia Project</p> <p>But one technology, natural gas, is flourishing on simple economics, at least in some locations. The crucial hurdle for alternative vehicles, fuel availability, appears to have been crossed in British Columbia, where the 50 service stations offer natural gas pumps next to pumps with leaded and unleaded gasoline. The stations, bearing familiar names like Shell and Texaco, take the gas from the underground mains that supply homes.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We sell it entirely on an economic basis,&#39;&#39; said Roger B. Anastasiou, a fueling-systems engineer with British Columbia Gas, a utility in Vancouver. Natural gas is sold in a unit equivalent in mileage value to gasoline but at half the price. The price difference includes a small tax break.</p> <p>Auto specialty stores that convert cars to run on natural gas charge about $2,500 for the job, and the province and the utilities will contribute about a third of the cost, after which the conversion is still expensive. But the cost would drop sharply if auto makers mass-produced the cars, Mr. Anastasiou said. The First U.S. Moves</p> <p>In the United States, about 25,000 vehicles owned by utilities for meter readers and the like run on natural gas, according to Alan Streb, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Conservation in the Department of Energy. Many vehicles are also running on methanol.</p> <p>Other vehicles that run on natural gas include some Pierce Transit buses in the Tacoma, Wash., area.</p> <p>Pierce Transit, a government agency, converted two of its 150 buses to natural gas two years ago, the first bus operator in the nation to do so, to Don S. Munroe, the executive director, said. After ironing out a few early problems, Pierce decided it would like to try more of the buses, and last month the agency won a grant of $8.3 million from the Urban Mass Transit Administration to buy them.</p> <p>The grant was the first under a $46.8 million program approved last year by the Federal Government to foster buses running on alternative fuels. The program has already attracted requests for financing of 406 buses around the country, according to Mr. DelliBovi, the Administrator.</p> <p>In Brooklyn, Command Bus Lines is running two natural gas-powered buses provided last year by Brooklyn Union Gas, and the utility recently displayed a gas-powered taxi that will enter service soon. Methanol Ventures</p> <p>The Triboro Coach Corporation is running six methanol-powered buses, built by General Motors, on various routes around New York City. And General Motors has just shipped the first dozen of 2,200 methanol cars to the state government in California, which plans to use them in government fleets and monitor their performance. The state hopes to put 5,000 on the road in the next few years.</p> <p>Last month, with a formal ceremony, Gov. George Deukmejian of California unveiled a methanol pump at an ARCO convenience store in Sacramento. According to the California Energy Commission, it is the nation&#39;s fifth.</p> <p>But on a per-mile basis, the fuel cost for a methanol vehicle can be five times the cost to run on diesel.</p> <p>Mr. DelliBovi said the new Environmental Protection Agency pollution standard for buses &#39;&#39;really creates a window for a niche market.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The window is exciting for the gas companies. For example, Columbia Gas, a utility in Ohio, has just given a test bus to the Central Ohio Transit Authority, at a cost of $300,000, in hopes the authority will buy more. The company stresses the reliability and economy of the fuel. And each bus on the road uses as much gas as 10 houses that use the fuel for heating and cooking, said William F. Morse, vice president for research.</p>
251171>A Split on the Value of 2-Hull Tankers The Exxon Valdez would probably have survived its grounding on Bligh Reef without leaking crude oil, or leaking far less, if it had had a double hull, according to some shipbuilders and marine architects.  <p>Such hulls were once promised by the Federal Government for tankers carrying Alaskan oil, but the requirement was dropped after lobbying by the oil companies, Exxon prominent among them.</p> <p>For years Exxon has maintained that having one hull inside the other, far from being an advantage, could make accidents worse in certain situations. And since its tanker went aground on March 24, the company has said that no design could have withstood the forces created when such a tremendous mass hits an immovable object.</p> <p>Exxon and some other companies also said that double-hulled tankers cost substantially more to build and operate. A Matter of Speculation</p> <p>The &#39;&#39;what if&#39;&#39; question about the Exxon Valdez is necessarily speculative, because an authoritative answer would rely on a detailed analysis of the internal structure of the ship, its bearing and speed, and the shape of the rock it hit. But experts not affiliated with Exxon said in interviews that broad conclusions could be drawn.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;For something like this, there might not have been any spill,&#39;&#39; said Dr. William Morgan, the director of ship hydromechanics at the Navy&#39;s David Taylor Model Basin, a test laboratory in Washington.</p> <p>The value of a double hull in this case may never be known, because the National Transportation Safety Board, which begins hearings in Anchorage on Tuesday, will not take up the question.</p> <p>Drucella Anderson, a spokeswoman for the board, said its inquiry would concentrate on human factors in the accident. The question of double hulls was explored extensively in the 1970&#39;s, she said.</p> <p>The Exxon Valdez has a single hull because the oil companies won the argument on the issue 10 years ago. They did so by prevailing in an international standards organization, the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization. The Coast Guard decided to follow that group&#39;s position, despite a study by a Coast Guard naval architect showing that double bottoms or double hulls would probably have prevented pollution in 27 of 30 tanker groundings from 1969 through 1973. Core of Believers</p> <p>Many experts still believe that double hulls would reduce the risk of pollution and might not raise costs.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;For any accident, you&#39;ve got to be better off with a double hull,&#39;&#39; said Everett C. Hunt, director of the Maritime Research Department at the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture, in Glen Cove, N.Y. &#39;&#39;You don&#39;t have to do a lot of calculation to come to that conclusion.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>With a double hull, &#39;&#39;there would be no spill of oil&#39;&#39; in an accident like that involving the Exxon Valdez, said another expert, Paul E. Atkinson, the president of a company that built three double-hulled vessels for the Valdez trade.</p> <p>Mr. Atkinson, who retired in 1977 as president of Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, a subsidiary of the Sun Oil Company, referred to the double-hulled vessels as &#39;&#39;ecology tankers.&#39;&#39; He said they cost about 5 percent more to build but were cheaper to run because the space between the hulls could be kept clean and used for ballast.</p> <p>In conventional tankers, which log half their miles without a cargo, the oil tanks must be filled with water for the empty run, to stabilize the ship. When the tankers load oil, that water is supposed to be disposed of properly.</p> <p>The value of a double hull for the Exxon Valdez is a tantalizing question because even though the tanker was several miles off course, the accident appears to have been a matter of feet.</p> <p>The tanker was drawing 55 feet 11 inches at the bow and 56 feet 1 inch at the stern when it ran aground, the Coast Guard said. According to a tide calculation by the Coast Guard office in Valdez, the spot where she hit was covered with 51 feet of water. Within the Margin</p> <p>The distance by which the tanker failed to clear the reef, 5 feet, is within the margin that would have been provided by a double hull. A standard formula considered by the Government in the mid-1970&#39;s called for a gap between the hulls of 1 foot for each 15 feet of beam of the tanker. The Exxon Valdez is about 166 feet wide, which would have meant a space on the bottom of 11 feet.</p> <p>Still, many experts, and the Coast Guard, dispute whether a double hull would have done the Exxon Valdez much good. They said the reef need not have made contact with the inner hull to crack it.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Even an 11-foot double hull would not have done any good at all,&#39;&#39; said Lieut. Comdr. Thomas Falkenstein, a Coast Guard spokesman in Valdez. He said the force of the impact could be transferred to an internal girder, which could be shoved into the inner tank, or the force of the impact on the rigid ship could make the inner hull crack.</p> <p>Lawrence G. Rawl, the chairman of Exxon Corporation, testified before a House subcommittee on April 6 that a double bottom would be useful only in a grounding on soft sand. In the case of a grounding on rock, he said, water could rush into the area between the hulls, upsetting the balance and creating the possibility of capsizing. The company has also argued in the past that gases from the cargo could escape into the space between the hulls, posing a hazard to the crew.</p> <p>Ms. Anderson said the safety board had made only one finding on double bottoms; in response to a 1973 tanker grounding in Cold Bay, Alaska, it recommended that single-hulled tankers operating in port areas be given extra supervision, &#39;&#39;to insure that the risk of polluting outflow from grounding while operating in a port area is commensurate with that of tankers outfitted with double bottoms.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Bligh Reef, where the Exxon Valdez ran aground, is outside the port area of Valdez.</p>
743032>Despite Route Cuts, Amtrak&#39;s Deep Financial Woes Continue Amtrak is in deep financial trouble despite the decision by its management in December to slash many long-distance routes, the General Accounting Office said yesterday, adding that the railroad would continue to deteriorate unless there were even bigger cuts or much bigger subsidies. Congress should reconsider &quot;whether Amtrak&#39;s original mission of providing nationwide intercity passenger rail service at the present level is still appropriate,&quot; the auditors said.  <p>Amtrak&#39;s president, Thomas M. Downs, said in December, when the cuts were announced, that deeper cuts would mean abandoning a national system in favor of a few heavily used corridors.</p> <p>The railroad subcommittee of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing today on Amtrak&#39;s intention, announced on Dec. 14, to eliminate 21 percent of its trains and to lay off about 20 percent of its workers. The cuts are meant to eliminate an annual deficit of nearly $200 million.</p> <p>But the railroad faces deeper problems, beyond its short-term operating deficit, according to the General Accounting Office, a Congressional agency.</p> <p>Amtrak has deferred maintenance on its rail cars, the auditors said, and by the end of 1993 &quot;costly overhauls were overdue for 40 percent of its nearly 1,900 cars.&quot; Cuts in maintenance and staffing have made the railroad less reliable, the G.A.O. said, adding that Amtrak had high maintenance costs because it had not modernized its maintenance facilities.</p> <p>In addition, in 1971, the year after Congress established Amtrak, the railroad signed 25-year agreements with the freight railroads, which own 97 percent of the track that Amtrak uses. When those agreements expire in April 1996, the freight lines will seek payments much higher than the $90 million a year they now receive, the accounting office said. Major labor contracts are also expiring.</p> <p>A spokesman for Amtrak, Robert J. Borella, said last night: &quot;We looked at the G.A.O.&#39;s report and it didn&#39;t offer that much more than we already knew. Amtrak has been under capitalized and hampered by outdated labor agreements.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Borella said that with better capital financing, Amtrak could attract more riders and eliminate the need for operating subsidies. He said the cuts announced in December were intended to trim the railroad to a size that its income and subsidies would support.</p> <p>The Federal Government has given Amtrak more than $13 billion since 1971. The accounting office said the railroad&#39;s financial and operating conditions had declined steadily since 1990, with high costs and lower revenue than anticipated, and a drop in passenger traffic, partly because of accidents. The railroad also faces stiff competition from the airlines, the study noted.</p> <p>&quot;It is unlikely that Amtrak can overcome its problems in financing, capital investments and service quality -- and continue to operate the present nationwide system -- without significant increases in passenger revenues and/or subsidies from Federal, state and local governments,&quot; the report said. &quot;G.A.O. believes that continuing the present course -- maintaining the same funding level and route system, even with the proposed cuts in service -- is neither feasible nor realistic because Amtrak will continue to deteriorate.&quot;</p> <p>One option for pruning the system further, the report said, would be to set up a commission of the kind that had selected military bases for closing.</p>
378012>Oil Prices Resume Rise as Tensions Grow Oil prices resumed their climb yesterday, as a nervous market contemplated the continuing loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude, the heightened tensions in the Middle East and a delay by OPEC members in increasing their oil production.  <p>In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for September delivery closed at $27.36 a barrel yesterday, up 90 cents from Wednesday.</p> <p>Traders said the market also rose on confusing news about the level of output by Saudi Arabia. The Japanese Foreign Ministry said early yesterday in Tokyo that Saudi Arabia had notified American, European and Japanese oil companies of a 15 to 20 percent planned supply cutback in September, but the Saudis later denied making such a notification. Industry experts said oil jargon might have created the confusion.</p> <p>Reassessing the tightening embargo on Iraq and Kuwait, oil company executives and other experts are also concluding that more than the loss of crude is involved; the United States Navy is now also blocking the output of three sophisticated Kuwaiti refineries, which could create further tightness in the market for refined products, especially gasoline. Gasoline may be due for further increases anyway because prices thus far do not fully reflect increased crude costs, oil company executives say.</p> <p>The rise in oil prices yesterday seemed to indicate a changing mood among traders. Last week and earlier this week, analysts said the absence of major developments in the Persian Gulf contributed to price stability. But now the mood is changing about who would benefit from a status quo, especially since Saudi Arabia has called for, thus far unsuccessfully, a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to permit higher production. Saudia Arabia can produce far more oil, and Venezuela promised to do so, but they want an OPEC agreement first.</p> <p>Analysts think an OPEC meeting would be exceptionally difficult because it would produce a dispute over who would represent Kuwait, among other problems. The organization met during the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, but was not able to accomplish much, experts say.</p> <p>Iran had some extra oil in storage and has been able to move it to market, experts say, but little if any oil from increased production is reaching the market.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Last week people thought that no news was O.K. news, because there would be good news forthcoming,&#39;&#39; said Cheryl J. Trench of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. &#39;&#39;Now, not only have we not had good news, but we&#39;ve had little negative pieces that are troubling.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Saudi Request</p> <p>Two such pieces of news today were a Saudi request for an emergency OPEC meeting, without a date or time being established, and the report of lower Saudi production next month.</p> <p>Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroelum Finance Company, a consulting firm in Washington, said the Saudis appeared to have cut &#39;&#39;nominations,&#39;&#39; but not deliveries. Nominations are orders from oil buyers, and they may have risen sharply in recent weeks. Even if the Saudis cut the nominations, the volume of deliveries could still rise from previous levels, he said.</p> <p>But &#39;&#39;what&#39;s dominating the market now is the probabilty of a flare-up,&#39;&#39; Mr. Zanoyan said.</p> <p>Shahrokh Nikkhah, an oil specialist at Prudential-Bache, said: &#39;&#39;The market obviously believes the only way out of this is a military solution.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The market is anticipating, if not an all-out military conflict, certainly the potential for some skirmishes, which could lead to acts of terrorism against Saudi facilities, Kuwaiti facilities or even Iraqi facilities.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>While prices may already incorporate the fear of more fighting, they do not approach the levels that would be reached if that fighting occurs, or even if no new production comes into the market, analysts say.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We are very bullish on this market,&#39;&#39; Mr. Nikkhah said. &#39;&#39;The probability of it going to $32 to $35 a barrel is very, very good.&#39;&#39; With military action, he said, &#39;&#39;the market could spike up substantially higher than $35.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Lacy H. Hunt, an economist who specializes in oil at Carroll McEntee &amp; McGinley, a government securities dealer, said: &#39;&#39;The longer this drags on, the more it serves to constrict oil supplies. At some point in time, it will be necessary to gradually release supplies from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in order to prevent prices from going a lot higher.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Bush Administration has thus far resisted that move.</p> <p>Five Million Barrels a Day</p> <p>Mr. Hunt said that with the current crisis, five million barrels of oil a day had been removed from the world market. That compares with the four million barrels at the time of the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74, and about two million barrels at the time of the Iranian revolution, in 1979.</p> <p>In addition, he said, the shortfall will be felt more this time because the United States now imports half its oil, up from about 45 percent in 1979, and 35 percent during the Arab embargo.</p> <p>The American Petroleum Institute, the industry&#39;s main trade association, reported yesterday that imports accounted for 51.3 percent of the oil used in this country in July.</p> <p>The institute reported deliveries of imported oil had been 6.5 percent higher than in the previous year, but that consumption had probably not grown that much, indicating that users at various levels were accumulating inventory, probably because prices were rising or expected to rise further. The report covers the period before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.</p> <p>Refining at Capacity</p> <p>The United States imports about 20 percent of its refined products, and domestic refineries are running at virtually full capacity. Experts say that relatively few foreign refineries can make gasoline for export to this country; only half make unleaded fuel, for example, which accounts for about 94 percent of the American market. In addition, wide areas of the United States now require the use of specially formulated fuel with low butane content, to cut air pollution.</p> <p>Apart from the rise in crude prices, many analysts are predicting that the price of gasoline will rise. A top executive of a leading oil company said yesterday that while his company was selling gasoline for about 10 cents a gallon more in the last six weeks, the cost of its crude oil had gone up about 25 cents a gallon.</p>
683771>April 17-24; Getting More Box for the Buck The 1990&#39;s version of good things coming in small packages? Good things now come in big packages, especially when they are small. Take, for example, a $279 fax-modem card, which is about the size of the credit card that paid for it. It comes in a cardboard box the size of, say, volume two of the Encyclopedia Britannica (Arizona through Bolivar, Simon). The modem is an accessory for a &quot;sub-notebook&quot; computer that is also about the size of an encyclopedic volume of an encyclopedia. But its box would hold eight or nine of the same computers.  <p>The trend didn&#39;t begin with electronics. For years, a guiding principle of the perfume industry has been that the smaller the amount being sold, the bigger and more elaborate the packaging.</p> <p>&quot;It just doesn&#39;t look very impressive if it comes in a little box,&quot; said Sonja M. Fenton, director of communications for the Polystyrene Packaging Council in Washington. &quot;Small, expensive things come in a large package so people will feel they&#39;re buying something substantial when they take it out.&quot;</p> <p>Miss Fenton quickly added that she had not seen any research that would back up this observation. But, she said, it &quot;makes sense that they would keep that research to themselves, and not share it with their trade organization.&quot; To do otherwise, she said, is to risk losing the competitive edge.</p> <p>On the other hand, Tiffany has done very nicely with tiny boxes. If a $3,000 diamond solitaire came in a box the same size as a $3,000 computer, it would ruin any suitor&#39;s chance of surprise. (If box size and carat rating were in strict proportion, though, the suitee would have a quick way of assessing the offering.)</p> <p>Thirty years ago a computer was the size of a room, and some people wondered if there was a person inside who made it go. Now people might wonder if a very smart person has a computer inside.</p> <p>Analysts of technology use the term &quot;dematerialization&quot; to describe innovations that enable devices to do more and more with less and less, from microchips replacing vacuum tubes to fax machines replacing postal trucks.</p> <p>But the packaging of new, smaller, lighter equipment in ever-clunkier wrappings drives environmentalists up the wall. &quot;With computers, where small is beautiful, it&#39;s counter-intuitive,&quot; said Susan Alexander, a spokeswoman at the Public Media Center, a non-profit public relations agency in San Francisco that serves many environmental groups. &quot;It&#39;s pretty perverse.&quot;</p> <p>Robert I. Goldberg, executive director of the Center for Packaging Education, an industry trade group in Brooklyn, offered yet another explanation for the outsized casing.</p> <p>Manufacturers ship products in &quot;master cartons,&quot; he said. Even if the product, like a computer, gets smaller, they still want to use the old design for master cartons; the box sold to the consumer cannot be made any smaller or it will bounce around inside the larger shipping case. Paying for Empty Space?</p> <p>Companies also get a discount for shipping by the truckload, Mr. Goldberg said. Although the truck may be able to carry twice as many computers as before, the store may not want to stock twice as many. &quot;When you don&#39;t fill the truck, you pay for empty space,&quot; he said. So there is little incentive in making the container small.</p> <p>&quot;Since they&#39;re using expanded foam inside for protection, they just make the foam a little bigger,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Louis J. Slovinsky, a consultant at Siegal &amp; Gayle, which specializes in corporate identity -- a field that includes logos, graphics and packaging -- said his new laptop computer was &quot;more stuffing than computer.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a conspiracy by the cardboard manufacturers,&quot; he said, but added that it might be a conspiracy by United Parcel Service.</p> <p>And then there are some explanations that are not as much fun.</p> <p>&quot;Unfortunately, small items have a dreadful habit of walking out of stores by themselves,&quot; said Clive Chajet, chairman of Lippincott &amp; Margulies, another consulting firm. &quot;To discourage pilferage, small items are frequently over-packaged.&quot;</p> <p>And electronic items do need some protection, although as Ms. Alexander noted, many of these items are meant to be carried around and therefore cannot accommodate too much padding.</p> <p>Some, like the modem, need a big box to allow space for a full description of their features as well as the obligatory four-color photography. Packages are sometimes called traveling billboards for the product inside, and it is hard to scream &quot;new!&quot; and &quot;improved!&quot; in small spaces.</p> <p>John A. McIntyre, president of the Paperboard Packaging Council, in Washington, believes that deterrence of pilferage and physical shielding of equipment are the real reasons for big boxes, but he pointed out a downside of all this that they&#39;ll be living with for a while. &quot;We always save all the boxes, in case we need to send them back,&quot; he said.</p>
1764431>Agency Plays Down Plan To Speed Airport Security Allowing frequent fliers to bypass much of the airport security hassle in exchange for giving up some personal information in advance has yet to happen, four years after the idea was first proposed. The concept, first called &#39;&#39;trusted traveler,&#39;&#39; emerged weeks after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and was popular with some airlines, frequent fliers and lawmakers. But now, the Transportation Security Administration is suggesting that the benefits will range from slim to none, except perhaps for the likelihood that the line waiting to reach the checkpoint will be shorter.  <p>Kip Hawley, director of the Transportation Security Administration, told reporters this week that the concept, now called &#39;&#39;registered traveler,&#39;&#39; was not a priority because it would not cut risk of a terrorist attack. And if private entrepreneurs assembled a package of tools that helped identify threats to security -- including background checks and perhaps equipment at the checkpoint that would sniff, scan or otherwise sense explosives -- the payoff might be that such qualified travelers would not have to remove their shoes or suit coats, or take laptops out of their briefcases for inspection.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If we get enough things in there that raise the bar, then we can say, Yes, you can keep your coat on or your shoes, or whatever,&#39;&#39; Mr. Hawley said.</p> <p>In fact, a T.S.A. laboratory in Atlantic City is testing a device developed by General Electric, with technology similar to a hospital magnetic resonance imaging machine, that looks for shoe bombs.</p> <p>General Electric, in addition to being a supplier of airport security equipment, also owns a minority share in the only company now operating a &#39;&#39;registered traveler&#39;&#39; checkpoint in Orlando, Fla., Verified Identity Pass Inc. G.E. is working on a second device that might let screeners determine with confidence whether a briefcase stuffed with a laptop computer had a bomb in it.</p> <p>But Mr. Hawley said that if the private companies that want to offer such &#39;&#39;registered traveler&#39;&#39; services could successfully develop detection technology, his agency would consider buying and deploying it for general use.</p> <p>After Sept. 11, many aviation experts said checking a traveler&#39;s criminal background could determine how much screening was necessary. But Mr. Hawley and others said that terrorist attacks on London buses and subways last summer showed that attackers need not be foreigners or have criminal backgrounds.</p> <p>Proponents of a registered traveler program are disappointed with the lack of progress.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You cannot imagine the frustration up here,&#39;&#39; said Representative John L. Mica, Republican of Florida and chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re screening the same people over and over again,&#39;&#39; he said, arguing that people who have security clearances, are in the armed forces or law enforcement, work as commercial airline pilots, and a variety of others need not be screened.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s turned into a farce,&#39;&#39; Mr. Mica said. &#39;&#39;They&#39;ve gone around the corner so many times, they&#39;re running around in circles and they&#39;ve accomplished nothing.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But the pilot program in Orlando has proved popular. Verified Identity, which charges $80 a year, said it had signed up 23,000 people. Its members go to a dedicated lane where the wait is generally two to four minutes, said Steven Brill, founder of the company. Airports in San Jose, Calif.; Indianapolis; and Cincinnati will follow soon, he said, and he added that his company would soon announce a partnership with a major airline. In February, Hyatt Hotels and Resorts said it would give away memberships to its best customers.</p> <p>Mr. Brill said that even if the government decided to buy for all security checkpoints the technology developed for the registered traveler program, his customers would still have the better equipment two years earlier, in a process of continuous improvement.</p> <p>At the moment, the company&#39;s security lanes at the Orlando airport offer a &#39;&#39;concierge&#39;&#39; who helps travelers get their metal objects in and out of bins for scanning, and better bins and tables, Mr. Brill said, but he added that &#39;&#39;this program would never succeed if it was just a program that put people at the head of the line.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Mica, though, said the operation in Orlando, which is near his district, &#39;&#39;just puts people at the front of the line, and irritates the other travelers.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In fact, some airlines allow passengers in the top levels of their frequent-flier programs to move to the front of the line, reducing the commercial value of a trusted traveler system. The T.S.A.&#39;s goal is no more than a 10-minute wait for everyone, but that is sometimes exceeded, Mr. Hawley said.</p> <p>Not everyone likes the idea of preferential treatment for some passengers. Mr. Hawley said he would not approve a system that reduced security, cost the government money or disadvantaged nonmembers.</p> <p>George F. Doughty, executive director of the Lehigh Northampton Airport Authority in Allentown, Pa., said he would not allow such a system because in a small airport it would mean longer waits for other passengers.</p> <p>He added: &#39;&#39;Right now this is driven by the commercial side. If the commercial interests weren&#39;t there, I don&#39;t think you&#39;d see too many people pushing this.&#39;&#39;</p>
178970>Solar Power Plant Planned for California In a landmark in the development of solar power, a company that currently makes patio lights powered by the sun said yesterday that it would build a $125 million plant in the desert near Los Angeles to make large amounts of electricity directly from sunlight.  <p>The power would be sold at a profit to the Southern California Edison Company, under a rate established several years ago to encourage production of energy from renewable sources.</p> <p>The Chronar Corporation of Princeton, N.J., said its plant would be seven times larger than any existing power station of its type, which is called photovoltaic.

A Reduction in Cost</p> <p>An Energy Department spokesman, Roger Meyer, said new mass production of the solar cells had apparently permitted an important reduction in cost, which he described as a &#39;&#39;breakthrough.&#39;&#39; He added, however, that the technology to be used was not new, nor was it the most advanced available.</p> <p>Chronar&#39;s cells, of a type called amorphous silicon, can convert only 5 to 6 percent of the sun&#39;s energy to electricity; a company called Energy Conversion Devices of Troy, Mich., has developed cells consisting of several layers that has an efficiency of 13.7 percent and has succeeded in licensing its technology for use abroad for $15 million.</p> <p>But its cost per watt of capacity is higher than the figure estimated by Chronar for its new plant.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Photovoltaics are everybody&#39;s dream answer to energy needs,&#39;&#39; said Chronar&#39;s founder and chariman, Zoltan J. Kiss, in a telephone interview. &#39;&#39;The problem was, it was always too costly.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Until now, the cost of photovoltaic cells has been considered too high to compete with conventional energy sources like coal and oil. Many companies have found a niche by providing power sources for locations cut off from the power grid. Chronar, the only domestic manufacturer now operating profitably, has found success in patio and walkway lights, which use the sun to charge a battery during the day and then switch on at dusk. In June, the company shipped 100,000 such lights under its own brand name, Mr. Sabisky said.</p> <p>While the Chronar plant would dwarf other photovoltaic facilities, another company, Luz International Ltd., has four 30-megawatt plants already on line.</p> <p>Luz sells power to Southern California Edison under the same kind of contract that Chronar will use, under a structure established in the early 1980&#39;s to encourage alternative energy sources. According to R. Dean Gallagher, senior project development manager for Southern California Edison, the structure set the price to be paid by the utility at relatively generous levels.</p> <p>With the collapse of oil prices in 1986 and other developments, he said, &#39;&#39;at this point in time, it&#39;s very uneconomical for our ratepayers.&#39;&#39;</p>
1523239>Auditors Criticize Agency About Drills On Nuclear Security Congressional auditors cast doubt today on the usefulness of the drills that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission uses to check security at power plants, saying that the mock &#39;&#39;attackers&#39;&#39; are undertrained and underarmed and that the defenders are unrealistically overstaffed. The auditors, from the General Accounting Office, said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission often found security problems, like guards sleeping, but did not issue formal violation notices and then declared that security was adequate.  <p>Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who requested the study, said the accounting office had documented &#39;&#39;a disturbing pattern of lax N.R.C. oversight and inattention to security at these sensitive facilities that are at the very top of Al Qaeda&#39;s list for future attacks.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But Roy P. Zimmerman, director of the commission&#39;s office of nuclear security and incident response, said that his agency had recently improved the drills and that it required that each problem be fixed, even if it had not been listed as a violation.</p> <p>The commission had been holding &#39;&#39;force on force&#39;&#39; drills every eight years at each reactor but dropped them after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001; it resumed them earlier this year and has said it hopes to establish a schedule of every three years. The drills have been criticized by outside security experts, but the current critique is the first serious one from another branch of government, in this case the auditors who perform studies for Congress.</p> <p>According to the accounting office, nuclear plant operators &#39;&#39;used plant defenses that were enhanced beyond those used during normal operations,&#39;&#39; and the attackers, who are often off-duty security guards or guards drawn from other plants, supervisors from the plant being tested or local police officers, are strong on defensive tactics but not trained as terrorists.</p> <p>Mr. Zimmerman acknowledged that &#39;&#39;in some cases the individuals may not have aggressive offensive tactics training.&#39;&#39;</p>
757425>Crash Cited at a Hearing on Runway Risk In a last transmission to the control tower at the St. Louis airport, just before an 80-ton T.W.A. jet bore down on a twin-engine Cessna, the pilot of the small plane radioed that he was &quot;ready to go on the right side.&quot; But the pilot of the chartered plane did not specify runway 31 right, where he had been assigned to wait, or 30 right, where the plane actually was. In any case, the local air-traffic controller testified at a hearing today that she never heard the pilot&#39;s radio message and that even if she had, she would have had no reason to doubt that the Cessna was on the runway to which it had been assigned.  <p>As a result, the crew of the T.W.A. jet had no warning that another plane was in their path as they sped down the runway until they sighted it about two seconds before the impact, long enough to swerve to the left and to reverse the engines and apply the brakes, but not to slow the plane by much. None of the 140 people aboard the MD-80 jet were hurt but both occupants of the Cessna, the pilot and co-pilot, were killed.</p> <p>This kind of accident occurs, witnesses told the National Transportation Safety Board today, because a combination of bad operating procedures and bad equipment leave no margin for error.</p> <p>The board heard testimony on the accident, which occurred on Nov. 22, as part of its investigation of &quot;runway incursions,&quot; cases in which a moving object gets in the way of a plane landing or taking off. On Thursday the board is expected to focus on shortcomings around the country.</p> <p>Susan Anne Baumer, the controller at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, told the board today that at the time of the accident the Federal Aviation Administration had not finished installing a computerized radar system that would have given controllers a much clearer view of objects on the ground at the airport, and that might have showed them that the charter plane was in the wrong spot.</p> <p>Technicians had tried out the system, but were still working out the bugs, Ms. Baumer testified. &quot;It had been operating a couple of days before it happened,&quot; she said. &quot;My understanding is the hard drive on it crashed and they had not been able to bring it back up yet.&quot;</p> <p>After years of delays, the radar system, known as Airport Surface Runway Detection Equipment, has been put into service at Lambert and 10 other airports, with 26 more scheduled.</p> <p>Today the pilot of the Trans World Airlines jet, Donald R. Carr, said he was not sure if the radar system would have prevented the accident, but he said he believed it would help keep track of planes on the runway. According to the aviation agency, one runway incursion is reported for every 300,000 takeoffs or landings, although some controllers and pilots say that the actual rate may be far high.</p> <p>Ms. Baumer, the St. Louis controller, also said the system was helpful, but she, too, was uncertain whether it would have prevented the accident.</p> <p>One step that the safety board believes would be helpful is to require that pilots repeat back commands that they receive from controllers, instead of merely acknowledging them. Most airline pilots already follow this procedure, known a &quot;readbacks,&quot; but pilots of smaller planes do not.</p> <p>The aviation agency said today that though it shared the board&#39;s goal of reducing risks on the runway, it would continue to recommend rather than require readbacks because it wanted to avoid issuing &quot;unnecessary and costly regulations.&quot;</p> <p>Another witness, Dr. Glennis Adam, an air safety specialist at the Mitre Corporation, a research organization in McLean, Va., said it would be impractical to require readbacks. &quot;There isn&#39;t time for that kind of thing anymore,&quot; she said, noting that radio frequencies at busy airports were extremely congested.</p>
853594>Puzzling New Issue Surrounds Suspect Cargo in Jetliner Crash The shipping of oxygen generators on the Valujet DC-9 that crashed in the Everglades on May 11 was not only risky, experts say, but also pointless. The generators, devices that produce intense heat when activated, are prime suspects in a fire that investigators say occurred just before the plane went down, killing all 110 people on board.  <p>Valujet says it loaded the generators, which had come from three of its other planes, as cargo on the DC-9 because labels on the shipping boxes that contained them indicated that they were empty, and thus not a threat, although it now seems likely that at least some were not empty.</p> <p>In any event, if Valujet thought they were empty, it should have thought they were useless, aviation experts at several other companies say. The generators, which provide oxygen flow to passenger emergency masks when installed as equipment on airliners, can cost from $100 to $200 apiece when new. But they are worthless when, emptied of their chemical contents, only a canister is left, or  when their shelf life has expired.</p> <p>So there would have been little apparent point in shipping them from Miami, where the doomed plane had just taken off when it crashed, to Valujet&#39;s base in  Atlanta, where the flight was headed.</p> <p>Oxygen generators are &quot;a throwaway deal,&quot; said M.R. Kaletta, vice president of Scott Aviation, the devices&#39; leading manufacturer. &quot;I don&#39;t know why they&#39;d even be doing that.&quot;</p> <p>At United Airlines, Joe Hopkins, a spokesman, said: &quot;Once these canisters are discharged, they&#39;re junked, they&#39;re trashed. We don&#39;t recycle them or have them  recharged; the way the mechanism works, it&#39;s not something that can be easily re-used.&quot;</p> <p>Valujet had no immediate explanation of why it had hauled the generators, except that the boxes containing them had carried shipping tickets marked &quot;Ship  To:&quot; and then, handwritten, &quot;Valujet Airlines, Concourse C, Gate 28, Hartsfield  Airport&quot; in Atlanta. The labels said the generators were empty, which would mean they were nearly inert.</p> <p>The shipping tickets, Valujet said, were filled out by Sabretech, a company that was renovating three MD-80 planes for the airline and so had removed the generators from them.</p> <p>A Sabretech spokesman, Kenneth P. Quinn, said his company had simply been following standard practice in returning to a customer airline anything taken off its planes.</p> <p>Barry Bender, director of quality control at Evergreen Air Center in Marana,  Ariz., another company that replaces the generators on jetliners, agreed that it was routine practice to return the canisters to an airline. The reason, he said, is to save the contractor the cost of disposing of them.</p> <p>Sabretech and Valujet are trying not to blame each other too pointedly. &quot;At this stage of the investigation,&quot; Mr. Quinn said in a statement, &quot;we don&#39;t find  it particularly helpful to engage in public finger-pointing; it demeans the loss suffered by the loved ones of the passengers and crew on Flight 592, and can only complicate the difficult job of Federal investigators.&quot;</p> <p>But, he said, regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration forbid an airline to accept hazardous material unless it is properly packed.  New oxygen generators are shipped with two independent protections against accidental activation: First, they usually have a protective cap. Second, the regular activation mechanism -- a lanyard tied to a pin that must be pulled out to start the reaction -- is disabled by tying the lanyard tight.</p> <p>The generators in question had been taken off the three Valujet MD-80&#39;s because they had exceeded their 12-year shelf life. Thus, experts said, they had no value, spent or whole, and there would have been no savings for Valujet or Sabretech in mislabeling the boxes so the generators could be shipped by air. Indeed, the experts said, there would have been no savings in shipping them anywhere by any means.</p> <p>The generators work by mixing together two chemicals to produce oxygen for about 15 minutes. The reaction also produces great heat: more than 400 degrees at the surface of the device, which is a little bigger than a coffee thermos.</p> <p>After the reaction is complete, what remains is a stainless steel canister filled mostly with table salt. Getting the salt out would meanmore effort than the canister is worth, said Mr. Kaletta, the executive with Scott Aviation, the  chief manufacturer of the generators.</p> <p>Others agreed, including the Boeing Company. &quot;When we take them off the airplane, we would put them in a special bucket, then discharge them,&quot; said Richard F. Schleh, a Boeing spokesman. &quot;After it&#39;s discharged, we cool it in water. At that point, we would dispose of it in some environmentally compatible  way.&quot;</p> <p>In July 1994, Boeing discharged too many of the devices in a barrel at the Seattle-Tacoma airport, and the resulting heat started a fire.</p> <p>On Sunday, Valujet distributed a statement by an employee, Richard D&#39;Arcy, who had worked with Sabretech. Mr. D&#39;Arcy said he had told Sabretech that Valujet did not want the canisters back.</p> <p>Sabretech has acknowledged that the boxes containing the shipped generators were labeled &quot;empty.&quot; But Mr. Quinn, the Sabretech spokesman, said employees of  the company denied having received any instructions from Mr. D&#39;Arcy on disposal.</p> <p>Investigators at the scene of the crash said on Sunday that they had found metal caps from generators embedded in a partly burned tire that had also been carried as cargo. The investigators have strong evidence of a fire, and possibly an explosion, just before the crash and say the oxygen generators and three tires stored in the forward cargo hold are leading suspects.</p>
59246>15TH PRESIDENT INSTALLED AT DARTMOUTH Dartmouth College yesterday inaugurated a president who used his first official speech to set a new tone for the college, which is known in the Ivy League for strong school spirit and adherence to tradition.  <p>&#39;&#39;We must strengthen our attraction for those singular students whose greatest pleasures may not come from the camaraderie of classmates but from the lonely acts of writing poetry, or mastering the cello, or solving mathematical riddles, or translating Catullus,&#39;&#39; said James O. Freedman, drawing applause from the audience. &#39;March to Different Drummer&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We must make Dartmouth a hospitable environment for students who march to a different drummer,&#39;&#39; he said; &#39;&#39;for those creative loners and daring dreamers whose commitment to the intellectual and artistic life is so compelling that they appreciate, as Prospero reminded Shakespeare&#39;s audiences, that for certain persons a library is dukedom large enough.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A crowd of 2,500 watched Mr. Freedman become the college&#39;s 15th president as he was presented with the original college charter, issued in 1769 by the royal governor of New Hampshire. First Without Ties to College</p> <p>Mr. Freedman, 51 years old, graduated cum laude from Harvard College in 1957, and received an LL.B. from Yale Law School in 1962, also cum laude. He is the first president since 1822 to come to Dartmouth without previous ties to the college.</p> <p>He is the former president of the University of Iowa and the former dean of the University of Pennsylvania law school.</p> <p>His wife, Bathsheba, a faculty member at Iowa, will teach psychology at Dartmouth. The couple has two children: Deborah, 22, of Washington, D.C., and Jared, 17, who will be a freshman at Harvard in the fall.</p> <p>Mr. Freedman replaced David T. McLaughlin, who was named to the post in 1981 and presided over the college in a period of strong growth in programs, physical facilities and the size of the endowment, and also considerable campus turmoil. Dispute Over Shanties</p> <p>Dartmouth was shaken by a dispute in January 1986, in which a group of conservative students staged a midnight sledgehammer raid on a cluster of shanties erected on the college&#39;s picturesque green. The group that built the shanties favored purging the Dartmouth endowment of stock in companies doing business in South Africa.</p> <p>The result of the attack, by a group associated with a conservative campus publication, the Dartmouth Review, was a furor over the rights of free speech and protest, and allegations of racism among students and by the college itself.</p> <p>Three of the students who were involved in the sledgehammer attack, and who were later suspended by the college, filed suit against Dartmouth in Federal District Court in Concord last week, seeking to have their records cleared and for a court order barring the college from &#39;&#39;harassing, intimidating or interfering with&#39;&#39; the Dartmouth Review. &#39;Judged by Force of Our Reason&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Freedman, who was also given a 202-year-old medal customarily presented to incoming presidents and engraved with the words, &#39;&#39;Unanimity is the strength of society,&#39;&#39; referred in his speech to the strong differences of opinion on the campus.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Maintenance of the sense of community that unites Dartmouth College will depend upon the civility with which we express those differences and the respect and tolerance that we show for those who hold opposing views,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;In the end, we will be judged not by the shrillness of our rhetoric or the self-dramatization of our actions, but by the quiet, measured force of our reason.&#39;&#39;</p>
361748>Oil Companies Rethink Risks of Having Tankers The explosion on the tanker Mega Borg, along with the wreck of the Exxon Valdez and other spills, is giving some major oil companies second thoughts about their liability as owners of tankers.  <p>Complaining of a welter of different state and Federal laws, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group said on Monday that it would stop using tankers it owns or manages to carry heavy oil to United States ports, with the exception of an offshore terminal near Louisiana. Because the United States has not ratified international protocols limiting shipowners&#39; liability, the company said, &#39;&#39;A shipowner who is involved in a pollution incident in the U.S.A., even when he has behaved properly, responsibly and without negligence, may face largely uninsurable exposure to claims which far outweigh the potential commercial reward from such trade.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The decision affects about 40,000 barrels a day of crude oil and heavy oil products. That amount contrasts with about8 million barrels that arrive in this country daily in tankers from abroad. Experts said that the move by Royal Dutch did not mean that the oil would cease to come to American ports, but simply that it would not come in that company&#39;s ships.</p> <p>No Effect on Shell Oil</p> <p>The decision does not affect the Shell Oil Company, a wholly owned American subsidiary of the English-Dutch multinational that is based in Houston. But Shell Oil, because it is foreign-owned, is barred from owning its own tankers, said a spokesman, Norman Altstedter. It chartered 49 vessels in the first quarter of this year, 6 of them belonging to its parent, he said.</p> <p>No other companies have pulled out abruptly, but the specter of the Exxon Corporation&#39;s spending nearly $2 billion even before the first liability suit comes to trial or any fines have been paid has weighed heavily on major oil companies, experts said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I think that everybody is looking over the rewards and the risks,&#39;&#39; said Jerry Aspland, the president of Arco Marine Inc., a subsidiary of the Atlantic Richfield Company.</p> <p>Arco Marine has adopted a tactic directly opposite from Royal Dutch/ Shell, deciding that oil it owns will be moved only in its own ships, in spite of the primary liability in an accident falling on the tanker&#39;s owner. &#39;&#39;We think we have better control that way, and therefore, have some control over the liability,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Aspland. The company&#39;s 10 ships carry crude oil from Valdez, Alaska, to California.</p> <p>Tankers Pose &#39;a Large Risk&#39;</p> <p>Arco Marine now carries $1.25 billion of insurance on each ship, according to Oliver Williams, the senior adviser for maritime affairs. The industry standard is $500 million, although the Mega Borg carries $700 million.</p> <p>One analyst for a New York-based brokerage house, who asked not to be identified by name, said that the major oil companies were drifting away from the business. &#39;&#39;From an environmental standpoint, it has come to be a large risk,&#39;&#39; the analyst said. &#39;&#39;And they can&#39;t compete as effectively as some of the independent shipowners. If you&#39;re a Greek, you can have a Panamanian registration and have Taiwanese or Indian crewmen, and your crew size can be substantially smaller. If you&#39;re a U.S. corporation, it&#39;s a lot trickier to have foreign registry and foreign crews.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>At the American Petroleum Institute, the industry&#39;s main trade organization, Charles DiBona, the president, said that the effect of the burning tanker in the Gulf of Mexico, along with the spill by the Exxon Valdez, was that &#39;&#39;everybody&#39;s going to say, is that business worth the immense risks?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Everyone knows no matter how careful you are, ships at sea are ships at sea,&#39;&#39; said Mr. DiBona. Pointing out that the Exxon Valdez damage could come to $3 billion or $4 billion, and that that is more than the net worth of all but a handful of oil companies, he said, &#39;&#39;Could you afford to risk your whole company every time you move a ship?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>More Oil to Come by Tanker</p> <p>The result, said Mr. DiBona, might be that major companies would get out of oil shipping and leave it to corporations whose only asset was a single ship. If the practice changes so that cargo owners also become liable for damage, he said, oil companies might might shift their way of operating so they own neither the ship nor the cargo, but buy oil once it has been brought ashore.</p> <p>No matter who owns the oil at sea or the tankers that carry it, experts say that more and more oil will come to the United States by tanker. The country now imports about half its oil, and the proportion is likely to rise steadily in years to come. In addition, more and more of the world&#39;s oil production is now located in the Persian Gulf, meaning that the average distance that oil travels by tanker is also rising.</p> <p>International shippers have sought to limit their liability by urging the adoption of the protocols cited by Royal Dutch/Shell. Those treaties, developed by the International Maritime Organization, an affiliate of the United Nations, and adopted by most European nations, set a limit on liability of about $600 per gross ton of ship size. The treaties also establish a fund to pay claims.</p> <p>A bill incorporating those treaties passed the House of Representatives earlier this year, and would replace an existing Federal limit of $300 per ton. The House bill would also impose liability on the cargo owner. The Senate also passed a bill that would raise ship owners&#39; liability, and the bills are now in a conference committee.</p> <p>By incorporating the international protocol, the House bill would override state laws. Some states have no limit on liability, but overriding such state laws is opposed by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader who is from a state with unlimited liability.</p> <p>The Congress has been struggling with oil spill liability legislation since Representative Gerry E. Studds, a Massachusetts Democrat, introduced legislation in 1975. He has done so every year since.</p> <p>At the Merchant Marine Committee&#39;s Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation and the Environment, of which Mr. Studds is chairman, William Woodward, the staff director, said: &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve attempted to pass it every year since 1975. But now we have had the Exxon Valdez, which has led to a resurgence of interest in oil-spill legislation.&#39;&#39;</p>
587257>Prosecutor Says Jurors Erred in Arms-Plant Case The United States Attorney who prosecuted the case against the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant said yesterday that the grand jury, which wanted to bring more charges, had misunderstood what constituted a hazardous waste, what constituted a crime and how violations could be ended by agreements with regulators. Last spring, Rockwell International, which ran Rocky Flats under contract with the Department of Energy from 1975 to 1989, pleaded guilty to 10 violations of Federal environmental laws and agreed to pay a fine of $18.5 million. But the grand jury that heard the case, and was dismissed when the plea agreement was announced, was dissatisfied with that result. A majority of the grand jurors later signed a letter to Bill Clinton, then President-elect, asking for an investigation of the way the Justice Department handled the case.  Millions of Pages of Data The report -- prepared after the jurors had sat for more than two years, heard more than 100 witnesses and reviewed millions of  <p>The report -- prepared after the jurors had sat for more than two years, heard more than 100 witnesses and reviewed millions of pages of documents -- called for prosecution of individual employees of Rockwell and the Department of Energy, and said crimes were continuing.</p> <p>Late Tuesday the Justice Department made public excerpts from the grand jury report, along with extensive rebuttal comments by prosecutors in the case. In an accompanying legal brief, the prosecutor, Michael Norton, noted that excerpts had already appeared in two publications, and said, &quot;Largely due to the United States&#39; inability to use grand jury information to respond to or refute these falsities, the public perception is being created that the Government has behaved irresponsibly, which is patently false.&quot;</p> <p>Excerpts from the grand jury report were published in Harpers magazine and in Westword, a weekly tabloid distributed free in the Denver area.</p> <p>Mr. Norton&#39;s rebuttal was highly critical of a Congressional investigation into his handling of the case and of news reporting about the matter. In his brief he said the published excerpts had been &quot;generally taken verbatim&quot; from the grand jury report, which is supposed to be secret.</p> <p>The brief contended that the grand jury had made accusations that were not justified by the evidence or were not supported by any evidence. And it said the jurors&#39; assertion that violations of waste-handling laws were continuing was simply wrong.</p> <p>There is no legal way to dispose of the wastes, the prosecutor said, and moreover the wastes in question, radioactive material mixed with toxic chemicals, were now subject to detailed agreements between the Environmental Protection Agency and the Colorado Department of Health.</p> <p>Thomas Looby, director of the department&#39;s Office of Environment, said yesterday, &quot;We do have enforceable agreements to bring them into compliance.&quot; But he added, &quot;There have been and continue to be violations of the rules.&quot;  Prosecutor Defends Inquiry</p> <p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Norton said, &quot;We went into this investigation with the idea of finding things that were truly crimes, not events or opportunities or conduct that were well known to the regulators but for which there was no regulatory solution.&quot;</p> <p>Asked why the grand jury wanted more charges brought, he said: &quot;I don&#39;t know. You&#39;d have to ask the grand jurors what motivation, if any, they had for pressing forward with ill-founded fact-based issues or law-based issues.&quot;</p> <p>Former members of the grand jury said yesterday that they were still bound by their secrecy oath. Indeed, a footnote in Mr. Norton&#39;s brief says that &quot;a criminal investigation of the illegal release of grand jury material has been undertaken.&quot;</p> <p>The published excerpts from the grand jury report did not make it clear what fraction of the whole report the excerpts represented. Most of the 124 pages made public was the Justice Department&#39;s rebuttal to the grand jury report.</p>
722022>Suit to Block Emission Rules Is Dismissed A Federal District Court judge in Syracuse has thrown out a lawsuit by the Big Three auto manufacturers to block New York State&#39;s adoption of the California low-emission vehicle rules. New York now requires that all new cars sold within the state meet California&#39;s tough emission standards. The Ford Motor Company, General Motors and the Chrysler Corporation complained that because New York has not also adopted California&#39;s strict standards on gasoline, if they are forced to meet the stricter emissions standards they would have to manufacture a car especially for use in New York. Under the Federal Clean Air Act, other states may adopt California&#39;s rules or use the Federal rules, but may not require a third option.  <p>Thomas J. McAvoy, Chief Judge of the Federal District Court, had initially sided with the auto companies when the case was filed in 1992. But in the decision released yesterday, he said that New York had not, thus far, threatened to penalize the auto companies if their cars failed to meet California standards on New York fuel.</p> <p>In a statement, Langdon Marsh, the Commission of Environmental Protection, said: &quot;Americans, especially New Yorkers, have never been comfortable with the argument that something just cannot be done. If cleaner cars are being built for California, of course they can be built for New York, for Massachusetts and for other states that want the benefits of clean air.&quot;</p> <p>The companies were not sure yesterday if they would appeal. They are seeking, through negotiations with the states and with the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, to have New York and Massachusetts rescind their adoption of the California program.</p>
227319>New Radiation Study Planned in Ohio Government scientists will re-evaluate and possibly recalculate the Department of Energy&#39;s estimates of radiation exposure and cancer risks to residents in the area of the Fernald uranium plant in Ohio, Senator John Glenn said yesterday.  <p>The Department of Energy has been trying for four years to complete a study of radiation doses resulting from radiation escaping from the plant but has repeatedly found omissions and errors it its work.</p> <p>Under an agreement announced yesterday, scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health will compare the department&#39;s conclusions to the raw data from 30 years of operation and, where necessary make new estimates based on production records.</p> <p>The agreement is the most recent product of a lingering mistrust by residents of the area and critics of the Energy Department, which has recently acknowledged major problems in its nuclear weapon production plants at Fernald and at other sites around the country. Study Estimates Cancer Cases</p> <p>Senator Glenn, an Ohio Democrat, announced the agreement at a news conference in Cincinnati, 20 miles from the plant. Also at the news conference, the Radioactive Waste Campaign, an environmental group, distributed a study estimating Fernald&#39;s releases of radioactivity into the environment around the plant will cause between 18 and 187 cases of cancer to the people who have lived within 5 miles, a population now of 11,000. The Energy Department last year estimated zero additional cases of cancer, but later withdrew that estimate after determining that more radioactive dust had escaped than it had earlier known. Currently it has no estimate of the health effects from Fernald radioactive emissions.</p> <p>Critics say the Department, through incompetence or deliberate sloppiness, has failed to find all the sources of radiation so that it will underestimate radiation exposures and thus, the cancer risk of neighbors.</p> <p>The Fernald plant turns uranium from a liquid into metal ingots for use in a variety of ways, including in reactors that make bomb fuel. The plant operated for years with inadequate filters and waste material was dumped into open pits.</p> <p>Fernald has had a history of environmental problems. Most recently, inspectors from the Federal Government and the state of Ohio were withdrawn after a Federal inspector was found to have uranium in her urine following a visit to the plant&#39;s offices. Basic Errors Found</p> <p>Senator Glenn said in his statement that the study of radioactive doses that was undertaken by the Department at his request almost four years ago was stalled because of such basic errors as miscounting the number of exhaust vents from which uranium was released. The Department on Feb. 14 raised its estimate of radioactive releases by 30 percent because it had failed to take account of an exhaust stack where powdered uranium is vacuumed from one container to another.</p> <p>Senator Glenn is the chairman of the Government Affairs Committee, which is conducting an investigation of the Energy Department&#39;s dose studies.</p> <p>A major study is now under way around the Hanford reservation in south-central Washington state, where massive amounts of radioactive iodine were intentionally released in the 1950&#39;s. One difficulty in the study there and the one at Fernald is determining who lived in the area at the time, and tracking those people to subsequent addresses to determine the health effects.</p> <p>Senator Glenn said he was moving to take the the dose study away from the Energy Department because &#39;&#39;it appears that the Department of Energy&#39;s concern over liability has become a major obstacle in finding out potential health risks in Fernald&#39;s operations.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Neighbors of the plant, he added, deserve an estimate of their radiation dose &#39;&#39;by an agency that is not encumbered by a conflict of interest.&#39;&#39; Already Being Sued</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department, Chris Sankey, denied that the fear of a suit is &#39;&#39;the primary concern&#39;&#39; at the Department. In fact, she noted, the Department is already being sued by neighbors. &#39;&#39;We have to deal first and foremost with fixing the plant,&#39;&#39; she said.</p> <p>Under the plan announced by Senator Glenn, the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health will review the existing estimate of uranium releases. A. James Ruttenber, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control, said the data were in question because of previous errors.</p> <p>The Radioactive Waste Campaign in its study, said that in 1954 alone, the dose to the lung for a person living one kilometer north of the plant was more than 20 rems of radiation. The current standard for safety is 75 one-thousandths of a rem a year. A chest X-ray delivers about 10 one-thousandths of a rem.</p> <p>Dr. Marvin Resnikoff, a physicist who is the research director of the campaign, said the study assumed that for each million rems absorbed by the population in the area, 25 to 150 lung cancers would result, plus a smaller number of cancers in other organs.</p> <p>Dr. Ruttenber of the Centers for Disease Control said those estimate were &#39;&#39;within the ballpark,&#39;&#39; but he refused to endorse them entirely. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s pretty easy for anyone nowadays to crank out an estimate of dose, and then an estimate of cancers,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;The real question is whether all of the assumptions are accurate and realistic.&#39;&#39; Contamination of Water</p> <p>These include such factors as the size of the uranium particles and the size of the population exposed, he said.</p> <p>Other factors of uncertainty, said Dr. Resnikoff, include wind speed and the rate at which uranium released decades ago is kicked up and returned to the air as dust. But Dr. Resnikoff, in a telephone interview, called his a group&#39;s assumptions &#39;&#39;conservative&#39;&#39; and said they would tend to understate the dosages.</p> <p>The Radioactive Waste Campaign&#39;s study also said uranium and other radioactive material in waste pits has contaminated the Great Miami Aquifer, a groundwater source under the plant, and that the pits should be emptied. The Department acknowledges that it has contaminated a shallow aquifer, and three wells outside the plant gate, but not that the deeper Great Miami aquifer has been affected.</p> <p>The report also called for scraping away and storing the &#39;&#39;grossly contaminated land&#39;&#39; around the plant.</p>
248505>Governors Assail U.S. Effort To Clean Up Nuclear Waste Expressing their &#39;&#39;concern, frustration and anger,&#39;&#39; the Governors of 10 states wrote the Secretary of Energy yesterday to criticize Federal efforts to clean up pollution at the plants that make nuclear bomb material.  <p>In an unusual bipartisan, effort, the Governors said that public confidence in the Energy Department&#39;s ability to cope with the nuclear pollution problem &#39;&#39;has been seriously eroded.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Government has made a start at cleaning up the effects of 45 years of allowing radioactive and chemical wastes to spread, &#39;&#39;but it remains uncertain whether this work will be completed before more serious and permanent harm is done,&#39;&#39; the Governors wrote.</p> <p>The eight Democrats and two Republicans, in a seven-page cleanup proposal included in the letter, complained that &#39;&#39;there is no firm Federal commitment&#39;&#39; to the cleaning up of all the sites where nuclear pollution is a problem.</p> <p>Summarizing their frustrations with the Government, the Governors wrote: &#39;&#39;Schedules have slipped repeatedly. Generally, U.S. Department of Energy has no milestones or deadlines for completing cleanup work. Funding is far less than needed. Application and enforcement of federal and state laws and regulations are questioned. The role of affected states and tribes is not clear.&#39;&#39; Fear of State Competition</p> <p>The letter was delivered to the Energy Secretary, James D. Watkins, yesterday. A spokesman for the department, Pat White, said late yesterday that officials had seen the letter yet and had no comment.</p> <p>Such a letter, from a large, bipartisan group of Governors on a controversial subject, is unusual, but aides to several Governors said it was prompted by fear that competition would develop among the states for cleanup money.</p> <p>The Governors who initiated it were Richard F. Celeste of Ohio and Booth Gardner of Washington, whose states are among the most heavily contaminated, and Cecil D. Andrus of Idaho, who has recently set limits on the amount of radioactive waste the Department of Energy could bring into his state for storage. Need for Increased Resources</p> <p>The letter was also signed by the Governors of South Carolina, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Tennessee, Oregon and Kentucky, whose states all contain troubled nuclear installations or are affected by present or potential nuclear pollution.</p> <p>Jeffrey P. Breckel, who is employed by Governors Gardner of Washington and Neil Goldschmidt of Oregon as their joint specialist on radioactive wastes from the bomb program, said that all those signing &#39;&#39;realized that they need to increase the resources that are available for cleanup.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But he added that if all the states had to &#39;&#39;compete for a very limited pot of money, there isn&#39;t going to be an effective cleanup in any state.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A central issue is the size and thoroughness of the cleanup. The Governors said that a recent estimate by Congress&#39;s General Accounting office put the cost at $130 billion. They pointed out that only about $975 million was appropriated in the Federal budget for this fiscal year.</p> <p>A House Armed Services subcommittee is scheduled to hear testimony next Tuesday from environmental officials from many of the 10 states concerning how much money is needed.</p> <p>The Governors&#39; proposal for cleaning up the pollution calls for stable, long-term financing; a national ranking of priorities and a schedule; state oversight of the Federal work, with added financing for the states, and increased study of health effects.</p>
1313280>Auditors Doubt Amtrak Will Meet Profit Goal Amtrak is unlikely to meet the date Congress set five years ago to break even or face the possibility of liquidation, two outside auditors told a House subcommittee today. But the head of Amtrak testified that he found the mandate to end the railroad&#39;s losses, while running unprofitable trains at the same time, irrational, frustrating and &#39;&#39;wacky.&#39;&#39;  <p>Amtrak said it anticipated that the slowdown in business travel that had hit the airlines would hit it, too, one of the reasons it was having difficulty meeting operational self-sufficiency.</p> <p>Congress voted in December 1997 to require Amtrak to generate enough profits within five years to meet all operating costs and ordered that if Amtrak failed, a newly formed council should create a plan for restructuring Amtrak, while the General Accounting Office should create a plan for liquidating it.</p> <p>George D. Warrington, president and chief executive of Amtrak, insisted that the railroad was making good progress toward self-sufficiency in operating funds. But Mr. Warrington added that a deeper question was whether Congress would supply capital funding, as anticipated in the 1997 law, and whether it would recognize that some service could not be profitably provided.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I believe we will be very close, even in a downturned economy,&#39;&#39; Mr. Warrington said.</p> <p>The railroad is considering laying off 15 percent of its managers and 10 percent of its unionized personnel.</p> <p>Kenneth Mead, the inspector general of the Department of Transportation, said that the railroad could cut enough to break even but that the cuts would be so draconian that &#39;&#39;such a victory would be hollow and have serious repercussions for the future of intercity passenger rail.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Mead also testified that the new high-speed Acela trains serving Boston, New York and Washington  were lightly used and that the number of seats filled was declining on Boston-to-New York runs. He added, though, that this might simply be because the service was new.</p> <p>Experts differed on the amount by which Amtrak was likely to miss the self-sufficiency goal.</p> <p>JayEtta Z. Hecker, director of physical infrastructure issues at the accounting office, a Congressional agency, said Amtrak had closed the gap between revenues and expenses by only $83 million in the last six years and had $280 million left to go. But Mr. Warrington said about $200 million a year that Amtrak paid for retirement benefits for employees of predecessor railroads did not count.</p> <p>Most members of the subcommittee were friendly to the railroad.</p> <p>Robert A. Borski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, compared Amtrak with the French high-speed train, T.G.V. &#39;&#39;It goes fast, it is smooth, they put a lot of money into it, and we just don&#39;t,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>But Representative John L. Mica, Republican of Florida, berated the railroad for &#39;&#39;half-baked&#39;&#39; efforts, including inadequate terminals at the southern end of the Auto Train in Sanford, Fla.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The future of Amtrak is dismal at best,&#39;&#39; Mr. Mica said, adding that the railroad was &#39;&#39;near death&#39;&#39; and that &#39;&#39;we should begin restructuring and liquidating now.&#39;&#39;</p>
1368968>As U. S. Assumes Screening, Little Will Appear Changed When the federal government takes over responsibility for security at the airports on Sunday, passengers will probably not notice any immediate changes, Transportation Department officials said today. But Argenbright Security, one of the largest contractors, will quickly be eliminated from the passenger screening checkpoints, they added.  <p>Under the aviation security law passed by Congress in November, the new Transportation Security Administration will relieve the airlines of the job of screening passengers and bags at 429 airports. For the next few months, the agency will use some of the contractors who do the work now, but an exception will be Argenbright, which has an extended history of problems, including employing felons.</p> <p>Michael Jackson, the deputy secretary of transportation, said his department would be signing contracts with about 60 security companies in the next few days. The airlines, which currently hire the contractors, will turn that function over to the government on Sunday. Incumbent companies will get 30 days notice of termination, but many are bidding to get the same work from the government.</p> <p>Argenbright will not be hired anywhere, Mr. Jackson said, and will be almost entirely out of the airport security business in &#39;&#39;30 to 40 days.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Soon, the government will begin hiring and training its own employees to do the work, he said, but employees of the contractors who meet federal guidelines, including being American citizens, and who are good at their jobs, will be eagerly welcomed, Mr. Jackson said.</p> <p>John W. Magaw, the under secretary of transportation for security who is head of the Transportation Security Administration, said, &#39;&#39;There&#39;s more jobs here than we have people to fill.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Each screening checkpoint has an airline screening manager on duty. As of Sunday, the government will hire those same managers temporarily, paying the airlines for their services.</p> <p>The government will dispatch 436 people on Friday to acquaint themselves with the airports and begin functioning on Sunday as federal security managers, with oversight for an entire airport. Some airports will have more than one security manager. The department has begun looking for 81 permanent federal security managers, and has had 9,500 applications, Mr. Magaw said.</p> <p>Mr. Jackson said the phased changed was part of a &#39;&#39;deliberately planned, incremental improvement process.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Jackson spoke at a briefing for reporters where Mr. Magaw was asked about a security change being sought by the airlines, the issuance of a &#39;&#39;trusted traveler&#39;&#39; card for their best customers, to qualify them for a faster passage through security. He was not enthusiastic.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There may be a place for it,&#39;&#39; Mr. Magaw said, but he said the checked luggage and carry-on baggage of those passengers would still have to be screened.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You could have a go-fast lane,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>But he added that at airports in Europe where such a system had been tried &#39;&#39;you almost had riots&#39;&#39; among passengers. The fast lanes were then moved to another part of the airport, he said, and hardly anyone used them.</p> <p>Mr. Magaw said that people who wanted such a card would have to submit to background checks, but that there was not much the government would ask &#39;&#39;that&#39;s not already out there.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Magaw also said that his department would hire an ombudsman to accept public complaints about airport security.</p> <p>Asked about a complaint by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, that male screeners were inappropriately patting down female passengers, Mr. Magaw said the practice of having screeners pat down members of the opposite sex had been banned.</p> <p>Mr. Jackson said the department would meet the Dec. 31 deadline to examine all checked bags for bombs. The department had ordered 100 new bag-screening machines from each of the two companies that produce models acceptable to the government to induce them to increase production, he said.</p> <p>The machines are the size of a minivan and cost up to $1 million each. They are so heavy that they sometimes require that floors be rebuilt. It may take 2,200 of them to equip the country&#39;s airport system.</p> <p>The government may meet the deadline by using a smaller, less expensive device, the trace detection system, Mr. Jackson said. These are already familiar to passengers at checkpoints, where screeners use them by rubbing an absorbent pad over hand-carried items and then putting the pad in a detector.</p> <p>A NATION CHALLENGED: AIRPORT SECURITY</p>
579679>Hazards at Nuclear Plant Festering 8 Years After Warning Eight years after Government experts first said that catastrophic explosions were possible at million-gallon waste tanks at a nuclear bomb plant in Washington State, the Department of Energy still does not know just what is in the tanks or how risky they are. The tanks, filled with radioactive waste and toxic chemicals, are the most pressing environmental problem that the Clinton Administration&#39;s Department of Energy will inherit, despite optimistic talk on the campaign trail about energy efficiency and fuels that pollute less.  <p>The problem at the Hanford nuclear reservation, on the outskirts of Richland, Wash., even confounds experts. For example, just last year the department realized it had grossly underestimated the amount of plutonium in the tanks, and it now monitors six tanks to determine if a nuclear reaction is likely. Criticism of Westinghouse</p> <p>One of the most prominent critics of how the tanks are managed has been the Bush Administration official in charge of waste management, Leo P. Duffy. He has criticized the contractor in charge of the cleanup, a subsidiary of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, calling its performance &quot;marginal.&quot;</p> <p>After a review of the six-month period that ended in September, the department gave Westinghouse its lowest marks yet in the five years the company has managed the complex. The bonus payment awarded on the basis of how well the company was performing was cut this month to 45 percent of the maximum available, down from 85 percent in a typical performance review at Hanford.</p> <p>Last month, Mr. Duffy&#39;s office issued a report saying that the department&#39;s field office in Richland, which supervises Westinghouse&#39;s work, &quot;does not have sufficient professional safety and health staff to support the resolution of issues related to the tank farms.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;In spite of repeated findings by internal and external groups,&quot; the report continued, Richland &quot;has been unable to resolve this critical issue.&quot;</p> <p>Some outside experts take a harsher line, saying foot-dragging by Westinghouse on the issue of gas escaping from the tanks borders on the criminal.</p> <p>Morton Corn, a former Assistant Secretary of Labor for occupational safety and health, was asked by Congressional investigators to review the Energy Department&#39;s progress in protecting workers from the dangers posed by the tanks.</p> <p>Now director of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, Mr. Corn wrote in July, &quot;The absence of high priority for solving this problem in 1990 with attendant lack of professional staff and resources could well have put someone on trial for criminal behavior.&quot; The Energy Department and its contractors are exempt from OSHA regulations, but have promised to abide by those rules.  Company Defends Itself</p> <p>Westinghouse adamantly denies the accusations and points out that with careful analytic work, it has managed tasks that were previously impossible, even if elsewhere they would seem modest. For example, for years engineers did not sample the tanks for fear the act of lowering a probe through a crust on the top layer would set off a fire or explosion; recently, two core samples have been taken.</p> <p>The tanks hold liquids left over from the production of plutonium for nuclear weapons. Complicating the problem, in the cold war years technicians added organic chemicals that were meant to make the most radioactive materials sink to the bottom of the tanks in a sludge; the remaining liquids, somewhat less dangerous, were then dumped into the dirt. But the organic chemicals, under intense heat and radiation, are undergoing changes that produce flammable and explosive gases and solids. And because of years of transfers among the tanks, no one is sure how much of each chemical is contained in each tank.</p> <p>Energy Department reports show that 16 times since 1987, including seven times in 1991, workers have been exposed to toxic gas leaking from the tanks, and some have suffered permanent lung damage. A report last month described a serious lapse in safety procedures: a truck operating near a million-gallon tank at the time the tank was expected to &quot;burp&quot; explosive hydrogen gas.</p> <p>In this instance, Mr. Duffy denies that the truck posed much of a hazard. And he says that over the years the department has made substantial progress. Next month, for example, workers plan to install a 12-ton pump in one of the tanks to slowly mix the wastes and allow hydrogen to bleed off instead of &quot;burping.&quot; Mr. Duffy said this would be the first step so far to significantly cut risks.</p> <p>But even he calls the remaining tasks daunting. Preparing the tanks for long-term storage, Mr. Duffy said, will be &quot;the biggest single engineering project anybody has ever worked on, including NASA.&quot;</p> <p>In two years employment has doubled at the tanks, to 1,240. The annual budget, now $500 million, will grow to $1 billion in a few years, engineers say.</p> <p>The problem has been increasingly obvious for years, but progress has been excruciatingly slow; the tanks are like a person prone to heart attack but whose medical attention has consisted of little more than a program of blood pressure checks, with no change in diet or anything else to cut risks.  Mixture of Problems</p> <p>The reasons seem to be a mixture of management troubles and technical challenges that are nearly unique. The only other country with a large-scale waste problem like the Hanford tanks was the Soviet Union, where similar wastes exploded in the southern Ural mountains in the late 1950&#39;s contaminated thousands of square miles.</p> <p>&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s under control,&quot; said Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which has been continuously investigating Hanford and the rest of the weapons production complex for several years. &quot;I can&#39;t say the risks are acceptably low; I can&#39;t say the risks have been improved that much.&quot;</p> <p>The tanks, by all accounts, are the most worrisome part of the Government&#39;s leaking, broken-down complex for producing nuclear weapons. The problem has carried the Energy Department and its contractors into unfamiliar territory, like industrial hygiene. Partly for that reason, President Bush found it hard to staff the department&#39;s policy-level jobs.</p> <p>Soon those officials who have spent the last few years analyzing the problems and organizing resources to attack them will be leaving, and President-elect Bill Clinton will be looking for replacements. He made public his first choice on Tuesday, selecting a Minnesota utility executive, Hazel R. O&#39;Leary, as Energy Secretary.</p> <p>According to internal correspondence, Energy Department reports and outside analysts, the department and Westinghouse still have not determined exactly what is in the 177 tanks, which together hold 57 million gallons (not counting the one million gallons that have leaked from 66 of the tanks), and still have extreme difficulty in sampling operations. Earlier this year one effort to sample gases emitted by the wastes ended when engineers discovered that because of a valving error, their 40 sample canisters were empty.</p> <p>Last month, the Energy Department cited a backlog of 2,000 maintenance items among the 177 tanks, although Mr. Duffy said the current number was down to about 1,000.</p> <p>The origin of the backlog is not the fault of Westinghouse. Years ago, some of the tanks were, in bureaucratic language, &quot;taken out of use,&quot; which means that they were left abandoned behind a fence, monitoring equipment disconnected, but still filled with an unstable brew of chemicals. Now Westinghouse counts it as an achievement that many of the tanks have been hooked up to a computer to chart temperatures and sound an alarm if there is a sudden increase.</p> <p>Westinghouse has done work at the Hanford site since 1970, but since 1987 has been the prime contractor. Bringing in the company, a large organization with wide technical skills, was seen at the time as a step toward remedying the problems created by years of Government neglect and bad moves by previous contractors, including General Electric and Rockwell International.</p> <p>Now Westinghouse says it is moving ahead as fast as possible. Dr. Harry Harmon, vice president for tank waste remediation, said: &quot;The reason that sometimes the progress is viewed as less than adequate in some specific area when an outside review team comes in is that we are trying to make progress on many of these areas at the same time. There are many compelling issues, and we have to place resources on the highest priority items.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;In 1990 when I came here, we were unable to even take a sample from tank 101 SY for fear it was unsafe,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Amid the squabbling, after years of preparation, Westinghouse and the Energy Department are planning to install a 12-ton, 47-foot-long pump in 101-SY next month to circulate the wastes slowly, allowing hydrogen to bleed off continuously instead of in potentially flammable burps. Mr. Duffy said the installation was the first major remedial action, but required years of analysis and planning.  Little Time for Action</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s a trying environment,&quot; he said, pointing out that the work season was 15 days every three to four months. Over the last two and a half years of planning and preparatory work, he said, that comes to only 100 days.</p> <p>Westinghouse insists it is doing its best, though it acknowledges it has a way to go.</p> <p>Tom Anderson, president of Westinghouse Hanford Company, the subsidiary in charge at the reservation, referring to accusations that Westinghouse might have been criminally neglectful of worker safety, said: &quot;We absolutely, absolutely dispute that statement. There is no way we&#39;re negligent in terms of employee safety.&quot;</p> <p>Experts say the question of worker safety and public safety are closely related. Although the tanks are well inside the Hanford reservation, which is 50 percent larger than the five boroughs of New York City, the presence of uncontrolled gases that may be explosive is a bad indication for public safety, experts say.</p> <p>Some of the tanks have a diameter of 75 feet and have temperature measuring devices on a single pole that is lowered into the wastes, so engineers are not sure if there are &quot;hot spots&quot; in the tanks. They also do not know how thoroughly the contents are mixed, which leaves the possibility that even if the average concentration of a combustible material is too low to sustain a fire or explosion, or the average temperature is too low to set one off, there may be higher concentrations or temperatures in smaller areas. Westinghouse has done some work in this area in the last few months, including surveying some wastes with an infrared camera to measure temperature. The company asserts the risk is very low.</p> <p>Two dozen tanks contain ferrocyanides, compounds that pound for pound, the Department of Energy said last year, have about one-quarter the explosive power of TNT. Even if there is no explosion while the wastes are in the tanks, the presence of these compounds complicates the job of getting the wastes out of the tanks and stabilizing them for long-term storage.</p> <p>And the tank conditions are not static. Videotapes made last year inside tank 101-SY, which has a hydrogen problem, show what looks like partly-cooled lava inside a volcano, seething and lurching as it burps noxious and explosive gases that are produced by chemical and nuclear reactions. The shifting wastes splash the walls and bend metal parts; a narrator describes &quot;rollover events&quot; in which the tank agitates itself.</p> <p>Engineers had hoped to install the pump a few months ago during a two-week &quot;window&quot; when they could work in the tank but spent the time instead removing a steel &quot;air lance&quot; that was once used to pump air under the crust to dissipate hydrogen. The lance had been bent by the shifting wastes and engineers were concerned that if it was left it place, it could break off, strike a wall and create a spark.</p> <p>In 1957, a tank holding similar wastes exploded in Kyshtym in the southern Ural mountains, the Soviet Government disclosed in 1989. The announcement set off a broad effort to determine whether the American tanks are similarly dangerous, and in July 1990, an advisory panel to the Department of Energy warned that the tanks &quot;present a serious situation, if not an imminent hazard.&quot; Uncertainty About Chemicals</p> <p>Even now there are questions about the chemical composition of the vapors. Westinghouse is now using four different methods to analyze samples of organic compounds, for example.</p> <p>All these problems relate to keeping the wastes safe in the tanks, which is only part of the task, because in the long term, far more aggressive action must be taken. &quot;In 1948, the Atomic Energy Commission said the single-shelled tanks are going to corrode in 25 years, and they were right, they did,&quot; said Mr. Duffy. Double-shelled tanks built later, like 101-SY, have not leaked yet, but are unsuitable for long-term storage.</p>
1325640>Controllers Say Flow of Information on Hijacked Planes&#39; Course Was Slow and Uneven The controllers assigned to United Airlines Flight 175 on Tuesday suspected that it had been hijacked as it flew off its assigned route. But they did not learn that another plane had been hijacked and had hit the World Trade Center until a minute or two before Flight 175 struck the center, people involved in the air traffic system said. In contrast, controllers at the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center had much more warning that something was wrong. Those controllers, who handled American Airlines Flight 77, which dived into the Pentagon, knew about the hijacking of the first plane to crash, even before it hit the World Trade Center, those involved said. That was more than an hour before they watched another hijacked plane, United Flight 93, cross their radar screen on its way to the Pentagon.  <p>Advance knowledge made no apparent difference in the response; nobody intercepted the plane.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We issue control instructions,&#39;&#39; one controller said. &#39;&#39;Any procedures beyond that point don&#39;t lie with us.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Those procedures would, in fact, lie with the Air Force. The question of giving the Air Force notice of hijackings and authorization to shoot down civilian planes is likely to be a major concern for security officials in the next few days. A spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration said today that there was a policy for when a civilian plane could be shot down, but the agency would not discuss it. The military routinely refuses to disclose its rules of engagement. Nor was it clear today exactly when, or if, the Pentagon was notified on Tuesday.</p> <p>As the crisis took shape, information flowed unevenly within the F.A.A. The agency has broken up air traffic up into sectors small enough for two controllers to handle, and grouped the sectors in different air traffic offices. Such compartmentalization allows the agency to handle several thousand flights simultaneously, but may also have prevented information from flowing quickly enough.</p> <p>The F.A.A. has refused to give details, saying that the way the information flows within the agency is part of the F.B.I.&#39;s investigation into Tuesday&#39;s attacks. But people involved describe a haphazard flow.</p> <p>For example, at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center in Ronkonkoma, which handles long-distance traffic around the New York metropolitan area, the first inkling of a hijacking that most controllers had was when a supervisor came to the cafeteria and asked if he could change the television channel to CNN.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Our TV&#39;s are always tuned to ESPN,&#39;&#39; one controller said.</p> <p>The television screen showed one tower of the World Trade Center with a hole in it. &#39;&#39;We didn&#39;t know what kind, what airplane. There were rumors it was a 737,&#39;&#39; the controller said. &#39;&#39;We said, &#39;No way, it would be a much bigger hole.&#39; We were watching, and we saw the second one go in.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In the darkened, windowless cavern that is the operations floor of the center, most controllers did not learn of the twin hijackings until their colleagues came up from the cafeteria.</p> <p>At the control tower at La Guardia Airport, the first definitive information for controllers was the sight, viewed through binoculars, of the second plane plunging into the building. On the other hand, as soon as controllers in Boston heard that a plane might have hit the World Trade Center, they knew what had become of American Airlines Flight 11, which they had been tracking since it began behaving erratically, people involved said.</p> <p>At the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, the air traffic office whose airspace American Flight 11 entered soon before its crash, a conclusive report of what happened to that plane reached the room only a minute or two before the United plane hit the other tower, controllers there said. &#39;&#39;We had 90 to 120 seconds; it wasn&#39;t any 18 minutes,&#39;&#39; said one controller, referring to the actual elapsed time.</p> <p>Another controller said: &#39;&#39;They dove into the airspace. By the time anybody saw anything, it was over.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>After the two World Trade Center crashes, controllers at the New York traffic center were briefed by their supervisors to watch for airplanes whose speed indicated that they were jets, but which either were not responding to commands or had disabled a surveillance device called a transponder. Controllers in Washington got a similar briefing, which helped them pick out hijacked planes more quickly. Two of the four planes had transponders that had apparently been tampered with in flight.</p> <p>In fact, though, transponder failure is an ambiguous sign, even if the plane then strays from its assigned altitude and course. Controllers do not assume the worst &#39;&#39;if something weird happens with the airplane,&#39;&#39; said one; an electrical problem could be responsible and the pilot might be headed back to the departure airport. Standard procedure is to &#39;&#39;give him room and watch what he does,&#39;&#39; another controller said.</p> <p>Transponders are robot radios, carried in a plane&#39;s tail, that respond to queries from ground-based radar by giving the plane&#39;s identity and altitude. Ground radar can calculate, based on the timing of the transponder response and the direction from which it came, the plane&#39;s latitude and longitude. American Flight 77, which hit the Pentagon, had had its transponder shut off, so controllers had less information on the flight. On United Flight 175, the second plane to hit the World Trade Center, someone changed the code that the transponder was sending, which had the effect of confusing the air traffic control computers. On the controller&#39;s screen, the data block, three lines of letters and numbers that give the plane&#39;s identity and other details, cut loose from the blip and drifted off.</p> <p>Controllers also say they were told to watch for planes heading for Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. Unlike the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Camp David would be hard to spot from the air, but it is clearly marked on charts, because the airspace below 5,000 feet is off limits to civilian planes. But because Camp David is close to Washington and a hijacked plane&#39;s target is unknown, it would be hard to say whether a plane headed toward that location actually intended to go there, controllers noted.</p> <p>AFTER THE ATTACKS: MONITORING THE FLIGHTS</p>
453221>Solar Storm Causes Renewed Disruptions on Earth Waves of charged particles thrown off by the Sun have caused renewed disturbances in Earth&#39;s magnetic field in recent days, disrupting radio communications and apparently disabling power transmission equipment in Virginia. At midday yesterday, a new wave of the particles hit the magnetic field, indicating that &quot;we&#39;re beginning a very disturbed period,&quot; said David Speich, a scientist at the Space Environment Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in Boulder, Colo. His agency predicted that as result of the disturbance the Northern Lights could be visible as far south as Tulsa, Okla.  <p>A round of disturbances, which scientists call geomagnetic storms, began June 4, in response to a disturbance on the Sun three days earlier. Solar flares have sent waves of protons and electrons toward Earth, literally pushing the planet&#39;s magnetic field. When the field moves through Earth&#39;s crust, it generates electric currents, which can jump into power lines and disrupt transmission equipment.</p> <p>The Virginia Electric and Power Company said three capacitor banks failed simultaneously Monday. The capacitors are used to maintain voltage on transmission lines.</p> <p>&quot;It didn&#39;t present any extraordinary problems to us,&quot; said Larry W. Ellis, senior vice president of the power company, because the demand for power was not at a peak.</p> <p>If a geomagnetic storm caused transmission to fail at a time when the system was fully loaded, some experts say a widescale blackout could result.</p> <p>The particles also disrupt the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles. In some kinds of radio transmissions, the ionosphere is used to bounce the signals back toward Earth.</p> <p>In addition, the particles can deliver a radiation dose to passengers on airplanes on trans-polar flights, including most flights from the United States to Europe. As the solar storm changes the shape of the Earth&#39;s magnetic field, the lines of magnetic force that come together at the poles spread slightly, the effect that makes the Northern Lights visible so far south. The particles are drawn to the polar region and, interacting with molecules of the atmosphere or aircraft, can shake loose neutrons, which then irradiate people.</p> <p>By some estimates, the dose on a single flight, especially at high altitude, can be twice as large as for many diagnostic X-rays.</p> <p>If the solar storm intensifies, it could add slightly to the dose of radiation that people on the ground routinely receive from the Sun and other stars.</p> <p>Under normal conditions the Sun sends a continuous stream of particles, called solar wind, but the wave created by the solar disturbances is denser than the normal flow.</p> <p>In addition, while all the particles in both cases are electrically charged, those in the wave are oriented differently from the usual direction, said Joseph Hirman, manager of the Space Environmental Services Center in Boulder. The result of the wave, he said, is to push Earth&#39;s magnetic field.</p> <p>Solar wind travels at about one million miles an hour, Mr. Hirman said, but the waves can move four or five times faster. They reach Earth in 18 hours to 4 days.</p> <p>Solar activity runs in cycles of roughly 11 years, and scientists believe that the Sun is at or past its peak for this cycle. The current disturbances are the most severe since 1989.</p>
497626>Weak Russian Economy May Use Less Oil Experts once feared that the Soviet Union would stop exporting oil because of declining production, but now many think that economic collapse will cut internal demand as fast or faster, leaving a margin for Russian exports, a crucial factor in the world&#39;s balance between supply and demand. For two years experts have feared that the strife in the Soviet Union, the world&#39;s largest oil producer, would turn that country from an exporter to an importer, increasing the power of Middle East suppliers and forcing up prices around the globe. But now some experts argue that an unprecedented economic decline may push down demand in the new Commonwealth of Independent States even more than supply falls.  <p>In addition, they say, the post-Communist economy, no matter what its size, seems likely to use less energy for each unit of economic output. Output Going Down</p> <p>Soviet oil production slipped slightly in the last few years, and gross national product, which declined 4 percent in 1990, has fallen 12 percent or more this year, experts say. But more drastic changes are ahead, especially in the parts of the economy that use large amounts of energy.</p> <p>Thane Gustafson, who is currently on leave from Georgetown University, where he is director of the Soviet studies program, says the former Soviet Union &quot;is on a track that could see its G.N.P. fall on the order of 50 percent over the period 1989 to 1995.&quot; That would reduce energy demand about 30 percent, or 10 million barrels a day, he said, although some of the lost demand would be for natural gas and coal.</p> <p>Dr. Gustafson, who returned earlier this week from visiting the oilfields of western Siberia, wrote a recent book on Soviet energy policy, and is now with Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an influential consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. He wrote in a report sent to clients this week that &quot;the economic consequences of such a slump could be a major export onslaught of Soviet commodities, including energy.&quot;</p> <p>Oil producers have a special incentive to export, he said in a telephone interview, because the internal price is only about 65 cents a ton. A ton, the traditional Soviet measure of oil, is about 7.3 barrels, so at the current world price of about $18 a barrel, one barrel exported brings as much revenue as 200 barrels sold internally.</p> <p>Product exports might also increase, he said, as the internal economy declines. For example, he said, Aeroflot, the airline, &quot;had been run as a kind of Greyhound of the people.&quot; But if it had to raise fares to market levels, he said, its flights would be cut 90 percent, and the unused jet fuel would be sold.</p> <p>Over all, Dr. Gustafson predicts, exports will decline but not disappear, partly because oil is one of the few commodities that could provide the capital the country so desperately needs. Several refineries have found new markets in the West and new transportation routes for their products, he said, and have shown great creativity in arranging exports to earn hard currency. No Quick Turnaround Seen</p> <p>Another consulting firm, the Petroleum Industry Research Associates, predicts the G.N.P. will decline 35 percent from 1990 to 1995, before the economy begins to grow again. Oil exports will be steady or may even increase, Gary N. Ross, president of the firm, said. His group, which is based in New York and has clients in 15 countries, predicted that oil use would fall two million barrels a day -- an amount equivalent to production from Alaska&#39;s North Slope -- before bottoming out in the middle of this decade.</p> <p>Exports will be roughly flat for the next few years, &quot;with modest growth after 1995, but with probably more upside potential than downside,&quot; his group&#39;s report said, adding that it was &quot;a frustrating profile for OPEC after the last two years&#39; declines.&quot;</p> <p>At the United States Department of Energy, Lee Schipper, an energy analyst at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the author of several studies on Soviet energy consumption, said, &quot;The drop in energy use will be fast enough to allow them to maintain their exports.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I didn&#39;t think that even six months ago,&quot; Dr. Schipper said, adding that there is risk in any prediction about the area that used to comprise the Soviet Union. But economic activity is declining sharply, he said.</p> <p>And the activity that replaces the old economy will use less energy, the experts say. Dr. Gustafson pointed to estimates that the Soviet military swallowed 60 percent of the &quot;metal bashing industries,&quot; to make tanks and other heavy equipment; much of that, he said, will disappear.</p> <p>Likewise, he said, ministries built huge buildings to house bloated bureaucracies, and in an economy where raw materials, when they were available, were essentially free, the buildings &quot;were always built heavy, never economized on the use of materials, and were built in a way that leaked energy.&quot;</p> <p>New buildings, to the extent that they are built, will be more efficient, he said. Likewise, &quot;pioneering&quot; Soviet developments, like the Baikal-Amur Mainline railroad, vast irrigation networks and &quot;endless Siberian projects&quot; are probably a thing of the past, he said.</p> <p>Dr. Schipper pointed to other places where consumption would decline. &quot;They won&#39;t drive as much, which will save on gasoline,&quot; he said. &quot;They will probably waste a lot less fuel in trucking, because there just isn&#39;t that much to send around.&quot; Still, he said, some processes will become less efficient, with consumption falling less than overall economic production, because factories will be kept open and their boilers will continue consuming fuel, even if they nearly stop producing goods.</p> <p>Significantly for Western Europe, both reports predict a huge surplus of natural gas in the former Soviet Union, as the domestic demand dries up. Petroleum Industry Research Associates put the figure at seven trillion cubic feet a year, which, it noted, is four times as much as is currently exported to Western Europe.</p> <p>COMPANY NEWS</p>
561279>Nuclear Plants Held Hostage to Old Fuel The long delay in finding a place to dispose of nuclear wastes is about to collide with the accelerated pace at which the reactors are being retired. Owners of several aging nuclear complexes are already keeping parts of their plants running for lack of a place to dump the highly radioactive spent fuel, and many more are likely to follow. The cost of doing so could go up to $20 million a year each if the Government cannot keep its promise to take old fuel by 1998.  <p>The owners of the 31-year-old Yankee Rowe plant in western Massachusetts, which was shut down earlier this year, put the problem in stark relief this week, when they asked that their wastes be taken before that of other plants. &quot;We&#39;re hoping to force the issue,&quot; William McGee, a spokesman at Yankee Rowe, said this week. 35 Years&#39; Worth of Fuel</p> <p>When plants come to an end of their economically useful life, the owners want to seal or raze them. But if the fuel is still there, they must maintain the plants&#39; miles of plumbing and wiring, valves and heat exchangers. Moreover, they must man the control rooms 24 hours a day simply to monitor the deep pools of water that hold the spent fuel. The old fuel contains most of the radioactivity that the plants produced in their lifetimes.</p> <p>Nearly all the nuclear fuel consumed in the 35-year history of the civilian nuclear program is still stored next to the reactors that used it. The pools were not intended for long-term storage, but they can be adapted to hold the waste relatively easily while the plants are running.</p> <p>At Yankee Rowe, for example, the Department of Energy is supposed to begin picking up spent fuel on Jan. 31, 1998, the date established by a 1982 law. But even if pickups start on time -- and Yankee Rowe officials and experts in the nuclear industry question whether that will happen -- they are not scheduled to finish until 2018.</p> <p>&quot;This is unacceptable to us,&quot; Mr.  McGee said.</p> <p>If the rest of the plant is shut down, then operating the spent fuel pool will cost $3 million a year, he added. So earlier this week the plant asked to be moved to the head of the line for pickup. The Government now plans to take the oldest fuel first. Some of Yankee Rowe&#39;s fuel is among the oldest in the country, but some was used as recently as 1991.  Expensive Alternatives</p> <p>The department, however, would face opposition from other utilities if it strayed from the current schedule and has given no indication that it will change it. Worse, it has hinted that it may not even be ready to help Yankee Row by 1998.</p> <p>There are alternatives to store the fuel. If the fuel is old enough, it can be put in casks made of concrete and steel and cooled by natural air circulation, vastly reducing the level of attention and maintenance needed. But doing that at Yankee Rowe would cost $57 million, Mr. McGee said.</p> <p>Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the utilities have been paying a tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour produced by the reactors to finance a repository. In exchange, the Energy Department was to begin picking up waste on Jan. 31, 1998.</p> <p>But the law envisioned the waste going straight to a permanent repository, and the Energy Department&#39;s efforts to establish one have been severely set back by technical problems and local political opposition. A 1987 amendment to the waste law designated Yucca Mountain, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nev., on the edge of the department&#39;s nuclear bomb test range, as the site of the repository. But the department has made little progress in determining whether the site is suitable.</p> <p>The law also allows for the establishment of a &quot;monitored retrievable storage facility,&quot; essentially a fenced-in parking lot for casks. Presumably that could be built quickly, but so far no communities have volunteered to play host. Twenty towns, counties and Indian tribes applied for $100,000 grants from the department to study the feasibility of accepting an interim dump, but four later withdrew. One, Fremont County, Wyo., expressed some enthusiasm, but Gov. Mike Sullivan of Wyoming stepped in recently to block the process.</p> <p>If the Energy Department misses the 1998 deadline, utilities may sue.  &quot;We believe the Department of energy has a financial obligation,&quot; Mr. McGee said. &quot;We have already paid over $23 million into the fund.&quot;</p> <p>Yankee Rowe, a small plant owned by a consortium of New England utilities, is an extreme case because it is a single-reactor plant. Southern California Edison plans to close its San Onofre 1 reactor soon, but the extra cost would be smaller because the company has two other reactors operating. But Yankee Rowe will not be alone in its problem, said Paul C. Parshley, senior vice president of Lehman Brothers, who has followed the nuclear industry for years.  Decisions Being Put Off</p> <p>&quot;We have a number of plants that are going to shut down early,&quot; he said. &quot;At the same time the decision to site and build a Federal repository is slipping further into the future.&quot; Some utilities, he said, are beginning to consider delaying decommissioning to wait for the Department of Energy to find a place to put the fuel.</p> <p>Steven P. Kraft, director of nuclear waste and transportation at the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group based in Washington, said the costs could run to $20 million a year for each reactor. If a utility has to pay out money because of delays beyond 1998 by the Department of Energy, he said, &quot;there&#39;s no question in my mind that they should seek recovery from the Department of Energy.&quot;</p> <p>In Minnesota, where Northern States Power has run into difficulty trying to establish an alternative way to dispose of the fuel, the state&#39;s consumer advocate in utility matters, David Sampsel, said: &quot;Northern States Power and the State of Minnesota were relying on the Department of Energy. We went into the nuclear power business relying on their assurances that the D.O.E. would have a repository for spent nuclear fuel.&quot;</p>
1545064>Under Rules, Train Whistles Will Lose Some of Their Blare The distant whistle of a passing train is about to get a little more distant. The Federal Railroad Administration on Wednesday announced the first limit on how loud a whistle can be and set a procedure for towns to set up &#39;&#39;quiet zones.&#39;&#39;  <p>Allan Rutter, administrator of the agency, said the proposed rule resulted from a collision of suburban growth and a rise in rail traffic.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;People find themselves adjacent to busier railroads, that&#39;s where the conflict comes,&#39;&#39; Mr. Rutter said. He said his grandmother in the Texas Panhandle lives within earshot of a line that carries 80 trains a day.</p> <p>Bill Withuhn, the curator of transportation at the Smithsonian&#39;s National Museum of American History, said, &#39;&#39;The lonesome train whistle is not so lonesome anymore.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The museum has just opened a new exhibit on transportation, which includes a celebration of train whistles. But Mr. Withuhn agreed that the whistle could go from romantic to annoying. &#39;&#39;Airplanes are romantic, too, but in small doses,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Mr. Rutter said that 9.3 million people were &#39;&#39;affected in some way by train horn noise&#39;&#39; and that the rule would cut the number by 3.4 million.</p> <p>Train engineers sound their whistles mostly when they approach roads at grade-level crossings, of which the United States has more than 150,000. Towns and cities have banned whistles at about 2,000 crossings, and in 1996, Congress called for uniform standards for such bans. Mr. Rutter said it took years to come up with them because there had to be a way to balance peace and quiet against the death toll at grade crossings, which last year was nearly 400.</p> <p>The 500-page &#39;&#39;interim final rule&#39;&#39; is still subject to a 60-day public comment period and would come into force a year from now.</p> <p>One provision will limit volume to 110 decibels, compared with the 120 decibels of some whistles now in service. The minimum since 1980 has been 96 decibels, and whistles must still be loud enough to be heard in a car with the windows rolled up and the air conditioner running.</p> <p>Also, engineers will blow their horns 15 to 20 seconds before reaching a crossing. They now must sound the horn a quarter-mile from a crossing, which for a slow-moving train can be much longer than 20 seconds.</p> <p>For those living near the tracks, that is probably still long enough to &#39;&#39;hear the whistle blowing, rise up so early in the morn.&#39;&#39;</p>
836497>What&#39;s the Buzz? G.M.&#39;s Electric Car Is Headed to Showrooms ELECTRIC cars produced by a brand-name auto company, complete with warranty and dealer service, are just a few months away. But the EV1, the two-seater from the General Motors Corporation, will cost roughly $35,000, almost as much as a Corvette and a little more than two Saturns. At that price, who is going to want one? Probably not someone who is comparing it to the Corvette or the Saturns, according to G.M.&#39;s Saturn division, which will sell them. There is no car to compare it to, contended John J. Orth, director of consumer marketing at Saturn. &quot;It&#39;s just a totally new category,&quot; he said.  <p>In fact, people who would consider buying an electric car may want the EV1,  which stands for Electric Vehicle 1, not so much because they want a car but because they want to try something new, he said. The buyers will be &quot;the same people who bought the first Macintosh&quot; or, for that matter, the Model T.</p> <p>When the Apple Macintosh computer was introduced, hardly any buyers could claim they really needed it. But it was one of the first successful entries in a new industry, and G.M. hopes the EV1 will be the same.</p> <p>G.M. plans to offer the car only in Southern California and Arizona. The company says the energy requirements of heating, which would reduce the range of the car, make the EV1 impractical in colder climates, at least as it is currently designed. Ford and Chrysler have also promised to sell electrics, but  those vehicles will most likely end up in companies&#39; fleets, not homeowners&#39; driveways.</p> <p>So what do buyers get in the $35,000 EV1, beyond a vehicle that carries only  two people and must stop and recharge for two hours or more after driving 70 to  90 miles?</p> <p>Ownership gives the right to feel good about helping to clean up the air, although the car is not pollution free. The electricity used to charge the battery will mean some additional contribution to smog and global warming, although not as great as from the carbon dioxide emitted from a Saturn or Corvette. Still, a hard-core clean-air fan would do better to use a bus, a car pool or a bicycle.</p> <p>But the EV1 also gives a different driving sensation: swift, silent and vibration free. It is almost as different from an internal-combustion car as a computer is from a typewriter.</p> <p>If feel isn&#39;t enough, there are more quantifiable benefits, like the maintenance schedule: there isn&#39;t one.</p> <p>The EV1 has no oil to change, or air filters, spark plugs or fan belts. As owners of older, conventional cars could come to appreciate, the EV1 also has no timing belt to replace, no muffler to rust, no fuel injector to clean, no clutch or transmission linkage to wear out and no fuel line to freeze (although  cold can limit range). There are brakes, but it would be hard to wear them out because much of the deceleration is provided by the electric motor, which can also function as a generator, turning unwanted momentum back into electric power for the batteries.</p> <p>Maintenance expenses for the first three years, during which the average person would drive 36,000 miles, are expected to be $80, mostly for odds and ends like windshield-washer fluid, wiper blades and power-steering fluid.</p> <p>The big expense waiting for the owners is replacing the batteries, which at some point -- no one knows when, although likely within 36,000 miles -- will no  longer hold a charge. Replacements could cost about $2,000. In contrast, maintaining a conventional car over three years would cost about $1,000.</p> <p>Range may not be much of a problem because buyers are unlikely to use the two-seat EV1 as a family car. According to census data, 20 percent of all households have three or more cars, meaning that they already have a family car. And even in households with only two adults -- 53.4 million in 1990 -- one in five also has three or more cars, so there may be a market among people who would like to choose a different car to drive every time they step into the driveway.</p> <p>And there are no visits to the gas station, only overnight rechargings, probably in the garage or carport. The energy cost for 36,000 miles is $736 at 6.5 cents a kilowatt-hour. Going that far on gasoline at $1.15 a gallon in a car that gets 27.5 miles a gallon, the national average, would cost $1,500.</p> <p>But offset against this is the cost of a charger. The car comes with a 110-volt model, about the size and heft of a five-gallon gasoline can, but most  buyers will want the 220-volt kind that charges the car faster and mounts on the garage wall or sits on the floor. As with the car, the price has not been set but will probably be around $2,000.</p> <p>When G.M. set about to develop the car, California was planning to require that 2 percent of the company&#39;s sales in that state be electric. Meeting that quota would have required a more popularly priced car. But California has withdrawn the quota and G.M. is free to offer the car at a price that maximizes  its profits. It is also doing so in Arizona, a state that had never planned to require electric cars, but where G.M. evidently believes it can make money.</p> <p>How much will consumers pay? The Ecoelectric Corporation, a company in Tucson, Ariz., that converts Chevrolet S-10 pickups to electricity, charges about $30,000 for its truck, a $17,000 premium over the gasoline-powered version. G.M. arrived at its price after lending prototypes of the EV1 to 500 families for two to four weeks each, accumulating a total of 370,000 miles. G.M. then tested the families&#39; reaction to the car at a variety of different &quot;price points.&quot; In the mid $30,000&#39;s, Mr. Orth said, &quot;people thought you got a good value.&quot;</p> <p>Some states offer tax benefits that may lower the cost a bit. The Federal Government offers a 10 percent tax credit, and in Los Angeles, the South Coast Air Quality Management District plans to offer a $5,000 rebate to the first 1,200 buyers of electric cars. Some other states also offer incentives.</p> <p>If $35,000 seems a little rich, or the product a little too exotic to buy, G.M. says it is considering offering leases, at $450 to $600 a month (again, not much different from two Saturns). Leasing takes the long-term risk out of the driver&#39;s hands and is an easy way to get a toe in the water, said Robert R. Tripolsky, a spokesman for Saturn.</p> <p>He pointed out that leasing was not unusual. In 1995, about 29 percent of all cars, vans and light trucks sold in this country were leased, and the proportion rose with the price of the car, he said.</p> <p>If the sales price seems too steep, waiting might be a good strategy. As with the Macintosh, mass production and technical advances may lower the price. And as with camcorders and other modern electronic devices, competition and invention may lead to lower prices and more features.</p> <p>SPENDING IT</p>
243990>Drilling Plan Points Up Questions On Oil and Wilderness in Alaska Here at the north coast of the North American continent, where the dividing line between frozen tundra and frozen sea is covered by an unbroken blanket of snow, a vast industrial development squats incongruously in the nearly featureless landscape. It is America&#39;s largest oilfield, with a strategic importance that is tremendous but an environmental effect that has not been gauged.  <p>The North Slope is the source of a quarter of the nation&#39;s oil, with a market value of more than $15 billion a year at current prices, but the industry says new exploration is needed to maintain production.</p> <p>Even after the spill from the tanker Exxon Valdez 800 miles away at the other end of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the oil industry considers the North Slope a showcase of environmental consciousness and a demonstration of why drilling should be allowed in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 60 miles to the east. Poisoned Tundra Seen</p> <p>To environmentalists, however, the North Slope is a horror of poisoned tundra and industrial debris in a wild, beautiful and fragile setting, the home for animals like the caribou, which provide food and a way of life for thousands of people born here.</p> <p>And to scientists, the slope is a place of unanswered questions. More than 20 years after oil was discovered, there are clear signs of environmental damage, but its significance for the caribou, birds and tundra is hard to interpret.</p> <p>To say the terrain is unique is to understate its difference from the temperate zone. For example, with precipitation probably under 10 inches a year it is technically a desert. But water cannot seep into the always-frozen layer that begins a foot or two beneath the surface, making the area also a wetland.</p> <p>So little is known about the natural state of things here that scientists cannot address the effects of the drilling on animals. &#39;&#39;We have a virtual lack of base line,&#39;&#39; said Paul Gertler, director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in Fairbanks.</p> <p>But he added, &#39;&#39;We have lost a lot of habitat.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Among the man-made structures covered by snow throughout the 800 square miles of heavy industrial development are hundreds of waste pits filled with hydrocarbons and lead and other toxic metals produced in drilling. The pits have unexpectedly leaked across the flat tundra in the annual spring thaw. Waste Once Sprayed on Roads</p> <p>In earlier years, water from the waste pools was deliberately removed and sprayed on the gravel roads in the oilfield in a well-intentioned effort to control dust that spread contamination further. With experience, the industry has stopped that practice and tries to prevent melting snow from pushing contaminants out of the pits. Engineers are also installing impermeable dikes, replacing those made of gravel.</p> <p>The terrain is vulnerable to the contaminants already brought to the surface and spreading from the pits. Brad Fristoe, manager of the North Slope District Office of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, said, &#39;&#39;Wherever we have a contamination problem, we have a real problem, with low levels of contamination all over.&#39;&#39; When the thaw comes in the late spring, he said, &#39;&#39;the land is so flat, you get water everywhere.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Presumably as a result of the contamination, a decrease in the abundance and diversity of tiny freshwater animals near the bottom of the food chain has been measured by Government scientists. Fluorescent Pink Polar Bear</p> <p>Occasionally, incidents of contamination are dramatic, like the discovery last year of a dead polar bear stained fluorescent pink by industrial poison. The bear appeared to have drunk a mixture of ethylene glycol, an antifreeze, and rhodamine-B, a pink dye. An industry study found that Arco Alaska Inc. used the dye to mark the center line of its aircraft runways but that it did not mix the chemicals; their source is still unknown.</p> <p>The oil companies, intent on expanding the drilling fields into the wildlife refuge, assert that their record is good and improving and that the 20 years of exploration and development has had little effect on the environment.</p> <p>The official record largely supports them, but twice now, draft reports by Federal officials here that purport to show environmental damage have been rewritten in Washington to eliminate that conclusion. Web of Cause and Effect</p> <p>That pattern is a longstanding one here, pipeline opponents say. When the pipeline was undergoing approval environmentalists said in the early 1970&#39;s that it did not meet the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, but Congress blocked any delay by simply voting to stipulate that the pipeline was in compliance.</p> <p>Now, as expansion of the drilling is an issue, scientists deal with a snarled web of possible cause and effect. For example, the caribou are still poorly understood. They were always thought to be split among three herds, but since the animals came under study after the pipeline was proposed, scientists have discovered that there are four. Keeping Track of Caribou</p> <p>The number of caribou has risen substantially in the last few years, a point made frequently by the oil industry. But according to Ray D. Cameron, a game biologist with the state, the question is more subtle.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Most of the wolves were shot out of there in 1977-78,&#39;&#39; he said. The reason, most likely, is that the Aleyska Pipeline Service Company, the consortium of seven oil companies that built the pipeline and an adjacent road, allowed hunting guides to haul aircraft fuel up the road. That permitted refueling, and hunting in areas that were previously inaccessible, leading to a decrease in the number of wolves that prey on caribou.</p> <p>Dr. Cameron is engaged in a long-term study to determine the effect of new oil development on caribou movements. Researchers already know that females are less apt than males to cross the pipeline and road, but have not drawn a conclusion from the finding. Extrapolation to the wildlife refuge is complicated because the Central Arctic herd, biologists now believe, migrates mostly north and south, parallel to the pipeline. The Porcupine herd, which calves on the coastal plain of the refuge, migrates mostly east and west, in an area that would cross a new pipeline. Debate Over Causeways</p> <p>Another pressing concern is whether the gravel causeways to drilling sites miles out in the Beaufort Sea change the environment around the mouths of rivers, where the water is warmer and less salty. The Army Corps of Engineers says the Endicott Causeway has done so at the mouth of the Sagavanirktok River, with a resulting loss of living space for fish that move between fresh and salt water; it wants B.P. Exploration, a subsidiary of the British Petroleum Company, to remove part of the gravel bar and install bridges instead.</p> <p>Still, the catastrophes that were most feared when construction was considered have not occurred. Earthquakes or melted permafrost have not led to breaks in the line, and spills along the pipeline have been very small. &#39;&#39;We have shipped 6.8 billion barrels of oil without significant incident in the 12 years of operation,&#39;&#39; said Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute in Washington. Wider &#39;Sphere of Influence&#39;</p> <p>The industry also stresses that in the vastness of Alaska, an area more than twice the size of Texas, the amount of space taken by development is minuscule. Of the 19-million-acre refuge, the company would like to drill and use less than one percent of its 1.5-million-acre coastal plain.</p> <p>But according to the Office of Technology Assessment, a Congressional research agency, &#39;&#39;the physical coverage would be spread out somewhat like a spider web, and some further physical effects, like infiltration of road dust and changes in drainage patterns, will spread out from the land actually covered.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The &#39;&#39;sphere of influence&#39;&#39; affecting sensitive species, the technology office said in a report last year, would be 30 to 40 times larger than the &#39;&#39;footprint&#39;&#39; of the development itself. Restoring Wilderness</p> <p>A crucial question is how close the engineers can come to restoring virgin wilderness in the refuge if it is drilled and at Prudhoe Bay as the field is exhausted in coming decades, Last summer, B.P. began its first large-scale experiment in restoration, removing gravel that had been the pad for a cluster of oil wells. Workers will seed it this summer to try to redevelop the mix of lichens, flowers and grasses that covered the tundra before oil was discovered.</p> <p>In the extreme cold, thin soil and limited sunlight, recovery is uncertain. But the oil companies face another problem: what to do about the tundra areas that have been killed by salt water pumped up in drilling.</p> <p>The wells were drilled without a plan for restoration; the oil companies and the state are now writing one. This makes it hard to judge the impact on the wildlife refuge. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s nothing to compare to what it&#39;s ultimately going to look like,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Fristoe, the Alaska conservation official. &#39;&#39;They don&#39;t have any finished oilfields.&#39;&#39;</p>
459190>Ideas &amp; Trends; Just How Bad Is the Air Over Kuwait? FOUR months after the retreating Iraqis torched Kuwait&#39;s oil wells, the job of putting them out is bringing slow progress and bitter recriminations. So is the job of assessing the environmental damage. Thus far the United States Government has looked at the smoke as if it were over Pittsburgh, evaluating the pollution by the yardsticks of the Clean Air Act: ozone, carbon monoxide, acid rain and small particulates. Environmental advocates complain that the questions more important to this particular kind of pollution have gone unanalyzed so far -- the carcinogens in unburned and partially burned oil, and the great clouds of big soot particles, the ones that are too big to pose much danger to human lungs but might change the climate.  <p>One result is that nearly all the troops will be long gone before the scientists figure out how dangerous their stay was, and many Kuwaitis will be home from exile before their country&#39;s air is analyzed. The issue will persist with the fires, and fewer than a third of the 625 have been extinguished thus far.</p> <p>But even in what scientists think they know, there are contradictions and incongruities. In early June two teams flew through the plumes but came out with markedly different results. A National Science Foundation team was astonished to find smoke so thick that its plane got zebra stripes of oil on it, but said the environmental damage was only a &quot;concern,&quot; not a crisis; the Friends of the Earth said Washington was fiddling while Kuwait burned and things were getting worse. Calling It From 20,000 Feet</p> <p>Both groups were handicapped because they tried to call the scene from 20,000 feet, but this became obvious only indirectly. At a briefing last month in Washington, the science foundation team described sitting around over beers debating why some smoke was white. A skeptical CNN correspondent asked where they had found beer, since Kuwait is dry. It turned out that the team had been based in Bahrain, off the Saudi coast, and never set foot in Kuwait, settling for the turboprop tour.</p> <p>The Friends of the Earth group asserted that the situation was deteriorating and, to prove it, said pools of oil on the ground were beginning to catch fire. In fact, the pools have been burning intermittently; five men died in one in April. Oil experts say the pools become less flammable as they age, because the chemicals in crude oil that are easiest to light tend to evaporate first.</p> <p>But the observations of the rival teams do raise questions. One: just what is the white smoke? Oil experts here and in Kuwait say it must be steam from water that comes up from deep underground with the oil and boils near the fires. But the National Science Foundation&#39;s instruments found no water vapor in the plumes. Several scientists in that group concluded that it was light oil molecules turned to gas by the heat of the fire and later re-condensed into droplets.</p> <p>The Friends of the Earth team offered yet another theory: that it is water, but not water coming up out of the well. Rather, said Adam Trombly, a physicist and climatologist with the Aspen Institute for Advanced Studies, the ground is being cracked open by the disaster.  With no valves on top of them, the wells, which go as far as two miles down, are now handling more oil than they were designed for and are vibrating, creating fissures through which water and steam are shooting.</p> <p>That would presumably make the flow from underground harder to staunch. But it is less clear to oil men how cracks in the desert add up to environmental disaster. &quot;If it&#39;s true, so what?&quot; asked one oil expert at a company that does business in the Persian Gulf.</p> <p>The analysis thus far, from the National Science Foundation team and Environmental Protection Agency scientists who visited earlier, has mostly covered the garden-variety pollutants. But the pollutants that are mostly peculiar to Kuwait -- a class of carcinogens called poly-aromatic hydrocarbons, from unburned and partially burned oil -- still await measurement.</p> <p>Meanwhile, many scientists have measured the pollution in its most obvious form, great clouds of smoke, but disagree as to what it means and on what to do, other than capping wells faster. Some Americans have criticized the Kuwaitis for insisting on competitive bids on essential fire-fighting equipment, while $100 million a day in oil leaked or burned, but apart from suggesting more help be hired, few have offered plans.</p> <p>Politics, or the suspicion of politics, underlies the dispute. Friends of the Earth maintains that the Bush Administration is playing down the environmental damage so as not to detract from the glitter of victory parades. They said the plume had risen to thousands of feet, far higher than the few hundred that Government scientists had first predicted. The science foundation said the plume had reached 22,000 feet, but maintained that this was far too low to cause climatic change. The Foundation&#39;s trip was paid for in part by the Defense Department, for research into the likelihood of a &quot;nuclear winter&quot; brought on by fires ignited by nuclear war.</p> <p>The two reports were, in effect, a declaration by environmentalists that the situation is halfway to catastrophe, and an assurance by Government-sponsored scientists that things would have to get twice as bad before there was a serious problem.</p>
501376>Car Rentals Hide Welcome Mat In a market too competitive to permit higher rates or an easy increase in market share, two car rental companies have been driven to extremes in trying to improve profitability: turning away the customers most likely to cost them money. Alamo Rent a Car Inc. says people who rent cars in their hometowns have a far higher rate of accidents and loss than those who rent while traveling. That is because business customers on the road are generally safer, and because people who rent a car with the intention of selling it or sub-renting it for profit usually do so locally.  <p>So the company announced on Monday that &quot;local renters&quot; in 10 cities who want big cars would have to apply for a &quot;safe driver&quot; card. They will have to give Alamo permission to examine motor vehicle department records for violations; drivers with a moving violation in the last 24 months cannot rent. Hertz Imposes Surcharges</p> <p>Earlier this month, the Hertz Corporation, which has the largest market share, began imposing surcharges on residents of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens who rent in the New York area; the biggest surcharge, $54 a day for Bronx residents, would double the cost of most rentals. Hertz said each surcharge was based on damage claims it had paid in accidents involving drivers from the borough, divided by the number of renters from that borough.  The effect of Hertz&#39;s and Alamo&#39;s policies is to steer to other companies the people who are deemed more likely to damage cars or hurt other people. For the moment, at least, the others are waiting to see how this goes over with the public and government officials; a spokesman for Avis Inc., with an eyebrow raised so high it was nearly perceptible over the telephone, said it would be wrong to discriminate against drivers by geographic location, as Hertz was discovering from the ensuing bad publicity.</p> <p>Rental car companies complain that some people drive the cars as if there were a lot full of them available if one got smashed. Other people rent more than one car and sub-rent them to under-age drivers. Or they report them as stolen while stripping them to sell the parts or using them as jitneys. When a renter reports a car stolen but has a hand in its disappearance, it is known in the industry as a &quot;conversion.&quot;</p> <p>Such incidents are particularly common in certain areas. Hertz said that of the 1,000 of its cars reported stolen nationwide last year, 700 were in New York City. Nationally, 25 percent were conversions, the company believes, but the proportion was probably higher in New York.  Hertz also said its expenses in &quot;vicarious liability&quot; cases -- suits brought against it by people injured by Hertz-owned cars -- run about $20 million a year nationally, three-quarters of that from cars rented in New York, which is among 10 states with such laws. And half of the damage in New York comes from the 1 percent of New York City renters who live in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. In other words, the problem is local people -- by a huge margin.</p> <p>Some of the damage is from negligence or bad luck, and some is from criminal activity. There are criminal renters all over, said Liz Clark, a spokeswoman for Alamo, but more often than not they are &quot;locals.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;People don&#39;t get on an airplane to rent a car to commit a crime,&quot; she said.</p> <p>Alamo said it had put its program into effect immediately in 10 cities: Birmingham, Ala.; Boston; Hartford; at both major airports in Houston; Memphis; Milwaukee; Newark; Norfolk, Va.; Philadelphia, and at National Airport in Washington. With the exception of Boston, renters will have to pay an extra $10 with their applications, which will take a week to process. Alamo does not rent in New York City.</p> <p>Alamo said it would require local renters who want a four-wheel-drive vehicle, a Cadillac or another costly car to sign a form a week in advance to permit the company to check their driving records. Those with moving violations in the last 24 months will be turned away. The theory is that people who commit crimes are more likely to want big cars, and to have moving violations on their records.</p> <p>Hertz said its problem was vicarious liability, in which a renter causes an accident and the victims sue Hertz. Alamo said the problem was both damage to the cars themselves and liability for injuries. The company recently paid more than $7 million to settle such a suit, involving a British sailor who rented a car and took three shipmates on a trip around Florida. The renter and two of the passengers were killed in a one-car accident, and the fourth sailor, who was permanently disabled, sued Alamo.</p> <p>While the companies&#39; new tactics of exclusion differ, both are a symptom of a bigger battle: too many competitors in the car rental business are scrambling for shrinking revenue. Travel is down, with corporations cutting back on travel budgets or simply laying off the white-collar workers who used to travel.</p> <p>Competition for the remaining customers is fierce. Published rates have not moved much in the last few years. Companies with big travel budgets routinely win discounts from the published rates, generally 20 percent but sometimes much more. After taking a recent survey, Runzheimer International, a Chicago-based travel consulting firm, concluded that a quarter of corporations receive a discount of more than 35 percent and that average daily car rates paid by corporate renters had fallen from about $38 in 1987 to about $35.50 last year.</p> <p>&quot;Everybody&#39;s bargaining them out of business,&quot; said Loren Ginsberg, the executive editor of Corporate Travel magazine. Links to Auto Makers</p> <p>In other industries, like airlines, this kind of competition would produce bankruptcies and a winnowing of competitors. Not so among auto-rental concerns. Most are partly owned by auto manufacturers, which value the rental companies as the last guaranteed market for their cars.</p> <p>Hertz is 49 percent owned by the Ford Motor Company, and Volvo A.B. holds 5 percent. General Motors holds a share of Avis Inc. and of National Car Rental System Inc., the No. 2 and 3 companies by market share. Chrysler owns the Thrifty, Dollar and Snappy car rentals. Mitsubishi Motors owns a controlling interest in Value Rent-a-Car.</p> <p>So exhausted competitors continue to slug it out, and at some airports, arriving passengers are confronted by a dozen or more rental counters.</p> <p>Another tactic the companies have adopted is &quot;yield management,&quot; borrowed from the airlines. They rent cars for different amounts at different times of the week and year. Sometimes they rent identical cars to different customers at different prices, depending on how much in advance the reservation is made.</p> <p>But the financial struggle continues. &quot;People are operating as if the industry is shakeout-proof,&quot; complained Gary Paxton, president of Dollar Rent a Car. &quot;There is little regard for profitability.&quot; Very few companies have been profitable in the last 18 months, he said. Switching for $1 a Day</p> <p>Rental companies that have spent millions of dollars to win market share are loath to give it up, especially since they think the overall market will continue to grow sharply. So they cut rates.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the ability to hold down costs is crucial. Frank Olson, the chairman of Hertz, said, &quot;People will switch companies for a dollar a day.&quot; Hertz said it was becoming uncompetitive nationally because of its losses in New York.</p> <p>Competition among car rental companies has already produced complicated, controversial &quot;collision damage waiver&quot; clauses that are under attack around the country and have split the industry. Some companies now charge as much as $14 a day for the waiver, which is not technically insurance but which makes the car company, rather than the renter, responsible for all damage.</p> <p>Some of those companies acknowledge that they lose money on rentals if the renters turn down the waiver. But Hertz and Avis support elimination of the waiver, as has been done by state law in New York and Illinois, because the charge bears no relationship to the company&#39;s cost. Hertz&#39;s Position</p> <p>Hertz acknowledges that it could compete better without the waiver. The reason, it says, is that other companies lure customers with rates so low that the rental companies lose money, unless they can then sell bloated collision-damage waivers. But customers who go price shopping before they rent compare only rental charges, not insurance, Mr. Olson said, and end up paying more in the end because rental counter salespeople lure them into the insurance. Hertz thinks it could compete better if other companies had to drop their eye-grabbing offers, and instead had to quote a rate that was more representative of what their customers end up paying.</p> <p>Hertz estimates that if the renting company assumes responsibility for collision damage, the cost to the company is $2 a day or less, yet many companies charge as much as $14.</p>
1373826>Energy Dept. Is Challenged Over Waste Disposal Methods As the Energy Department marches ahead with its plan to bury waste from civilian nuclear reactors at Yucca Mountain, it is disposing of waste from its own military reactors in three far shallower sites around the country where it once produced weapons material. But in an odd twist, environmentalists, most of whom oppose the Energy Department&#39;s plan for Yucca, are making use of the law that selected that site by suing to prevent the department from disposing of its wastes in any way other than deep burial.  <p>The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that began fighting the Yucca plan in the 1980&#39;s, and the Snake River Alliance, of Idaho, argue that new rules issued by the department violate the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the law that requires a &#39;&#39;deep geologic repository.&#39;&#39; The Yakama tribe of Washington State joined in the brief, filed Friday in Federal District Court in Boise.</p> <p>The issue is what to do with about 100 million gallons of highly radioactive wastes stored in about 200 old underground tanks at the Hanford nuclear reservation, in eastern Washington; the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, near Idaho Falls; and the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C.</p> <p>The department plans to solidify the wastes, mixing them into molten glass so they cannot spill. Eventually the glass logs are to be buried beside the civilian wastes at Yucca Mountain, about 90 miles from Las Vegas.</p> <p>But under rules issued by the department in July 1999, a significant amount of waste, the material at the bottom of the tanks that is particularly hard to remove, would be left there and &#39;&#39;grouted,&#39;&#39; or mixed with cement.</p> <p>By law, high-level waste, which is supposed to be buried, is defined as the leftovers of reprocessing -- the method by which the Energy Department, and the Atomic Energy Commission before it, produced plutonium for bombs. But the 1999 policy defines the hard-to-get material at the bottom of the tanks as &#39;&#39;incidental,&#39;&#39; a change that means it does not have to be buried deep underground.</p> <p>According to the environmental groups&#39; brief, the Energy Department &#39;&#39;intends to leave literally thousands of gallons of the highly radioactive sediments and sludges at the bottom of the underground tanks, cover the waste in place with concrete, and hope for the best.&#39;&#39; Some of that waste is more radioactive than the wastes that will be pumped out, solidified and buried at Yucca, the groups said.</p> <p>A lawyer at the natural resources council, Geoffrey H. Fettus, said, &#39;&#39;They&#39;re waving a magic wand to re-classify this waste.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The environmentalists contend that the wastes, some of which will be radioactive for tens of thousands of years, will eventually be carried out of the tanks by rainwater or by water that flows through the ground. The tanks in South Carolina are below the water table, meaning that the soil around them is saturated with water.</p> <p>But the importance of the incidental-waste rules pales before the Bush administration&#39;s new waste proposal, contained in the 2003 budget plan for the department. That plan, designed to cut costs and speed cleanup, would cut the amount of waste to be put in glass by about three quarters.</p> <p>Jesse Roberson, assistant secretary for environmental management, said when the budget was unveiled on Feb. 4 that &#39;&#39;we believe that there are more effective ways to demonstrate results.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The environmentalists&#39; suit predates the budget plan, but if the suit is successful, it would appear to doom the new strategy.</p> <p>A spokesman for the department, Joseph H. Davis, said he could not discuss the case in detail because it was before the courts. But, Mr. Davis said, it was &#39;&#39;rather odd that they would pursue a lawsuit that would slow down cleanup.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The budget proposal, he said, was still only a proposal.</p> <p>Mr. Fettus said if the wastes were not buried, they would create &#39;&#39;national sacrifice zones&#39;&#39; that require care in perpetuity. In fact, the Energy Department has used a similar argument against critics of Yucca, saying that the only safe way to dispose of radioactive waste permanently is to put it deep underground, as the 1982 law requires.</p> <p>The cost to clean up the nuclear weapons complex has been put at $200 billion or more over several decades, but the technology for some parts of the work has yet to be developed, so the estimates are highly uncertain. Opening Yucca is likewise uncertain, but Mr. Fettus said opposing shallow burial and opposing Yucca were not contradictory.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The Natural Resources Defense Council has never taken the position that a geologic repository is not one of the answers,&#39;&#39; he said. Besides, he said, wastes encased in glass and awaiting deep burial are in a more stable form than wastes covered with grout.</p>
1512594>Use of Old Maps Is Faulted In Pennsylvania Mine Drama The accident that flooded the Quecreek Mine in Pennsylvania last summer, trapping nine miners whose televised rescue riveted the nation, could have been avoided if the mining companies had realized they were using outdated maps, federal safety investigators said today. Two mining companies and a surveying company were negligent for relying on an inaccurate map of an adjacent, flooded mine that had been abandoned 30 years earlier, according to the report issued today by the investigators from the Department of Labor.  <p>The map the companies used was undated and had not been certified by an engineer. An investigation after the accident showed that it had been completed about 1957 but that another 421,000 tons of coal had been mined by the time the mine closed in 1964. The mine had opened in 1913.</p> <p>The investigators said the root cause of the accident was that no final map of the abandoned mine was readily available. Months after the accident, a final map was found in a museum, investigators said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Quecreek has unveiled a number of things,&#39;&#39; said David D. Lauriski, the assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. &#39;&#39;One is that if you have any suspicion at all, there are other ways to get information.&#39;&#39; As an example, he said, production and royalty figures can be measured against maps to see if they agree.</p> <p>On July 24, 2002, a machine operator in the Quecreek Mine broke through to an adjacent mine, filled with water, that the map said was 450 feet away. Nine miners were trapped for up to 78 hours, and rescuers sank a 30-inch diameter shaft through a nearby pasture to reach them, raising them 240 feet in a capsule. Tourists still visit the site, about 60 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.</p> <p>Since the rescue, Congress has appropriated $10 million to inventory old maps and move them to computers and to develop technologies for finding mines for which there are no maps. The government has also established a toll-free hot line, at (888) 753-9427, which people with old mine maps can call to send them in for copying. It is difficult to determine whether many of those maps are correct, Mr. Lauriski said, because mines tend to grow over the years, and not all the &#39;&#39;rooms&#39;&#39; created by mining are mapped.</p> <p>Until the Quecreek accident, the government received about a dozen reports annually of contact with abandoned mines that were flooded or contained oxygen-depleted air, he said. Such reports are down since then, Mr. Lauriski said, probably because miners are being more careful.</p> <p>In a statement, a lawyer for PBS Coals, one of the companies cited for negligence, emphasized that no intentional wrongdoing had been found and that wet conditions just before the breakthrough were not a clue to what was about to happen. The company and its consultants &#39;&#39;vigorously dispute any allegation of negligence,&#39;&#39; said the lawyer, Vincent J. Barbera. &#39;&#39;They relied on the best information that was available at that time,&#39;&#39; Mr. Barbera said.</p> <p>Randy Musser, the president of Musser Engineering, which prepared a permit application showing that the old mine was 450 feet away, said in a telephone interview that the Mine Safety and Health Administration &#39;&#39;made statements to us, they believed we had done the work in accordance with the practices and standards in existence at the time the work was prepared.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They came across as though they had to issue a citation just because there was additional mining that had not been shown on that map, even though they&#39;re not sure how we would have determined that at the time,&#39;&#39; Mr. Musser said. He said that procedures had been changed since the accident.</p> <p>A message left for an executive of Black Wolf Coal Company, which operates the mine, was not returned.</p> <p>The report gives a harrowing picture of the trapped miners&#39; time underground.</p> <p>When they accidentally broke through, about 8:45 p.m. on Wednesday, July 24, water rushed in so fast that they had trouble keeping their footing, sometimes swimming within the mine. They traveled thousands of feet looking for an escape but retreated because the exits were in areas that had filled with water. At one point they huddled around a mining machine to keep warm. They used concrete blocks to try to barricade themselves against the water.</p> <p>Shortly after 5 a.m. on Thursday, July 25, a 6.5-inch drill bit reached them. They hit the bit three times to indicate they were alive, and nine more times to show that there were nine of them.</p> <p>But the rising water forced them to retreat from the bit about six and a half hours later, and they stopped tapping. Later they tried tapping on a roof bolt, but seismic equipment on the surface failed to detect it because of the noise from the drilling.</p> <p>At one point, the miners &#39;&#39;estimated they had about an hour left based on the rate the water was rising,&#39;&#39; the report said. &#39;&#39;The miners took some time to reflect on their situation and prepared for the worst. Some of the miners tied themselves together so they could be found together in the event they were drowned. They wrote notes to their families and placed them in a plastic bucket. The bucket was closed with a lid, sealed with electrical tape and secured near the roof bolting machine to prevent it from floating away,&#39;&#39; according to the report.</p> <p>The water eventually receded because of frantic pumping by the rescuers. But by Friday, July 26, drilling stopped for about 18 hours because of a broken bit.</p> <p>The men were rescued from 12:55 a.m. to 2:45 a.m. on Sunday, July 28.</p> <p>The Mine Safety and Health Administration, part of the Labor Department, found that before the accident the mine had been cited for violations about one-third as often as the national average for underground coal mines, and had a rate of lost work time due to nonfatal injuries that was a little more than half the national average.</p>
1787617>Flight Controller Had Little Sleep Before Crash The air traffic controller in the tower on Sunday when a Comair jet took off from the wrong runway had had just two hours of sleep, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday evening. The controller has told investigators that he saw the jet on the taxiway and gave it clearance to take off, and then turned his back to attend to other duties, failing to see it take the wrong turn. The plane crashed 29 seconds later, killing 49 of the 50 people on board.  <p>The safety board member, Deborah Hersman, said Wednesday that in addition to his ground duties, the controller had radar responsibilities, including telling the crew of an American Eagle plane that was 3 minutes and 12 seconds ahead of the Comair jet to change course to avoid bad weather. Ms. Hersman said the controller told investigators that after giving the takeoff clearance to the Comair jet, he began to take a count of traffic during his shift.</p> <p>The Comair plane crashed about 6 a.m. Sunday. The controller had come on duty at 11:30 p.m. Saturday, Ms. Hersman said, and had finished his previous shift, seven hours of work, at 2:30 p.m. Saturday.</p> <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has a longstanding policy that controllers should not be required to perform both radar work, like ordering changes in path for planes in flight, and ground duties, and it repeated that in a memorandum to managers in November. But since the accident, it has become clear that the policy has not been enforced at small towers around the country.</p> <p>Ms. Hersman said: &#39;&#39;We will not just be looking at this shift. We will be taking a systems approach to this.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;re looking at people who determine policy and make decisions about staffing,&#39;&#39; she added.</p> <p>The safety board continued on Wednesday to document the circumstances of the crash, but its conclusions usually take a year or more, and it generally will not release the cockpit voice recorder transcript or detailed information from the flight data recorder for months. If the board finds an urgent problem, it often issues recommendations before releasing its conclusions.</p> <p>Others pressed for quick changes though. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, called for more air traffic controllers around the country, especially in New York.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Sadly, the F.A.A. continues to short-staff control towers in an effort to control costs while they eschew safety,&#39;&#39; Mr. Schumer said. &#39;&#39;We have seen too many close calls, and now this week a tragic accident.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Schumer sought to link an episode in New York last year, in which three planes came too close together, to short staffing at the radar office in the area.</p> <p>Representatives James L. Oberstar of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Jerry F. Costello of Illinois, the ranking Democrat on its aviation subcommittee, asked the acting inspector general of the Transportation Department, of which the F.A.A. is a part, to investigate. They asked how many airports, like Blue Grass Airport here, had one controller handle both ground observation and radar</p> <p>The aviation agency has at different times explained its opposition to such doubling up as a &#39;&#39;policy&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;guidance,&#39;&#39; and said it was a longstanding interpretation of its rules.</p> <p>After its memorandum last November, the manager at Blue Grass Airport responded by trying to shift radar duties to an office in Indianapolis. But a spokeswoman for the aviation agency, Laura J. Brown, said that had been delayed because the Indianapolis center was in the middle of changes to improve traffic flow.</p> <p>The F.A.A. used to have agreed-upon staffing levels with the controllers, but now says its policy is to &#39;&#39;staff to traffic,&#39;&#39; to have the appropriate number of controllers on duty, to minimize taxpayer expense while keeping the system safe. Despite the agency&#39;s policy, Ms. Brown said, the manager in Lexington apparently thought he had the flexibility to have a single controller on duty because there were usually only six to eight flights from midnight to 6 a.m.</p> <p>This dispute over staffing comes after a recent defeat for the controllers&#39; union. The F.A.A. declared an impasse in contract negotiations this year and imposed a new contract. The agency is seeking to lower staffing levels, and especially to lower overtime, saying it cannot afford previous levels of staffing, because of changes in airline economics.</p>
738517>Fears Raised On Possibility Of Fare Rise The uncertainty of government subsidies for mass transit in New York could force a fare increase in the near future and is jeopardizing a plan to offer discounts to riders, transit officials said yesterday. But they added that it was too soon to predict the timing and size of a fare increase. &quot;Until the state&#39;s executive budget comes out on Feb. 1, we won&#39;t have a clear idea of exactly how much trouble we&#39;re in,&quot; said Jay Walder, executive director and chief financial officer of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.  <p>The M.T.A., with an operating budget of more than $3 billion a year, is already short by about $200 million, money that the city is apparently withholding until several issues involving the authority are resolved.</p> <p>In one dispute, the city has threatened to stop payments at the end of this month for the transit police force to pressure the authority into agreeing to merge the force with the city&#39;s Police Department. But the city is already $88 million behind in its payments for the transit police, said John Cunningham, a spokesman for the M.T.A.</p> <p>In another dispute, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has withheld payments to the M.T.A. for schoolchildren&#39;s bus and subway fares, insisting that the state should cover the cost.</p> <p>In addition, the possible loss of state and Federal subsidies could create further holes in the budget. George E. Pataki, even before being sworn in as Governor, asked the authority to delay spending about $300 million, and his administration is reviewing a major state tax whose revenues -- about $330 million a year -- go to the M.T.A. The tax expires later this year.</p> <p>The Republican-led Congress is also expected to review mass-transit assistance for the fiscal year that begins next October. One proposal cuts all such subsidies; another concentrates cuts on large cities.</p> <p>This year, the M.T.A. is expecting to receive $1 billion from Albany, $80 million from the Federal Government ($20 million of which is targeted for commuter rail lines) and $605 million from the city. Mr. Giuliani expressed little sympathy yesterday for the authority&#39;s financial problems and urged it to reduce management costs. &quot;It seems to me,&quot; he said, &quot;that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, with a surplus and a scale of salaries much, much higher than the city&#39;s, or the state&#39;s for that matter, could find a lot of room in administrative reductions so it wouldn&#39;t have to do a fare hike. But I haven&#39;t seen their plans.&quot;</p> <p>Recognizing all the uncertainty it faces, the M.T.A. decided last month to delay adopting a budget for its fiscal year that began on Jan. 1. It has also held off on a new price structure that would take advantange of its fare card system, Metrocard, which cost the authority more than $700 million to create.</p> <p>The proposed discount program included free transfers between buses and subways for two-zone riders, who now pay two fares each way. A 5 percent discount was to be offered on Metrocards of $20 or more, or an unlimited-rides monthly card for the price of 55 fares.</p> <p>To pay for such discounts, the M.T.A. had planned a 10-cent fare increase in July and an additional 15-cent rise in 1997, but the program had not been formally approved.</p> <p>New York Newsday reported yesterday that an M.T.A. official, who declined to be named, had said a 25-cent fare rise was possible by July.</p> <p>Transit officials said such a prediction was premature. The possibility of a 25-cent increase was also denounced yesterday by a subway advocacy group, the Straphangers Campaign, which said it would be the largest in the history of the system. The last increase, a dime, was made on Jan. 1, 1992, bringing the fare to its current $1.25. Before that, the fare was increased 15 cents in 1990.</p> <p>A fare increase could break the favorable momentum of growing ridership and service improvements, said Gene Russianoff, a lawyer with the Straphangers group. In 1992, the M.T.A. had begun what it called the Fare Deal, a strategy to increase revenues by luring more riders through better service and fare discounts.</p> <p>The M.T.A.&#39;s current round of problems began in October, when Mayor Giuliani said he would withhold $113 million that the city was supposed to pay the authority to cover reduced-fare rides for schoolchildren on public transportation. The cost, which Mr. Giuliani would like the state to pick up, comes to $130 million a year. The Mayor said then that the M.T.A. could cover the loss out of a surplus it had accumulated.</p> <p>The city also covers the cost of the transit police, $320 million a year, but Mr. Giuliani wants that police force merged with the city police, a step that the M.T.A. is resisting. The authority is seeking arbitration of the dispute with the city.</p> <p>Up for grabs is a state surcharge on corporate tax returns that is expected to net the M.T.A. $330 million this year and is up for renewal in December. The authority is also supposed to receive revenue from a new tax on oil companies, but this, too, is under re-examination. In December, the incoming Pataki team asked the M.T.A. to delay a $300 million bond issue that would have been repaid with the petroleum tax receipts.</p> <p>&quot;They haven&#39;t announced what their intention is exactly,&quot; Mr. Cunningham said. &quot;They just asked us to hold off. That raises a concern on our part that the money may not be available.&quot;</p> <p>Adding to all the questions at the M.T.A. is that Peter E. Stangl, the authority&#39;s chairman, is an appointee of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and it is unclear how much longer he will hold the post. Mr. Stangl was not available for comment yesterday.</p>
1598894>Republicans Help Push Nader Close to Spot on Michigan Ballot With the apparent assistance of the state Republican Party, Ralph Nader appears likely to secure a spot on the Michigan presidential ballot. But Democrats are calling for him to withdraw and are threatening to file a complaint against the Republicans, charging that they contributed illegally to the Nader campaign. Mr. Nader had gathered 5,400 signatures on petitions in Michigan but stopped collecting them over a month ago, deciding instead to go after the nomination of the Reform Party. After he stopped the petition effort, though, a split within the Reform Party made it uncertain that he would get the nomination.  <p>But last Thursday, the deadline for submitting signatures, more than 50,000 signatures were submitted on behalf of Mr. Nader. The state requires 30,000 signatures.</p> <p>It appears that it was the Republican Party that stepped in to help Mr. Nader. It is widely believed that if Mr. Nader is on the ballot in Michigan and other states, he would draw more votes from John Kerry, the likely Democratic nominee, than from President Bush.</p> <p>An article from The Detroit News posted on the state Republican Party&#39;s Web site quotes the party&#39;s executive director as saying, &#39;&#39;We are absolutely interested in having Ralph Nader on the ballot,&#39;&#39; and adds that the executive director, Greg McNeilly, was personally circulating petitions for Mr. Nader.</p> <p>Mr. McNeilly told fellow Republicans in a recent e-mail message that the Democrats were trying to keep Mr. Nader off the ballot, and that &#39;&#39;your help is needed in the next five days to ensure that Michigan voters are not disenfranchised.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mark Brewer, the executive chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, has asserted that the Republicans&#39; petition-gathering was a contribution and that &#39;&#39;there is no way they could have gathered over 40,000 signatures and spent less than $5,000,&#39;&#39; which is the legal limit.</p> <p>Kevin Zeese, a spokesman for Mr. Nader, said that the Republican work on behalf of Mr. Nader was not coordinated with Mr. Nader&#39;s campaign and thus was not subject to campaign contribution limits.</p> <p>CAMPAIGN 2004: THE INDEPENDENT</p>
370197>New Reactor Designs Are Criticized in Report Manufacturers designing a new generation of nuclear reactors overstate the safety benefits of new features, and their changes would leave the plants more vulnerable than current designs to certain kinds of accidents, according to a 200-page study released yesterday by a nuclear watchdog group.  <p>The study is the broadest critique yet of the effort to reinvent the nuclear reactor with new designs that would be cheaper to build and easier to operate. All orders for reactors since 1974 have been canceled.</p> <p>The nuclear industry has described the new designs as &#39;&#39;inherently safe&#39;&#39; or as demonstrating &#39;&#39;passive&#39;&#39; safety features, which do not involve failure-prone mechanical systems or human actions.</p> <p>But &#39;&#39;there is nothing inherently safe about a nuclear reactor,&#39;&#39; said the study, commissioned by the Union of Concerned Scientists and performed by a consulting firm set up by three nuclear engineers formerly with the General Electric Company. The firm is MHB Technical Associates of San Jose, Calif.</p> <p>Gregory C. Minor, a former manager in the advanced-control and instrumentation department at G.E. who supervised the study, said in an interview, &#39;&#39;A reactor is not an inherently safe device in the hands of normal people doing normal things and trying to operate it as a power source.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Waste Disposal Problem</p> <p>Robert Pollard, an engineer formerly with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and now the chief safety expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: &#39;&#39;There&#39;s no question in my mind it&#39;s possible to design reactors that are safer; it&#39;s also possible to design a reactor that is economically competitive. I&#39;m not yet convinced you can do both.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In addition, Mr. Pollard&#39;s group opposes construction of new reactors until a method is demonstrated for disposing of radioactive waste.</p> <p>The report welcomed several steps toward reactors that are &#39;&#39;passively safe,&#39;&#39; but said such a claim was overused. For example, a Westinghouse Electric Corporation design would deliver emergency cooling water to the reactor without the use of pumps; instead, the water would be forced in by the pressure of gas stored in the tanks. But the system is not passive, the study said, because sensors must determine that the water is needed, and send a signal to mechanical valves.</p> <p>Mimi Limbach, a Westinghouse spokesman, said of the criticism of the design her company has billed as &#39;&#39;advanced passive&#39;&#39;: &#39;&#39;They&#39;re quite correct, it does require sensors to identify the condition.&#39;&#39; But while the plant&#39;s safety systems are not &#39;&#39;perfectly passive,&#39;&#39; she said, &#39;&#39;the overriding design is passive, based on natural physical forces,&#39;&#39; including gravity and heat convection.</p> <p>The study surveyed the main features of three new designs - those of Westinghouse, General Atomics, a small company in San Diego, and General Electric. It applauded many design concepts, but said all three models would represent a relaxation of some current safety standards, including some elements of a design philosophy called &#39;&#39;defense in depth,&#39;&#39; in which components that might fail are backed up by other design features.</p> <p>For example, existing reactors are surrounded by very strong steel and concrete buildings called containments, as a last barrier in case numerous failures cause a radiation leak. But two of the three designs studied eschew that feature. All three would do without emergency plans for the area surrounding the plants -such plans are required for existing plants.</p> <p>Two would rely so heavily on built-in features for safety that the control rooms and the human operators would not be considered as having a safety-related function. Thus they would be subject to far less regulatory scrutiny. That strategy &#39;&#39;is a radical and unjustified departure from the requirements of existing Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations,&#39;&#39; the study said.</p> <p>But at General Atomics, Linden S. Blue, the vice chairman, said the words &#39;&#39;inherently safe&#39;&#39; were justified.</p> <p>The General Atomics design is for fuel encapsulated in graphite instead of metal, and cooled by helium instead of water. The metal used in existing reactors can melt, but the fuel cannot get hot enough to damage the graphite, according to General Atomics, and water can boil away, but helium cannot.</p> <p>BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
311971>Scientists Urge Delay of New Nuclear Arms Plants The National Academy of Sciences advised the Department of Energy yesterday to postpone and possibly cancel $1 billion in new plants to process plutonium for bombs, including one that is a key part of its modernization plan.  <p>In a report requested by Congress, the Academy said &#39;&#39;virtually every facility&#39;&#39; in the bomb complex is contaminated with radioactive and poisonous materials. The Academy also said that in taking on the immense job of cleaning up the 17 major plants in 12 states, the department should establish a consistent policy based on the risk to human health.</p> <p>Some cleanup jobs would increase risk rather than decrease it, the report said, and in some cases dangerous materials should be left in place, under surveillance, until techniques are developed for removing them.</p> <p>The 97-page report, assembled by the Academy&#39;s National Research Council, makes many of the same points that have been made by outside critics about extensive pollution, broken-down plants, management problems and threats to worker health and safety. Two Surprises in Study</p> <p>Experts outside the department said they found two surprises in the study. The scientists found that 11 kilograms of plutonium had escaped into ventilation ducts at the Hanford nuclear reservation in southeastern Washington, a problem not previously disclosed, and the department had a stockpile of seven to eight metric tons of sub-bomb-grade plutonium. That number had been classified.</p> <p>The department said in a statement that the report endorsed many initiatives undertaken by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins.</p> <p>But the study runs directly counter to the department&#39;s plans to increase the capacity to make plutonium.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The current supply of plutonium and the current capacity to process both virgin and recycled plutonium from retired weapons or scrap are adequate to meet the demand for maintaining a stockpile similar to the current one,&#39;&#39; said the panel of 18 scientists.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Because plutonium is long-lived and toxic and must be carefully safeguarded for reasons of national security,&#39;&#39; the panel continued, &#39;&#39;the production of additional, virgin plutonium implies additional costs to society for maintaining safeguards and protecting public health and the environment.&#39;&#39; Plutonium Purification Plan</p> <p>An important segment of the Department of Energy&#39;s modernization plan is a plant at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, near Idaho Falls, that would use lasers to purify the sub-bomb-grade plutonium. The department has estimated the cost at $600 million, although critics say it would be far higher. They contend that the department has a poor track record in estimating the cost of novel equipment.</p> <p>The department would also like to renovate, for $400 million, a building at its Rocky Flats plant, near Denver, for recovering plutonium scrap. The building, which cost $225 million, was used for one month before it was closed because of engineering problems.</p> <p>Whether the nation needs additional bomb fuel is also an issue because of the announcement last week that the Hanford reservation&#39;s Purex plant, which separates plutonium from the other components of irradiated uranium, will remain shut for at least another year, after a brief run to clean out the pipes of material left there when it was abruptly closed last December for safety reasons.</p> <p>Some analysts say that running Purex again would require hundreds of millions of dollars in improvements, and note that only a few years of irradiated uranium are on hand to be processed, because the reactor that supplied Purex, the N-Reactor, has been permanently closed, also for safety reasons.</p>
633422>Experts Say Fear of Asbestos Exceeds the Risk in Schools The decision to delay the opening of New York City&#39;s schools while they are inspected for asbestos was based more on a need to reassure fearful parents than on any estimate of health risk in this situation, health experts and school officials say. There is no question that asbestos inhaled over a long period in significant quantities can cause cancer or lung disease. But the health risks posed by a few days, or even months, of attendance in schools with asbestos where the exposure could be limited are negligible, they said -- less than the statistical likelihood of developing AIDS or being killed by a mugger, a drunken driver or a bolt of lightning. Indeed, the dangers to children while playing in the streets while out of school are probably greater than the risks of spending a few days in a school while officials establish whether asbestos is present.  <p>&quot;We&#39;re not talking about a very large health risk because of a week or two, or even a couple of months, in the school,&quot; said Dr. James Melius, director of the State Division of Occupational Health and Environmental Epidemiology. But talk of statistics and epidemiology are of little comfort to anxious parents, who hear uncertainty and vagueness. &quot;Parents can say, &#39;If you can&#39;t tell me what the situation is, how can you tell me it&#39;s safe?&#39; &quot;</p> <p>That view is shared not only by other scientists, but also by those who made the decision to close the schools. Until New York City school officials complete their inspections of more than 1,000 school buildings, researchers and health experts will not be able to assure people that the schools are safe.</p> <p>&quot;Some say the reaction is overblown,&quot; said Meyer S. Frucher, a trustee of the School Construction Authority. &quot;But we had no choice but to respond as we did, given both the Federal law and the concerns of both parents and employees. There did not seem to be any other way to allay the concern but to test every single exposed surface. Notwithstanding all of the evidence, people still have an extraordinary fear.&quot;</p> <p>Much of the fear of asbestos stems from the deaths of thousands of men exposed to vast amounts used in insulation for shipbuilding in World War II. In large doses, asbestos can cause asbestosis, a noncancerous but often fatal scarring of the lungs. It can also cause mesothelioma, a rare cancer of the lining of the lungs or abdominal cavity, as well as lung cancer, especially among cigarette smokers.</p> <p>No one can say for sure what levels of asbestos exposure cause health problems. Unlike other environmental hazards, -- lead, for instance -- there is no way to tell how much a person has ingested.</p> <p>&quot;There is no test for the exposure that children had yesterday that will tell their parents if and how much they have in their bodies,&quot; said Heather R. Maurer, executive director of the Asbestos Victims of America, a nonprofit group based in San Jose, Calif. &quot;There is nothing that we know of that can take away asbestos that is inside the bodies of people exposed to it.&quot; Pediatricians Take Note</p> <p>Ms. Maurer&#39;s group, which has 19,000 members, recommends that pediatricians note if a child might have been exposed to asbestos, so that if a lung problem develops later, a physician would have an easier time making a diagnosis.</p> <p>The asbestos crisis has drawn far more emotion lately than other far greater risks because of the failure of school authorities to test the buildings adequately. As a practical matter, experts say, society thinks differently about people who voluntarily assume risks, through cigarette smoking, for example, than about children compelled to sit in school five or six hours a day, 180 days a year.</p> <p>&quot;These children and teachers are not buying into this risk freely,&quot; said Dr. Alice Stark, director of the State Health Department&#39;s Bureau of Environmental and Occupational Epidemiology. A Cause of Cancer</p> <p>Asbestos has been suspected as a health threat for most of this century and conclusively recognized as a cause of a rare form of cancer 30 years ago. But the development of lung disease depends on the length and severity of exposure. &quot;A chunk of asbestos falling from the ceiling is different from sprayed insulation steadily giving off airborne particles,&quot; Dr. Melius said. &quot;And exposed insulation around a pipe in a basement is very different from ceiling tiles releasing fibers.&quot;</p> <p>Children do not appear to be any more likely than adults to develop asbestos-related disease, experts say. But asbestos-related cancer generally does not appear for at least 10 years and sometimes much longer after a person has been exposed. If older adults are exposed, some would be expected to die of other causes before they had a chance to develop mesothelioma or lung cancer. Children, on the other hand, have most of a lifetime to do so.</p> <p>The very uncertainty about the danger of asbestos seems to increase the fears about it. Two years ago the Health Effects Institute-Asbestos Research, an independent, nonprofit organization in Cambridge, Mass., surveyed the literature on typical asbestos levels in air in public buildings and on how much asbestos it takes to make a person sick. The institute, which received money from the Federal Government and private groups, made an estimate of the fatal cancer rate for a million children, exposed 180 days a year, five hours a day from age 5 to age 18.</p> <p>If all New York&#39;s public-school children were exposed to an average level in a school, the institute said, about 6 would die prematurely; if they were exposed to a high level, about 60 would die. But what the Health Effects Institute called high was half the standard now in use in the city school cleanup; average was one-tenth the level used by the city.</p> <p>Moreover, some scientists question the accuracy of estimating cancer deaths from certain types of exposure. Dr. Stark, for example, said such estimates are partly based on animal data. And, she said, the effects for small doses are usually calculated by taking known effects for high doses and extrapolating downward.</p> <p>The dangers of asbestos were first demonstrated scientifically in a 1960 study of asbestos miners and people who lived near a mine in South Africa. In the years that followed, the Mount Sinai Medical Center&#39;s Environmental and Occupational Health Division, led by Dr. Irving J. Selikoff, established that industrial workers who handled asbestos suffered high rates of asbestosis.</p> <p>As a result, the Federal Government began taking steps to limit its use in buildings and to curb worker exposure. In 1986 Congress passed the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act, which requires inspections of asbestos in schools and removal or containment in certain circumstances. That is the law under which New York City is now inspecting the schools.</p> <p>But as the law began to require that steps be taken, the body of scientific opinion modified its estimate of the hazards. Three years after the school inspection law, The New England Journal of Medicine published a review of asbestos research that suggested that chrysotile, the kind of asbestos most commonly used in city schools as a fire retardant, was not so dangerous. But there is no scientific consensus on this point in this country. Most other countries regulate asbestos type by type, but the United States treats it all the same.</p> <p>Still, others are convinced that asbestos is making people sick. Ms. Maurer of the Asbestos Victims of America said that every week, four or five more cases appear. &quot;I&#39;m getting 40- and 50-year-old people calling me with mesothelioma, having no idea where they got it,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s not an occupational exposure; it&#39;s got to be from buildings or schools.&quot;</p> <p>At the Health Effects Institute, Dr. Rashid Shaikh, the associate executive director, said: &quot;It&#39;s absolutely true that there are a number of cases in the United States, about a quarter of the cases, where people come down with mesothelioma with no history of occupational exposure. It&#39;s the buildings, the environment or just a background rate of mesothelioma in the population. It&#39;s difficult to sort out.&quot;</p> <p>Asbestos is no longer used, but was once so widely used as an insulator and fireproofing agent, as an ingredient of floor tiles, ceiling tiles, plaster and pipe wrapping, that it is certain to be around for decades.</p> <p>Current practice is to leave asbestos in place if undamaged, but schools are renovating and repairing in ways likely to uncover asbestos. Experts say that more than $6 billion has been spent to remove or seal asbestos in the nation&#39;s 110,000 schools.</p> <p>But in attempting to determine the health threat posed by asbestos, scientists and school officials must deal with the fact that the simple presence of asbestos does not mean there is a risk. To cause harm, the asbestos must be floating in the air.  Fear of Loss of Evidence</p> <p>Some experts worry that in trying to seal and repair damaged asbestos in the school, officials are removing any clues that would help determine the extent of the risk to schoolchildren. Edward J. Swoszowski Jr., a Manhattan environmental consultant who represents some parents, complained to the School Construction Authority that it was &quot;destroying evidence&quot; by fixing crumbling asbestos before it could be inventoried.</p> <p>He described officials&#39; stance as &quot;we&#39;re going to find the problem and we&#39;re going to fix it and nobody&#39;s ever going to know how bad it was.&quot;</p> <p>School officials are, in fact, gathering some data on the amount of asbestos fibers in the air in the schools, information that could give a clue to the extent of the health threat. They have not made that data public.</p> <p>Bernard P. Orlan, the School Construction Authority&#39;s director of Industrial and Environmental Hygiene, said that under Federal rules, repair workers took air measurements before, during and after their work. He said that measurements taken before work began showed asbestos levels below the standard set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 0.01 fibers per cubic centimeter. When the work is done, the concentration must be below that level for the job to pass muster.</p> <p>Mr. Orlan said he was pleased that the measurements were low even before the repair work began. &quot;As a hygienist and as a parent with kids in the system, it&#39;s some of the best news we&#39;ve had in a long time,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, Richard Stapleton, said the readings were not intended to measure the level of risk to occupants before the work started.  If loose asbestos was present, he said, and if a room was filled with children stirring up the air, or if a breeze was blowing, then the readings might be higher, Mr. Stapleton said.</p> <p>As concern about asbestos has grown, so has the number of lawsuits. Of the more than 200,000 people who have filed personal injury claims against asbestos manufacturers, all had occupational exposures, rather than the kinds of exposures experienced by schoolchildren, teachers or office workers, said Lawrence Fitzpatrick, the president of the Center for Claims Resolution, a company in Princeton, N.J., established by manufacturers to handle claims.</p> <p>Ms. Maurer said that children who had attended schools with exposed asbestos should be watched for patterns of mesothelioma.</p> <p>Even so, some people question whether the exposure levels typical of schools make much difference.</p> <p>&quot;On the list of things to worry about, it&#39;s low,&quot; said Laurie A. Westley, the chief lobbyist of the National School Board Association of Alexandria, Va. &quot;We think there are enormous judgments that have to be made about the relative risks of a large range of things,&quot; she said, mentioning lead paint and radon.</p> <p>Dr. Stark of the New York State Health Department, who specializes in environmental health, wondered whether asbestos control was the wisest place to put limited money. &quot;If it were up to me to choose how to spend that money, I would spend it for teachers, I would spend it for books, for materials for children.&quot; ASBESTOS IN THE SCHOOLS: Where to Call</p> <p>With the public school year delayed until at least Sept. 20, several information numbers are available to help New York City schoolchildren and their parents figure out how to spend the extra days off.</p> <p>The Department of Parks and Recreation, at (800) 834-3832, can provide information about the city&#39;s 11 Olympic-size swimming pools, which will remain open after Labor Day, and 32 recreation centers that will be extending their hours.</p> <p>New York City Youthline, at (800) 246-4646, offers information about meals programs, day care and recreation activities. The hotline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p> <p>The Board of Education will continue operating its asbestos phone line, at (718) 472-1705.</p>
673799>The Nation; How Does the World Look Through the Eyes Of Aspiring Terrorists? IN preparation for the first anniversary of the World Trade Center bombing late last month, the New York Police Department sent bomb-sniffing dogs to survey landmarks like the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty and other likely targets of terrorism. The dogs hunted inside but made a special survey of the perimeters, partly as a show, said John F. Timoney, the chief of police. &quot;It was to let them know, whoever &#39;they&#39; are, that we haven&#39;t forgotten,&quot; he said. Although the World Trade Center explosion has not been followed by similar acts of terror -- the police broke up a cell that was planning additional bombings around the 4th of July, at the Hudson River tunnels, the Federal Building in lower Manhattan, and other targets -- Chief Timoney said that he suspected the terrorists might still &quot;be looking to make their mark.&quot;  <p>On Friday, a Federal jury delivered verdicts of guilty against four men accused in the World Trade Center case. But larger issues -- like how a society can protect itself from terrorists -- remain unresolved.</p> <p>As the United States, the only surviving superpower, tries to create peace in the Middle East and Bosnia, some experts think the potential for terrorism is rising. When a gunman opened fire last week on a van of Hasidic students driving across the Brooklyn Bridge, the first word in many people&#39;s minds was &quot;terrorism,&quot; though so far there is no evidence of a plot.</p> <p>The World Trade Center explosion, frequently described as the worst act of terrorism on American soil, was a warning that the United States is more vulnerable than many experts had assumed. But what should officials be doing?</p> <p>A year after the bombing, surprisingly few security changes are evident. But there has been some rethinking, an attempt to get into the minds of terrorists and try to anticipate what constitutes an attractive target, and what does not.</p> <p>The blast has shattered several assumptions, some stated and some nearly subliminal. There was a sense among law-enforcement and security experts that it would be impossible to assemble and deliver a bomb weighing three-quarters of a ton without doing something that would attract suspicion; that is gone now.</p> <p>There was also the idea that bombing big buildings like the World Trade Center would not move public opinion in a way that would help the bomber&#39;s cause. But the public in this country may not be the audience. In the World Trade Center case, New York may have found itself in the unaccustomed position of being the stage for someone else&#39;s drama. Thomas G. Weiss, associate director of the Thomas J. Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University, said the explosion was aimed as much at Egyptian dissidents as at the American public.</p> <p>Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at the Rand Corp., said the message read like this: &quot;Four &#39;amateurs&#39; with readily available, commercially produced materials, can build a bomb for under $400 that kills six people, causes untold millions of dollars in losses and generates endless publicity.&quot; Hitting a high-profile target shows, he said, &quot;that to a large extent, anybody can be a terrorist.&quot;</p> <p>The Trade Center bomb was the equivalent of a black eye or a bloody nose, meant for all to see, not a blow to the solar plexus, meant to knock an opponent down. For the country as a whole, the solar plexus would include electricity dispatch centers, oil pipelines or nuclear plants -- targets not designed to withstand serious attack.</p> <p>At one electric utility control center, the official in charge said that since the bombing, he had added cameras and motion detectors, but mostly to protect against burglaries. &quot;At any industrial plant, somebody can bring a delivery truck up to your loading dock and you don&#39;t know what&#39;s in it,&quot; he said. A bombing is a &quot;low-probability, high-impact event, certainly, but very difficult to do anything with,&quot; he said. &quot;The idea is not to call attention to yourself.&quot;</p> <p>What might be called the &quot;obscurity defense&quot; is in full swing at the Colonial Pipeline, which runs from Houston to the New York area and supplies about half the refined oil products used in the Northeast. With branches, it totals 5,300 miles, making it essentially unguardable, although it can be surveyed by air and by electronic means. The World Trade Center case was &quot;not really perceived by us as a threat to the system,&quot; said Noel L. Griese, a spokesman.</p> <p>But terrorism need not involve bombs or even violence. An opponent bent on widespread disruption, rather than symbolism, might try computer sabotage. Recalling a computer glitch at a New York bank last month that debited depositors&#39; accounts twice for each withdrawal they made, Mr. Weiss suggested, a terrorist could find a smart computer programmer and &quot;wreak havoc.&quot; As recent history shows, the system is not safe from domestic hackers, let alone trained agents of a foreign power.</p> <p>Nuclear plants have relied on a kind of obscurity defense, too. But the Trade Center case may force some rethinking. Police believe one man convicted in the bombing wrote a letter sent to The New York Times last year threatening a variety of structures, including &quot;nuclear targets.&quot; In an unrelated incident, a former mental patient drove his station wagon through the gate at Three Mile Island a few days before the Trade Center attack, crashed through a fence and a roll-up door, and drove 60 feet into the building that leads to the control room.</p> <p>Now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is not sure what rules to impose. Going against the common wisdom, the Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington-based non-proliferation group, argues that terrorists are likely to pick &quot;soft targets,&quot; that is, lightly defended ones, a category that includes reactors.</p> <p>One positive lesson learned in the year after the bombing is that the best strategy is a forward defense. The July 4th bombings were pre-empted by lawmen who burst into a bomb factory. Last April four Palestinians were indicted in Washington for plotting to blow up the Israeli embassy.</p> <p>Chief Timoney meets with corporate security chiefs about once every three weeks. He has no trouble holding their attention, but vigilance in society at large is tougher. Everyone was worried in the period leading up to the American attack on Iraq in 1991, he said, but once the attack began, people seemed to lose interest.</p> <p>&quot;We do continuously have liaison with all the different Federal, state and local authorities,&quot; said Nestor Michnyak, a spokesman for the F.B.I. &quot;Do we have any different, modified response? No, is the bottom line.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;We respond -- that&#39;s the problem,&quot; he said. &quot;We can offer advice on what we&#39;re finding, based on experience and what history is showing, but everybody is responsible for themselves.&quot;</p>
826067>F.A.A. Decisions Linked To Air Computer Problems The nation&#39;s air traffic control system suffers long, costly breakdowns not just because it is old, but also because poor decisions by the Federal Aviation  Administration have left the agency ill-prepared to maintain the 30-year-old computers, the National Transportation Safety Board said today. The board began its investigation last spring after major breakdowns at the Chicago Center, one of 20 regional centers that handle high-altitude long distance flights. It said yesterday that most of the breakdowns posed very little risk of accident, only the certainty of flights delayed for hours or canceled.  <p>But it added that controllers need more training in what to do when their equipment suddenly breaks down and some information disappears from their screens. And the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better, the board said. For 30 percent of the time, the system is one failure away from breakdown, the board said.</p> <p>&quot;Right now, they don&#39;t have the capacity to take care of the problem the way  they should,&quot; said Bernard S. Loeb, director of the office of aviation safety at the board, an independent investigatory body with the power to make recommendations to the F.A.A., the Government agency that runs the air traffic system.</p> <p>In the mid-80&#39;s the F.A.A. slowed hiring and stopped training new technicians for the equipment, because it anticipated replacing the equipment by the mid-80&#39;s, Mr. Loeb said. But the replacements are still on the drawing board and now there are too few technicians. &quot;They should have realized they were probably going to go into a crunch,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Robert Benzon, the board&#39;s chief investigator in the project, said that the controllers had had very little training in directing airplanes without the computerized features that their system was supposed to provide. Only those who  work midnight shifts, when traffic is light and parts of the computers are shut  down for maintenance or repairs, are familiar with the proper procedure, which includes counting the planes on the screen to make sure none are missing.</p> <p>When a failure begins, he said, a controller will call out: &quot;Help! Who worked the last midnight shift? We need some help over here.&quot;</p> <p>He added, &quot;The contingency plans in place don&#39;t seem to be fully understood by the folks that need them.&quot;</p> <p>The F.A.A. said in a statement today that it &quot;already has actions under way to address recommendations issued by the National Transportation Safety Board.&quot;  The agency noted that it hired more technicians last year and sent out videotapes showing controllers how to make the necessary adjustments when the computers break down. It is developing a computer-based training program, the agency said.</p> <p>The safety board said that the frequency of breakdowns was not increasing much, but that each breakdown tended to last longer now, because of staff problems. On many night shifts there is no technician on duty, a situation that  Mr. Benzon called &quot;anathema.&quot;</p> <p>But, Mr. Benzon said, it was unavoidable because the number of trained technicians has dwindled. The F.A.A., which had not intended to train any more because it has long planned to replace the equipment, recently started several technicians on a two-year course in maintenance of the old computers.</p> <p>But the remaining technicians are doing a heroic job, he said. He displayed a palm-sized electronic circuit board, intended by the manufacturer to be replaced if it ever broke, but no longer available because the computer is so old. When this one broke, a technician tried to fix it by re-wiring it. &quot;Whoever did this  needs an Academy Award for soldering,&quot; Mr. Benzon said.</p> <p>In a modern computer, he said, the circuits on that board would fit &quot;on the head of a pin.&quot;</p> <p>About the time the safety board began its investigation, the F.A.A. commissioned an outside panel of experts and an internal review team to examine  why it had had so many breakdowns. Last Friday, knowing that the safety board would release its report soon, the F.A.A. released its own two reports and said  it was working on a long list of recommendations to improve its performance.</p> <p>Today it distributed a statement that said it &quot;already has actions under way  to address recommendations issued by the National Transportation Safety Board&quot; even before the board voted its recommendations. One board member, John T. Goglia, showing annoyance that there was reaction before his board had taken action, said just before the vote to issue the recommendations, &quot;The F.A.A. has  clearly transcended the electronic age and moved into clairvoyance.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;They would be well served if they could apply some of that clearly unusual talent towards addressing problems of air traffic control outages,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe they could predict them so they could be prepared with they occur.&quot;</p>
1289782>Agency Warns Of Fuel Pump On Boeing 737 The Federal Aviation Administration  told airlines today to stop using a fuel pump on the Boeing 737 under certain circumstances after investigators found that the pump might have contributed to the explosion of a plane at a gate in Bangkok last month.  <p>The agency told the airlines not to run the pump in the center fuel tank when the tank was empty or nearly so. Investigators believe that was the situation in Bangkok.</p> <p>The Thai explosion occurred shortly before boarding was to begin; a flight attendant was killed. Thai authorities said they suspected sabotage, but no trace of explosives was found. Another 737 exploded on a runway in Manila in May 1990.</p> <p>American investigators have compared the Thai explosion with the explosion in flight of T.W.A. 800, a Boeing 747, a few minutes after it left Kennedy Airport on July 17, 1996. In both cases, the airplane sat on the ground on a warm day with the air-conditioners running. In the Boeing design, the heat from air-conditioning is dissipated by devices under the center fuel tank, and warms the tank.  Heating the tank turns the fuel to vapor, which can explode if a spark is present.</p> <p>The phenomenon was not well understood before the T.W.A. 800 crash, which killed all 230 people aboard when the center tank exploded. Investigators do not believe that pumps were running on that airplane, although the tank was nearly empty, which could allow an explosive vapor to develop.</p> <p>Fuel pumps are designed to be submerged in fuel, which lubricates and cools them. In the 737, the pump delivers fuel to a piping system that feeds the engines on the wings, but if it pumps the tank dry or nearly so, it can overheat and provide a spark,  experts say.</p> <p>Some people involved in the investigation in Thailand say the pump was running and the tank was empty, but a report has not yet been issued.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;When you run them when they&#39;re dry, bearings wear out, you get metal rubbing on metal, and you get heat,&#39;&#39; an F.A.A. official said.</p> <p>Boeing, which has long recommended not running the pump if the tank is dry, sent out a reminder to 737 operators worldwide on April 11 in response to the Thai explosion.</p>
59320>Key PBS Station Lags In Fund-Raising Efforts Contributions to WGBH, the public-television station here whose productions are a mainstay of public stations nationwide, lagged badly in fund-raising efforts in March, leading a national trend.  <p>With six weeks left in its fiscal year, the station has reported that it is $2.5 million short of its fund-raising goal, $500,000 farther from its fund-raising goal than it was at the same time last year.</p> <p>Around the country, 77 stations did worse in fund-raising during March 1987 than in March 1986, according to the Public Broadcasting System in Washington; 59 stations reported gains.</p> <p>WGBH is the nation&#39;s second-largest public television station, second in revenues and programming to WNET in New York. That station is not showing a decline; in its last fiscal year, which ended June 30, WNET raised $23.4 million, about $1 million more than the previous year. An Outmoded Technique?  Public television experts have advanced a variety of explanations for the nationwide decrease, including the new tax code and technological advances from cable television and videocassette recorders to remote-control channel changers. But they admit that they are unable to determine which factors are important. Some wonder if on-air fund raising, a device that viewers find about as entertaining as tooth flossing, is losing its effectiveness.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Has this technique worn itself out?&#39;&#39; asked the chairman of the National Association of Public Television Stations, Richard E. Ottinger, in a telephone interview. Many stations find that their loyal viewers are bored with the marathons, according to public-television officials.</p> <p>Many public-television stations hold their major fund drives in March. According to PBS, this year they collected $35.5 million from individuals and families, down 4.3 percent from the 1986 figure of $37.1 million. The number of donors was 651,000, down 7.4 percent from 1985, when 703,000 gave. No Layoffs, No Cutbacks</p> <p>At WGBH, the drop was sharper. The March drive was down about 17 percent, bringing in just under $1 million, compared with $1.2 million last year, according to Roberta MacCarthy, director of development, who called the fund raising &#39;&#39;very soft.&#39;&#39; The goal was $1.3 million, she said. The number of donors was 18,000, down 28 percent from the 25,000 last year, she said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;WGBH is an extremely strong station,&#39;&#39; Mr. Ottinger said. &#39;&#39;If they&#39;re having troubles, I don&#39;t know what it spells for the rest of us.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The station, which produces such public television staples as &#39;&#39;Nova,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Frontline,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;This Old House&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;The Victory Garden,&#39;&#39; has not had layoffs or cutbacks. It still appears to win exceptionally strong support in the television market here. The station estimates that one out of every five WGBH viewers contributes, compared with a national average of 1 in 10 public television viewers. In its last fiscal year, which ended Aug. 31, 1986, the station raised $11.6 million from viewers and listeners, and $1.6 million from its on-air auction. Another $33.7 million came from contracts and grants, many from major corporate sponsors, and $3.5 million from the Federal Government, a source that is declining. WGBH is experimenting with videocassette sales and other unconventional sources of income.</p> <p>The city is proud of the station, according to Boston&#39;s Commissioner of Arts and Humanities, Bruce B. Rossley. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a major cultural institution in this city - as much as any electronic media outlet can be,&#39;&#39; he said. Decline&#39;s Cause Is Unclear</p> <p>The cause of the fund-raising problem in Boston, and at other stations with declining revenues, is difficult to identify, according to officials. But they theorize that they are being hurt by two technologies that are also diminishing audiences for commercial network television: cable television and videocassette recorders. Because public television viewers are generally more affluent, VCR&#39;s are more likely to be found in the homes of WGBH viewers than in all households with television, according to station officials, and that does not help the station.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You have &#39;zapping&#39; a lot,&#39;&#39; said the station&#39;s chief financial officer, Andrew S. Griffiths, referring to a term often used to mean fast-forwarding through commercials, or simply switching to another channel. When WGBH is &#39;&#39;zapped,&#39;&#39; what is missed is fund-raising appeals.</p> <p>Mr. Griffiths also believes that public television does worse when the economy is better, falling with a rising economy and prospering when its viewers have less money. &#39;&#39;When they have a lot of money they are out amusing themselves; when they don&#39;t, they&#39;re home watching TV,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Mr. Ottinger, who is also director of the Georgia State Television Network, traces the problem to remote-control channel changers, which he said are now in 70 percent of all homes with television. &#39;&#39;If you can sit in your chair and someone comes on with a 10-minute pitch for fund raising, it&#39;s easy to flip through the channels,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We may even lose people who get interested in something else.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The change in the tax code may also be a factor, according to Ward B. Chamberlin, president of WETA, in Washington. Mr. Chamberlin said his station pushed harder in December, emphasizing that donations that month were worth more to the donor than those in March.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;From our point of view the March schedule of programming was not that exciting,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We didn&#39;t have a &#39;Jewel in the Crown.&#39; &#39;&#39; But, he said, a direct-mail campaign later in the spring was successful, and for the year, fund raising was up.</p> <p>One reason that response to on-air appeals is down, according to PBS, is that viewers do not like seeing so much of it, and stations want to please them.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;In an attempt to be responsive to many of those currently supporting public TV, you can do less on-air fund raising,&#39;&#39; said Michael B. Soper, PBS senior vice president for development. &#39;&#39;Many stations are experimenting with doing less,&#39;&#39; he said, adding that in 1987, the total time for on-air fund raising was about 3.3 percent less than the year earlier.</p>
191740>Nuclear Arms Plants: A Bill Long Overdue LIKE O-rings on a shuttle booster or rusting bolts on a highway bridge, weaknesses long overlooked in the nuclear weapons industry are now being recognized as precursors to a potential disaster. Recent plant shutdowns have broken fragile links in the production chain, impairing the country&#39;s ability to maintain its nuclear stockpile and raising far-ranging concerns about human health and safety.  <p>Why did it take so long for the problems to come to the attention of Government managers? What are the lessons to be learned?</p> <p>After a string of revelations in recent weeks about hazardous operations, John S. Herrington, who has expressed concern for safety since becoming Secretary of Energy three and a half years ago, now asserts that long-accepted attitudes and practices at the nuclear sites are unacceptable. This has set the stage for an overhaul in the way the Government conducts its nuclear business.</p> <p>The bomb production complex, parts of which date from the Manhattan Project in the 1940&#39;s, has been showing its age for years. But the interruptions of the last two months are unprecedented. At the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, all three reactors that make tritium, a vital and perishable ingredient of nuclear weapons, have been shut down because of safety problems. One could be re-started but officials are apprehensive about the ability of the operators to run it; in August, while attempting to re-start the plant, they caused a small but potentially dangerous power surge.  A Series of Revelations</p> <p>Workers at the Feed Materials Production Center at Fernald, near Cincinnati, where uranium is baked into a metal form for use as reactor fuel, are on strike for higher pay and safer working conditions. Dumping and release of uranium dust into the air from the Ohio plant have been known about for years. But recently, in a suit by neighbors against the contractor who ran the plant for decades, the Energy Department filed papers saying that the Government released the material deliberately.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the department said it had temporarily closed part of its plutonium processing site at Rocky Flats, Colo., after three people were exposed to radioactivity when they entered an area where men in protective gear were cleaning up plutonium contamination. As at Savannah River, the problem is thought to indicate deeper flaws in procedures and lax attitudes.</p> <p>In January 1987, the department closed its biggest reactor, a plutonium producer, in Hanford, Wash., for safety reasons, and this summer a water leak delayed the opening of the department&#39;s first permanent repository for nuclear waste in a salt cavern near Carlsbad, N.M., once again raising the question of what to do with debris that will be hazardous for thousands of years. Last week, the Governor of Idaho asserted that he would turn back waste from Rocky Flats, which is only capable of safely storing a three-month accumulation.</p> <p>The loss of the Hanford reactor is not critical, because stockpiles of plutonium are adequate. But the shutdown of the Savannah River reactors has more serious consequences. Tritium, the prime fuel of hydrogen bombs and an important ingredient of uranium bombs, turns into unusable helium at a rate of 5.5 percent a year; tritium decay is a mechanism for unintentional disarmament. Fernald and Rocky Flats are essential for producing new weapons, but unlike Savannah River their operation is not required to keep existing bombs ready.</p> <p>Revelations of operating problems in the industry have come more quickly since a joint Congressional hearing on Sept. 30. House and Senate aides disclosed a 1985 memorandum from E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, which built the Savannah River Plant in the early 1950&#39;s and has operated it ever since. The memo, which ranked the 30 worst incidents at Savannah, was written to show progress in safety, pointing out that the most serious incidents were becoming less frequent.</p> <p>But for Congress and other outsiders, the memo&#39;s content came as a shock. A safety campaign undertaken by Mr. Herrington in September 1985 has gained attention and momentum, putting a number of the production complex&#39;s fundamental problems in sharp relief. Among the lessons that have been learned:</p> <p>* Secrecy has led to complacency. Veiled by national security concerns, the bomb makers were never troubled by the hard lessons learned by the civilian nuclear complex. &#39;&#39;Du Pont had the idea there was nobody in the universe who could tell them anything,&#39;&#39; Mr. Herrington said in an interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times last week.</p> <p>* The regulated and the regulators became one. The 300 Energy Department people at Savannah River worked so closely with Du Pont personnel, Mr. Herrington said, that he could not tell which group was which. At civilian plants, by contrast, the Government, in the form of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, functions in a somewhat adversarial role. &#39;&#39;The Nuclear Regulatory Commission may be a toothless watchdog, but at least they&#39;ve got a watchdog,&#39;&#39; said Frances Close Hart, the director of the Energy Research Foundation, a nonprofit environmental group in Columbia, S.C.</p> <p>* Political appointees were far removed from day-to-day operations. At first, top officials of the Energy Department - all relatively new to their Government posts - contended that the incidents at Savannah had been suppressed by Du Pont. The department later said that, in fact, reports of the 30 incidents and even the memo ranking them were in the hands of the department and its predecessor agencies soon after they were written. Many of the 30 incidents were widely known; two had been reported in a front-page article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1981.</p> <p>The breakdown in institutional memory was accompanied by a serious lack of foresight. The operable reactors for making tritium are not certain to last another decade, the time probably needed to build a replacement. But the Reagan Administration did not request a replacement until last month.</p> <p>John F. Ahearne, who was named to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission just before the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and who is now the head of a new advisory committee at the Department of Energy, predicts that the current period of examination will shake up the military side of the industry as the Pennsylvania accident did the civilian sector. &#39;&#39;The Three Mile Island shock took three or four years to work its way through,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;I expect this will, too.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Also working its way through the system are estimates of what it will cost to clean up, rebuild and run the industry in an environmentally sound manner. This summer, the General Accounting Office and the Department of Energy estimated the price at more than $170 billion. Paying the deferred costs for warheads made years ago has never been as attractive, for the executive branch or for Congress, as ordering new weapons systems.</p> <p>HOT SPOTS</p>
163620>Oil Price Rises Sharply; Outlook Called Unclear The price of oil jumped sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday on the expectation that an end to Persian Gulf hostilities would enhance the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to limit its output and raise prices.  <p>But experts differed on the long-term impact of a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq, if one is consummated. Some said that prices could even fall further if the eight-year-old war ended and both sides rebuilt their oil operations and focused on oil exports for funds to rebuild their economies.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;This is the first-blush reaction,&#39;&#39; Daniel Yergin, an energy analyst, said of the price rise. &#39;&#39;But the two belligerents, particularly Iran, will have a lot of incentive to produce more oil and get more revenue now.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Oil prices had been declining for days on reports that several Persian Gulf nations were producing beyond their quotas, even Saudi Arabia, the largest member of OPEC. A Dollar Higher at One Point</p> <p>As a result, West Texas intermediate, the American benchmark crude that is traded on the mercantile exchange, was under $15 for most of last week. Oil for delivery next month closed yesterday at $15.70, up 84 cents from Friday&#39;s close, after trading more than a dollar higher at one point.</p> <p>On international markets, North Sea Brent oil was trading 60 cents a barrel higher, at $14.95.</p> <p>When the hostilities between Iran and Iraq spilled over into attacks on each others&#39; oil installations and tankers carrying each others&#39; oil, oil prices went up.</p> <p>But the war eventually pushed prices down, by creating instability within OPEC. Both sides have been pumping oil hard, desperate for revenue, and Iraq has refused to be bound by production quotas, adding to a worldwide glut that has sent prices back down. Other Problems Expected</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Iraq will no longer be able to use its war effort as an excuse,&#39;&#39; said Shahrokh Nikkhah, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers. But the end of the war would bring other problems, he and others suggested. &#39;&#39;There will be tremendous pressure from within for the governments of Iran and Iraq to revamp and rebuild their economies,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Their only source of investment money is crude exports.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>As for a cutback in output, he said he thought that was unlikely, pointing out that Iraq has grown accustomed to 2.5 million or 2.6 million barrels a day.</p> <p>Others saw the development as positive for oil prices. According to Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., chairman and chief executive of the Coastal Corporation, a Houston-based independent oil company, &#39;&#39;the money they need to rebuild won&#39;t be nearly as expensive as the money for weapons.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The end of the war will remove a key point of dissension inside OPEC, he said. &#39;&#39;If this stops the political maneuvering between the Saudis, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi and Iran, what you will have is a more stable oil market,&#39;&#39; he added.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The Iranians and the Iraqis will be almost honor-bound to agree to take the same quota,&#39;&#39; he predicted. &#39;&#39;If that occurs, the market price will escalate to $18 to $20 or higher.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But the simple act of ending hostilities will also allow the two sides to rebuild their oil operations. &#39;&#39;They will be adding 4 or 4.5 million barrels per day of capacity,&#39;&#39; said William L. Fisher, director of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin. That quantity would be 8 or 9 percent of the amount of oil in world trade. Bigger Oversupply Predicted</p> <p>The Iraqis have been producing about 2 million barrels but had a pre-war capacity of 3.5 million, Dr. Fisher added; the Iranians have been pumping 2.4 million and had a capacity of 6 million. &#39;&#39;All this does, it seems to me, is add to the problem of oversupply,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Robert Boslego, a Boston-based oil analyst, suggested that the price of oil might have been poised for an increase independent of yesterday&#39;s news.</p> <p>The reports last week of higher OPEC production were not reflected in tanker charters, he said, and prices had fallen too low for the actual supply-demand balance. In addition, he pointed out, statistics released by the American Petroleum Institute last week showed that crude stocks fell by 3.8 million barrels, reducing the surplus that has held prices down.</p>
636564>Office Trash: Next Target For Recycling The next battleground in the fight to reduce New York City&#39;s waste is the trash basket at work, be it in an office, a restaurant or a factory. Starting on Sept. 30, the paper from office workers&#39; desks, the aluminum-foil food containers used by restaurants and even the newspapers that hotel guests throw out will have to be separated for recycling. New city regulations will require recycling of just over half of the garbage created by businesses in the five boroughs, although the amount actually recovered will be substantially less, especially at first.  <p>People in the waste industry say that blue bins for the disposal of various materials will be placed in all offices in the city and that people who put wastes in the wrong containers will be asked to mend their ways, beginning with written messages from night-time cleaning staffs.  Habits Are Hard to Change</p> <p>Experts in the field say the hard part is changing people&#39;s habits.</p> <p>&quot;We start with stickers on peoples&#39; desks that say, &#39;We noticed trash in your recycling bin,&#39; &quot; said Richard Fuller, president of Great Forest, a consulting concern that helps landlords comply with the new regulations. Repeat offenders may get face-to-face requests, he said.</p> <p>Emily Lloyd, the Sanitation Commissioner, said that she expects the program to work because of the commercial interests of the waste haulers who have to resell the materials or use them themselves. Material for recycling is seldom pure, but if offices supply material with too high a level of contaminants, she said, &quot;your carter will get cranky.&quot;</p> <p>Companies that violate the law may be fined up to $500, but for the first six months, Ms. Lloyd&#39;s department will simply issue warnings giving companies time to organize their trash.</p> <p>Under current regulations, city businesses can combine different kinds of trash, with waste haulers responsible for separating material that can be recycled. But food wastes and other &quot;wet&quot; garbage contaminate some material that could otherwise be recycled, experts say. The new rules will put the burden squarely on offices, restaurants, stores and other businesses that collectively create 12,000 tons of waste a day, about 45 percent of the city total. They are still allowed, however, to mix categories of recyclable materials. For example, an office could mix high-grade office paper with newspapers, for separation later.</p> <p>Some buildings already comply with the new rules, but many are scrambling. &quot;I&#39;ve never been busier, with a tremendous outcry for information,&quot; said Ernest C. Hoch, senior vice president of marketing at V. Ponte &amp; Sons, a waste-hauling company that runs its own paper recycling mill in Clifton, N.J.</p> <p>None of the new recycling will save much space at the city&#39;s sole remaining landfill, because nearly all business waste is trucked by private haulers to private landfills. But city officials say those days may be numbered, because most of those landfills are outside New York State and a movement is growing to let states ban trash imports. More Interstate Restrictions</p> <p>&quot;In the end, there will be many more restrictions on the interstate transportation of garbage,&quot; said Ms. Lloyd, the Commissioner of Sanitation. &quot;The last time the U.S. Senate voted on the issue, it was 96-to-0,&quot; she said, explaining that except for New York and New Jersey, senators from all states had voted to allow restrictions on trash exports. &quot;But next time,&quot; she said, &quot;New Jersey may not vote with us, because they&#39;ve brought on some capacity of their own.&quot;</p> <p>A more immediate reason for the new procedures is a 1988 state law that requires separation at the source of materials for which there is a market. Under pressure from the Legislature in Albany and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, New York City concluded a year ago that the current system did not meet the 1988 law.</p> <p>While the new rules may make life more complicated, they may also help landlords turn a profit.</p> <p>For example, at 330 Madison Avenue, which fills the west side of the block from 42d to 43d, a basement room fills up every day with the 40 to 50 cubic yards of waste from the 5,000 workers on 36 tenant floors.</p> <p>Before recycling, it was all hauled away at a cost of $14.70 a cubic yard, or about $10 for each of the hamperlike dollies. Under a system created by Mr. Fuller, of Great Forest, some dollies are filled with white paper and sold for about $4 each, turning part of the waste stream into income.</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s no longer garbage,&quot; said the building manager, Richard B. Wallace. &quot;It&#39;s a commodity, a product for us.&quot; Collecting the materials separately requires more effort, he said, but &quot;the tenant does most of the work for us.&quot; Calls From Tenants</p> <p>Mr. Wallace, who works for the Mendik Realty Company, which runs the building, said that before recycling started, he got two or three calls a week from tenants asking when a recycling program would begin.</p> <p>Mr. Wallace&#39;s building has separate bins for beverage containers but these are not required. In a significant concession to the real-estate industry, materials that could be recycled but are a minor part of business wastes are exempted. For example, an office building like Mr. Wallace&#39;s must separate office paper, but not soda cans and bottles. A restaurant, on the other hand, must recycle beverage containers, but need not bother with office paper.</p> <p>That compromise exempted about 3.2 percent of the waste stream from recycling, Ms. Lloyd said, but it also won the support of the city&#39;s real-estate industry. John A. Doyle, vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said that concession, plus a clause that lets businesses mix their recyclable materials for separation later, had resulted in &quot;an effective recycling system that is also quite simple.&quot; Many businesses had feared that they would have to have separate bins for each category of material, including white paper, colored paper, corrugated cardboard, cans, clear glass and green glass. An Easier System</p> <p>At V. Ponte, Mr. Hoch said an easier system for landlords in office buildings was to have a few traditional garbage cans around, for wastes like the remains of a lunch eaten at a desk, while the containers next to workers&#39; desks were for clean waste paper. &quot;This is inverting the system most people are accustomed to,&quot; he said. &quot;But there is less volume of nonpaper waste in a building than of paper.&quot; His company would then sort the recyclable materials.</p> <p>Some buildings, though, separate those materials to save money.</p> <p>At the Environmental Defense Fund, James T. B. Tripp, the general counsel and an expert on solid waste, said he supported the new regulations. &quot;They&#39;ll certainly make businesses big and small much more conscious of the importance of recycling,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But he said New York was likely to need the ability to pick recyclable material out of trash anyway, because the recycling rate for residential and commercial garbage was too low.</p> <p>According to the Sanitation Department, residential recycling, which is now citywide, recovers only 10 percent of the potential material in some areas and 75 percent in others, with a citywide capture rate of 42 percent. No one is sure what the rate is for commercial waste under current rules, but estimates are 20 to 30 percent of the potential maximum; the goal is a 62 percent capture rate by the year 2000.</p>
1312756>Bush Ponders Aid for Only Domestic Supplier of Reactor Fuel With Soviet-era nuclear weapons now providing more than half the uranium that powers American nuclear power plants, the Bush administration is weighing whether to provide support for the only American company that enriches uranium for reactor fuel. The under secretary of energy, Robert G. Card, told Congress last week that the administration was evaluating whether it was &#39;&#39;economically feasible or necessary&#39;&#39; to produce fuel domestically for nuclear reactors, or whether the country could reliably import uranium from Russia and elsewhere. Another possibility is that other American companies will enter the business.  <p>The only domestic company that carries out a crucial processing step that results in enriched uranium, the United States Enrichment Corporation, is plagued by high costs at its 49-year-old factory, and competition from Russia and Western Europe. The administration is facing a decision on whether it should subsidize development of new technology to ensure a domestic supply of the fuel.</p> <p>The nuclear power industry, which supplies about 20 percent of the nation&#39;s electricity, had used self-sufficiency in uranium fuel as a major selling point for years.</p> <p>The existence of a healthy domestic uranium industry was a premise of the 1993 agreement to buy highly enriched uranium from Russia for use in American power plants, and of a law that privatized the government&#39;s uranium processing plants. That law requires the president to certify annually that the domestic industry is &#39;&#39;viable.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But the United States Enrichment Corporation has closed one of its two plants and is threatened by rising prices for electricity, flat demand for its services and competition from more efficient plants in Europe.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;ve already lost self-sufficiency,&#39;&#39; said Representative Ted Strickland, Democrat of Ohio, whose district includes the plant that was closed by the company. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re in danger of losing the capacity even to maintain a domestic industry.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Strickland is seeking federal money to develop new enrichment technology, but industry experts say the price may be too high.</p> <p>John R. Longenecker, a consultant and a former deputy assistant secretary of energy, offered a dim view of the company&#39;s future. &#39;&#39;They&#39;re stuck with the highest cost of production,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;the oldest production capacity and no proven advanced technology, even if they could borrow the money to build it.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The United States has spent $7 billion on two advanced technologies that were deemed impractical. Company officials say they are exploring another advanced system.</p> <p>Other experts suggest that the Bush energy plan, and public statements by Vice President Dick Cheney supporting construction of new reactors, will ring hollow if the fuel is imported. The domestic mining industry has been withering away for years, largely because of lower-cost producers in Canada, Australia and elsewhere, but the importance of mining has waned as prices of uranium ore have declined.</p> <p>What is at stake is a processing step called enrichment. The two plants sold by the government in 1998 were built to accept uranium with the two most common forms, uranium-238 and uranium-235, and sort them to raise the proportion of uranium-235, which is most useful in nuclear reactors and bombs. The technology used at both plants, gaseous diffusion, was developed during World War II, to make the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Newer systems developed in Europe and the former Soviet Union are cheaper to operate; some use only one-fifth as much electricity.</p> <p>One reason the market for enrichment is depressed is that the United States agreed in 1993 to buy highly enriched uranium from Russia, with a uranium-235 content of more than 90 percent, to be blended down to the 5 percent level used by nuclear reactors. The idea was to take weapons material out of circulation and give the Russian nuclear program hard currency to keep Russian scientists and the material itself out of the hands of other countries.</p> <p>The company said that by the end of March it had received the equivalent of more than 4,500 warheads in the form of uranium for power plants.</p> <p>But because of commercial disputes, Russia has interrupted shipments four times. Charles Yulish, a company spokesman, said he believed that Russia would be a stable supplier in coming years because the company&#39;s payments, about $500 million a year, were &#39;&#39;a very big factor in Russian revenues.&#39;&#39; A long-term contract is awaiting approval by the White House, Mr. Yulish said.</p>
583025>Accord With Cree Will Allow Quebec Utility to Finish Dams Hydro-Quebec, the provincial utility that is a major supplier of electricity to New York State, has signed an agreement with the Grand Council of the Cree and two Cree Indian communities on compensation payments for environmental damage, allowing the electric company to finish a giant hydroelectric project in the remote James Bay region. Under the agreement, which was signed in Montreal on Friday after two years of negotiations, the utility will pay the Cree $50 million &quot;for various community and economic activities&quot; including recreational centers and public works. The Cree will drop lawsuits that sought to block the project.  <p>The agreement allows the completion of two dams with a combined capacity of 1,152 megawatts, which is about the capacity of the largest nuclear reactor in New York State. The dams and associated power lines, which are already under construction, will cost about $4 billion (Canadian) and will be finished by 1998, according to Guy Versailles, a spokesman for the company.</p> <p>The power will serve Quebec&#39;s internal demand, he said. As a practical matter, however, the more electricity the province generates, the more it has available for export. Part of La Grande Project</p> <p>The dams are part of the La Grande project on the La Grande River, 600 miles north of Montreal. They are not part of the Great Whale project, which Quebec said last year it would delay because New York State canceled an agreement to buy more electricity. Environmentalists in New York had pushed for the cancellation because of fear of adverse effects on the Cree and on wildlife.</p> <p>Mr. Versailles said that Hydro-Quebec took the position that it had the contractual right to finish the project under agreements signed in 1975. But the 1975 agreement also provided that &quot;we would negotiate with the communities for mitigation measures, remedial measures for negative impacts,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Of the $50 million, 73 percent will go to Chisasibi, which has a population of 2,500 and is the largest Cree settlement, and 17 percent will go to Wemindji, with a population of 1,000; the balance will go to the Grand Council of the Cree, the company said.</p>
243448>Exxon Says Natural Actions Cleaned Two-Thirds of Spill What man has done and has tried fecklessley to undo here for almost a month, nature is undoing instead.  <p>Two-thirds of the oil that spilled here four weeks ago is gone, most by natural action, Exxon said Thursday. And the company told the state in a report Wednesday that so much of the remaining oil had washed onto the beaches or otherwise disappeared from the surface that little additional cleanup of the water is possible.</p> <p>Only 4,000 barrels, about 2 percent of the spill, can still be recovered from the waters of Prince William Sound, Exxon said.</p> <p>But that does not mean the environmental threat has ended. Even by Exxon&#39;s latest reckoning, which has not been challenged by the Federal and state agencies monitoring the cleanup, tens of thousands of barrels of oil still float in Alaska&#39;s waters and could inflict further damage to the shoreline.</p> <p>Some of it has worked its way beyond Prince William Sound and turned into Cook Inlet, which stretches to Anchorage. And some has traveled more than 250 miles from the spot where the Exxon Valdez went aground on March 24 in the most devastating oil-tanker spill in the nation&#39;s history. Local officials have said the immediate risk to shore areas is unlikely to pass entirely for months.</p> <p>The cleanup effort supervised by Exxon continues to make little headway; Dennis Stanczuk, a company spokesman, said Thursday that cleaning crews had finished 2,100 feet of beach. That would leave 304.5 miles, under Exxon&#39;s cleanup plan. Thousands of additional miles of the rugged coast were judged &#39;&#39;inappropriate for manual cleanup,&#39;&#39; Mr. Stanczuk said. Tour of the Sound</p> <p>A three-and-a-half-hour helicopter trip around Prince William Sound on Thursday, organized by the Coast Guard for three United States Representatives and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., showed continued heavy evidence of oil, but also signs of recovery.</p> <p>Large areas of Prince William Sound glittered in the unhealthy rainbow colors of oil sheen. Swirling around the surface were clumps of heavier oil turned a pinkish brown. Fishing boats, working mostly in pairs, towed lines of booms between them to capture what oil they could.</p> <p>In the vastness of the sound, the effort seemed like taking a hand-held vacuum cleaner to a football field.</p> <p>Yet despite all the oil, the sound was clearly alive. Bald eagles still perched and soared; waterfowl were swimming and flying. Killer whales or porpoises, it was difficult to tell which from 400 feet, swam through the waters. Otters and Aircraft</p> <p>The number of otters visible was up from a few weeks ago, but scientists still held to their estimate that a quarter of the 10,000 otters in the sound before the spill may die from the oil.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They&#39;re getting used to the aircraft and they don&#39;t dive as quick,&#39;&#39; said Jerry Galt, a scientist with the Hazardous Material Response Branch of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Mr. Galt played tour guide to Mr. Lujan and Don Young, Alaska&#39;s Representative in the House. Two other Congressional Republicans, Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania and Elton Gallegly of California, flew on a second helicopter with a reporter.</p> <p>The delegation circled the Exxon Valdez, still undergoing repairs. It was surrounded by four tugboats, and listing slightly to port.</p> <p>The lawmakers also visited a beach on the shores of McPherson Bay on Naked Island, near where the Exxon Valdez ran aground, and were generally encouraged by the cleanup there. Mr. Lujan, however, reserved judgment. &#39;&#39;I can&#39;t be a 20-minute expert,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>He and the members of the House posed for photos with a worker who was aiming a high-pressure hose. The hose and other flushing devices were being used to wash the oil down to the water, where it was being contained in booms and collected. &#39;Down to Medium-Oiled&#39;</p> <p>Large patches of the gray rock were drenched in black oil, although the smell was mostly gone; a Congressional aide who had visited the site just after the spill said the amount of oil was sharply reduced.</p> <p>The state and Exxon are planning to clean the dirtiest stretches of beach, but they do not hope to restore them to pristine condition. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s better when we clean the heavily oiled beaches, and get them down to medium-oiled,&#39;&#39; said the state co-ordinator, William D. (Pete) McGee. The workers simply lack the ability to clean up completely, he said, and working on the worst beaches reduced the amount of oil that escaped back into the water.</p> <p>Exxon is still short of skimmers, pumping units, crews and floating accommodations to house them, he said. The company says 1,700 workers are on the job now and the number should reach 4,000 by June. About 51 miles of booms are in place, the company said. Despite the limited amount of recoverable oil left, there are 320 vessels in service, including a new Soviet skimmer, and 25 aircraft, the company said.</p> <p>Exxon has recovered about 31,000 barrels, or 13 percent of the oil spilled, but nature is doing better, according to the company. The biggest gains have come from evaporation (84,000 barrels, 35 percent of the amount spilled); burning (19,000 barrels, 8 percent); biological breakdown (12,000 barrels, 5 percent) and disintegration (12,000 barrels, 5 percent.) A barrel is equal to 42 gallons.</p>
754836>Was the Pilot Drunk? DNA Might Tell Of 975 pilots killed in plane crashes in the United States in 1989 and 1990, the Federal Aviation Administration found alcohol in tissue samples from about 8 percent. But how many of those 79 pilots were actually flying under the influence? About a quarter definitely were and about a quarter were not, according to a re-analysis of tissue samples of the pilots, nearly all of whom were private pilots in general aviation planes. But for 36 of the 79, no clear determination was possible.  <p>Now the aviation agency is looking for a quick, reliable test that will categorize the source of the alcohol where existing tests leave the results unclear. The likely technology is DNA analysis.</p> <p>The test is not on the alcohol itself, because alcohol is the same regardless of the source. Dr. Bruce A. Roe, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Oklahoma who is working to develop the test, said, &quot;ethanol is ethanol is ethanol.&quot;</p> <p>But investigators have realized for some time that it can come from two distinctly different sources. One is obvious: alcohol drunk by the pilot before the crash. The other, now coming to be more fully appreciated, is through fermentation -- action on human remains by bacteria that make ethanol as waste.</p> <p>&quot;The moment the system is dead, you have all this activity,&quot; said Dennis V. Canfield, manager of the toxicology and accident research laboratory of the agency&#39;s Civil Aeromedical Institute here. The bacteria are generally present in air and water, and if the weather at the crash scene is warm enough, they will produce alcohol within hours.</p> <p>It is the bacteria that would be typed by DNA.</p> <p>Bacterial action takes place too slowly to make it of much importance for testing people killed in car crashes, whose remains are usually found quickly. In addition, even after the most violent incidents investigators are generally able to obtain blood samples, and the blood is generally not heavily contaminated by environmental factors. In plane wrecks, though, damage is such that investigators can sometimes find only body tissue, not blood, and often it has been thoroughly exposed to the environment for extended periods.</p> <p>Such examinations pose several problems; one is uncertainty about the identity of tissue samples. The aviation agency recently opened a DNA laboratory here to insure that when it tests a sample for alcohol, the sample comes from a pilot and not a passenger. In one recent crash in which DNA identification was used, the largest available body part was the sole of the foot, agency experts said.</p> <p>The DNA tests used to establish the identity of remains are less stringent than those used in criminal cases. Crash investigators usually request hair or other samples from next of kin, and check for a close match. Tissue samples are always tested after commercial accidents. The Air Line Pilots Association, the largest of the unions for the commercial pilots, has complained about the DNA procedure, because the request to next-of-kin of necessity always comes right after a crash. The request itself is stressful and the test should not be used routinely, the pilots argue. Thus far their arguments have been unsuccessful.</p> <p>Toxicologists have known for years that alcohol can be produced after death, and had suggested two methods for discriminating between drunken flying and fermented remains, but recent work by the laboratory here casts doubt on the reliability of both methods. One is the volume of alcohol, with low volumes thought to indicate fermentation. The other is the presence of volatile organic chemicals, which researchers had believed the bacteria produced along with alcohol.</p> <p>As a definitive measure, the researchers here sampled urine and vitreous humor, the fluid in the eye, and concluded that if either one tested positive it would indicate that alcohol had been ingested. In a healthy person, urine will not sustain the bacteria that make alcohol, because it has no nutrients. And the vitreous is sterile.</p> <p>In 36 of the 79 cases, neither of these liquids was available for testing, and thus there was no positive determination.</p> <p>But the tissue tests showed that the volatile chemicals, which were thought to be produced whenever alcohol was produced and were therefore evidence of post-mortem alcohol production, were sometimes present with ingested alcohol as well. And although researchers had suggested that post-mortem alcohol could not exist above certain concentrations, so that high concentrations were evidence of ingestion, this theory was also disproved.</p> <p>The findings were published in The Journal of Forensic Sciences in July 1993.</p>
486052>United Front on Pollution Dissolved by Squabbling New York thought it had lined up all the states in the Northeast for a coordinated assault on air pollution, but now, amid recriminations, Connecticut may be bailing out. Connecticut officials say New York is trying to railroad all of its neighbors into adopting tough antipollution rules for new cars, already approved in California, that may or may not be cost-effective. Connecticut, New York says, is not pulling its weight in the region&#39;s quest for clean air.  <p>Connecticut&#39;s chief environmental official will not say what advice he will give to Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who may announce as early as today what the state will do. Years of Working Together</p> <p>For years New York and Connecticut have been united in their efforts to reduce the air pollution that blows back and forth across their border, agreeing, for example, with six other states to require the oil companies to make cleaner gasoline. But in the last few days officials have become nasty as they consider adopting the program that California approved last fall, which will eventually require cars that run on alternative fuels or electricity.</p> <p>Connecticut seems to be building a case for delaying taking action on the California standards. If it does, a person who registers a car in Connecticut could buy one for less than the same model would cost in New York because Connecticut would not require extra equipment to meet the California standard. California says the extra equipment would cost less than $200 a car, but auto makers say the cost could be as much as $1,000.</p> <p>Even if all the states adopted the California standards as quickly as they are able, the first new cars to be affected would be the 1996 or 1997 models.</p> <p>New York favors adoption of the California rules as soon as possible, not only by itself, but by all the states in the Northeast, since summer smog tends to drift for hundreds of miles. Last month representatives of 12 states and the District of Columbia met in Philadelphia to discuss adoption of the standards, and Connecticut was the only one to object.</p> <p>In Hartford, the environmental protection commissioner, Timothy R. E. Keeney, talked in a telephone interview on Monday about his counterpart in New York, Thomas C. Jor ling: &quot;Jorling is trying to manipulate the other states into jumping into this thing. We&#39;re going to do it because it makes sense for Connecticut, not for any other reason.</p> <p>&quot;New York jumped on this thing right away without doing any analysis, and wanted everyone to jump on right after them,&quot; he said. &quot;Connecticut was not ready to jump without having done the analysis. Other states were.&quot;</p> <p>In fact, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, the District of Columbia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine signed on. Vermont, which has a far less serious pollution problem, is still considering the matter, as is Rhode Island, where the Governor, Bruce G. Sundlun, has been at his wife&#39;s bedside in Rochester since she was struck by a car last month. Supporters of the stricter standards predict, though, that those two states will follow suit, leaving Connecticut as the lone holdout.  A Push for &#39;Attainment&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Jorling, in a telephone interview, said Connecticut was failing to do its share in the effort to come into compliance with Federal clean air standards, or in air pollution lingo, to &quot;come into attainment.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s extremely difficult for Connecticut not to adopt the standard,&quot; Mr. Jorling said. &quot;Connecticut can&#39;t get attainment unless states like New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey take these steps.&quot; If Connecticut is going to rely on the upwind states to cut their emissions, he said, it must &quot;do something for the downwind states.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I can&#39;t believe Lowell Weicker isn&#39;t going to support this,&quot; Mr. Jorling said.</p> <p>Mr. Keeney said Governor Weicker had already committed the state to using reformulated gasoline, although only the Fairfield County and Hartford metropolitan areas are legally required to do so.</p> <p>The state is also leaning toward requiring gas stations to install special refueling hoses, known as stage 2 hoses, which recapture the fume-laden air that is displaced from gas tanks when they are filled.  Reviewing Options</p> <p>Connecticut is looking at at a wide selection of tools, including more car pooling. But all of these steps are intended to meet a 1996 deadline for reducing the release of two chemical ingredients of smog, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. The California program would not affect vehicles before the model year 1996 or 1997, so its benefits would come later.</p> <p>Connecticut will do its share, Mr. Keeney promised, but it may achieve the reductions by different means. In addition, he pointed out, even if Connecticut does not adopt the California program, which sets stricter and stricter emissions standards with each model year, it will remain subject to the Federal program. That program also calls for some improvements in tailpipe emissions over the years.</p> <p>Mr. Keeney is to present the options to Mr. Weicker this afternoon.</p> <p>While the two states have been cooperating in the last few years, the squabble may reflect a longer-term pattern. In the 1970&#39;s, the shoe was on the other foot, and Connecticut sued the Federal Environmental Protection Agency in an effort to make New York burn cleaner oil in electric generating stations on Long Island. The high-sulfur oil then in use generally caused no pollution in New York, but blew across Long Island Sound into Fairfield and New Haven counties.</p>
1582282>In Big Blackout, Hindsight Is Not 20/20 As the electric grid approaches its season of peak strain, engineers say they still cannot answer the central question of how a power failure in Ohio on Aug. 14, 2003, became the biggest blackout in North American history. Investigators, including officials from the United States and Canada, say that the eastern power grid -- the complex of generators, substations and transmission lines the power failure spread through last August -- has become so large, complicated and heavily loaded in the last two decades that it is difficult to determine how a single problem can expand into an immense failure.  <p>On Wednesday, the North American Electric Reliability Council, an industry group founded after a widespread blackout in the Northeast in 1965, issued an optimistic assessment of the electric grid for the coming summer. &#39;&#39;Generating and transmitting resources are expected to be adequate to meet projected demand for electricity,&#39;&#39; the council said, adding that if all those involved with the grid comply with the council&#39;s reliability standards, &#39;&#39;there should be no uncontrolled blackouts.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A report issued by the Energy Department last month said the blackout began with violations of some of those standards. The report made extensive recommendations for reducing the likelihood of isolated problems -- like the failure of transmission lines in Ohio last August -- but it stopped short of establishing how a local problem cascaded into a catastrophe that spread from northeastern Ohio through Michigan, Ontario and New York and into parts of Connecticut and New Jersey.</p> <p>Investigators did identify how local failures could become larger difficulties in a way that had not been previously known: protective devices called relays could be tricked into shutting down power lines if they sensed short-circuits that did not actually exist. But the report only hinted at solutions.</p> <p>The report has drawn mixed reactions from electricity experts. While some said it was thorough and balanced, others said that it reflected a bias by its overseer, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to de-emphasize ways that deregulation of the electric market might have affected the system&#39;s reliability and vulnerability.</p> <p>One expert pointed to a math error in the report as evidence of that bias. The report asserted that in the 80 percent of the eastern interconnection that remained intact, a speed-up in the frequency of the alternating current, above the usual 60 cycles, indicated a sudden surplus when power stopped flowing into the area that went dark.</p> <p>But the surplus number, which would illustrate how power flows have grown under deregulation, is far too small to match the frequency number given.</p> <p>Robert Blohm, an electricity consultant who first questioned some of the report&#39;s calculations, said in an e-mail message: &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve charged ahead with long-distance markets in electricity without realizing/understanding the reliability effects which this blackout brought home.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>People involved in preparing the report acknowledged that it focused on the origins of the blackout and did not fully explain how it spread. One specialist, Gerry Cauley, the director of standards at the electric reliability council, said it made sense to address promptly the events that started the blackout because they were easily preventable. The events in Ohio were &#39;&#39;so egregious that they just should have never happened,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Alison Silverstein, senior energy policy adviser to the regulatory commission, who drafted much of the report, said in an interview: &#39;&#39;Reliability is about taking care of the basics every single day. That&#39;s what all of those prior blackouts told us. That&#39;s what this blackout told us.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Investigators concluded that power lines initially failed in the blackout because they came into contact with tree branches. The inquiry also found that an Ohio utility and a regional power control agency did not have the computer tools to spot failures as they occurred and make compensating adjustments.</p> <p>Focusing on the origins of last year&#39;s blackout was easier than looking in detail at how it spread, experts said. Mr. Cauley said that lines, substations and generating stations fell in such profusion that plotting just two or three seconds of events takes weeks of work. He says he hopes to finish a detailed analysis by the first anniversary of the blackout.</p> <p>The report discusses several hypotheses about the spread of the disturbance, including relays confusing huge power flows with short-circuits and reacting by shutting lines. Installation of relays that can tell the difference is probably years away, experts said.</p> <p>A broader question is what would have happened if components of the system had been set up to tolerate more disruptions, diluting disturbances.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Maybe the Midwest would not have gone down,&#39;&#39; said Jack Casazza, a transmission expert and consultant. Conversely, he said, had the relays not tripped, it is also possible that the blackout might have spread further. &#39;&#39;Maybe the whole darn East Coast would have gone down. I think it&#39;s important to know the difference.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The report cautions that &#39;&#39;simulation of these events is so complex that it may be impossible to ever completely prove&#39;&#39; theories about the events. Such a thorough analysis was &#39;&#39;not a job we could do in the time we had available,&#39;&#39; said David Meyer, senior adviser to the Office of Electric Transmission and Distribution in the Energy Department.</p> <p>The report notes that some companies on the grid failed to submit complete data and that some utilities, asked to say when and why various components of the electric system shut down, did not fully respond.</p> <p>The report&#39;s focus on initial failures in the blackout contrasts with similar studies of earlier power failures. In 1978, discussing blackouts in 1965 and 1977, the regulatory commission said that it was &#39;&#39;not possible to prevent an occasional localized power failure.&#39;&#39; The trick, the investigators said then, was to prevent local problems from spreading. Ms. Silverstein said that the 1977 blackout was less than a tenth the size of the 2003 blackout, and easier to diagnose.</p>
480937>Eastern Europe&#39;s Reactors Don&#39;t Seem So Distant Now PROTESTERS coined the motto &quot;A nuclear accident anywhere is a nuclear accident everywhere,&quot; but lately it has been adopted by government regulators, looking nervously at the primitive reactors in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Meeting outside Paris last month, top regulators from the seven largest industrialized nations began laying plans for international safety standards. And in Brussels on Thursday, the European Community appropriated $60 million for assistance to the Soviet Union and discussed an aid program begun earlier this year for Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. Significantly, the aid is for improving the regulation of reactors.  <p>&quot;Before this summer, you didn&#39;t see one country tell another country what to do,&quot; said Michael B. Congdon, a foreign policy adviser at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, who recently returned from a tour of reactors in the Soviet Union and the former East Bloc. &quot;The European Community is placing a lot of pressure on Eastern Europe to close these plants,&quot; he said. For years the plants seemed distant, across an iron curtain, but the curtain was only a figure of speech and Western Europe is not very far downwind. The point was driven home Saturday morning with the report of an electrical fire at one of the surviving reactors at Chernobyl. Just as the community sets policy on farm subsidies and food additives, it now wants to set policy on nuclear plants.</p> <p>There is a weak precedent for intervention. In response to the Chernobyl accident, in the Ukraine in 1986, plant owners from around the world met in Moscow in 1989 to form a World Association of Nuclear Operators, with headquarters in London. But that is an advisory group; its organizers took pride in announcing, for example, that by this spring they had arranged for the manager or chief engineer of every nuclear plant in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to visit a Western plant. But the continuing decline of Eastern Europe has emboldened the West to go further. A Delicate Subject</p> <p>In Brussels, where questions of national sovereignty are an old thorn, officials put the issue delicately. &quot;We are providing very significant technical assistance, and we are mandated to use part of this assistance to improve regulatory matters,&quot; said an official of the European Community&#39;s Directorate for the Environment, Nuclear Safety and Civil Protection. The official, who would not be named, said that a &quot;byproduct&quot; of improving the regulation would be to bring the plants up to international norms.</p> <p>But Simon R. Carroll, a nuclear specialist in the Brussels office of Greenpeace, the environmental organization, called the standards a pre-requisite, not a byproduct. &quot;One of the problems is convincing the Bulgarians,&quot; he said. &quot;Because there was no accepted international criteria, it&#39;s been difficult.&quot;</p> <p>Drawing standards is hard, however, because of the great variations in design. The oldest Soviet-built plants lack the concrete-and-steel containment buildings that would hold in radiation in an accident. They were also built without the pipes and pumps that would dump water into the cooling system in case of a leak.</p> <p>American officials point out, however, that the Soviet-built plants have some design strengths. In an accident like the one at Three Mile Island, they would take far longer to overheat, because there is more water in their heat-exchangers. In addition, the cores are large compared with the heat they generate, so overheating would take longer.</p> <p>Recent visitors to Eastern Europe, including Ivan Selin, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, were impressed in many cases that the operators were smart and well trained. But there were telling differences. Their years of experience are useless to them in an accident, he said, because nearly all they know is normal operation; they have no simulators to practice the &quot;crash and burn&quot; scenarios that American operators drill for regularly.</p> <p>And there are short-term problems, like manuals at the Bulgarian plants written in Russian, even though most of the Russians have gone home. Mr. Selin speaks both languages, but he was just visiting.</p> <p>Most of these problems would yield to an American engineering management technique: the continuous, heavy application of money. But that, say Western officials, is at the heart of the problem, because the Eastern European plants don&#39;t generate any money, and are not likely to under democratic regimes, with candidates promising lower prices for necessities.</p> <p>&quot;Unfortunately, every country that owns these plants is in shock,&quot; said Harold R. Denton, director of the N.R.C.&#39;s Office of Governmental and Regulatory Affairs.</p> <p>Getting too closely involved in Eastern Europe is also a hazard. Mr. Denton said that Americans risked &quot;getting co-opted&quot; by making suggestions or paying for safety improvements for a dangerous plant, when the better option would be to close it.</p> <p>The nuclear official at the European Community, asked if his group had recommended closing the Bulgarian complex, replied, &quot;Not officially,&quot; and said some of the community&#39;s aid was being used instead to find alternatives to nuclear generation, given the severe economic impact of a shutdown.</p> <p>Antony P. Froggatt, a Greenpeace organizer in London, mentioned another reason for waffling. Western companies sent in to improve existing reactors are there in large part to gain a foothold in an area that may see new reactor orders, he said. But if they are too harsh in characterizing the existing reactors, said Mr. Froggatt, &quot;people might not want them to build new ones.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s a fine line for them to say, these reactors are dangerous but not too dangerous,&quot; he said.</p> <p>IDEAS &amp; TRENDS</p>
693381>Officials Gird For Walkout On L.I.R.R. Rail, subway and traffic officials yesterday announced their battle plan for a Long Island Rail Road strike that both management and labor say is likely a week from today. And they warned that their most extensive efforts could only begin to address the chaos for commuters. They said they have lined up scores of extra buses and subway trains, crowd-control barricades, park-and-ride lots, tow trucks, extra toll collectors and other accouterments of controlled chaos.  <p>To prevent a strike, President Clinton has already imposed the two cooling-off periods allowed under Federal law. Now it would take action by Congress to block a strike, or an agreement by the two sides, which are to meet again this morning.</p> <p>If a strike does happen, people who normally get to work in 60 or 90 minutes should add an hour to that, officials advised. They said some commuters may line up for buses that never appear, and if enough buses do come, they will take people to subway stations where the police may have to hold people at bay in lines before they reach the turnstiles, to limit overcrowding on the platforms.</p> <p>&quot;We cannot re-create the L.I.R.R.,&quot; said Thomas Prendergast, a senior vice president of the New York City Transit Authority. But Mr. Prendergast has been assigned to try just that, moving 103,000 people into New York in the morning and out at night, and about 3,500 in the opposite direction, without trains.</p> <p>&quot;It will not be a beautiful thing by any definition,&quot; the president of the railroad, Charles Hoppe, warned at a briefing for reporters yesterday. Today the railroad will begin distributing about a million leaflets detailing its arrangements.</p> <p>It&#39;s not unusual for parties to a possible strike to warn of dire effects, and no one can predict with certainty what will happen. But planners do have the precedent of the last strike, in January 1987.</p> <p>On that basis, they project that about 65,000 people will take the subways. According to Michael Primeggia, the city&#39;s deputy commissioner for traffic, in the last strike the number of cars crossing the Queens-Nassau border in either direction jumped by about 19,000 over the usual 845,000, but very few of those went to Manhattan, he said.</p> <p>The city plans various measures, including extra tow trucks. Bus lanes, reversible lanes and the Queensboro Bridge carpool lane will all be in use for longer hours, Mr. Primeggia said.</p> <p>Yesterday the chairman of the United Transportation Union, Edward Yule Jr., was working on plans of his own: he went to Washington to urge important members of Congress not to intervene and stop the walkout. The last strike began on Jan. 18, 1987 and ended 11 days later when Congress ordered the strikers back to work. &#39;Not a National Emergency&#39;</p> <p>The union believes this would again be the railroad&#39;s strategy. But if a strike is called, Mr. Yule said, &quot;it&#39;s local, it&#39;s not a national emergency.&quot; Congress, he said, &quot;should be busy with other things, like health care reform.&quot;</p> <p>Congress acted last time under laws intended to maintain interstate commerce. The union&#39;s ability to strike is regulated by the Railway Labor Act, a 1926 statute. Since the contract expired Jan. 1, 1992, the union and management have gone through direct negotiations, mediation under the National Mediation Board, and two separate emergency boards. Each emergency board triggered a cooling-off period, the second of which is about to expire.</p> <p>Peter E. Stangl, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said yesterday that he had not discussed with Congress any special legislation to stop a strike now. But he said that his authority&#39;s longtime goal had been to have state law, which bars public employees from striking, apply to workers at the L.I.R.R. and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.</p> <p>&quot;The world has changed,&quot; he said. &quot;These are no longer private, profitable railroads operating in interstate commerce. They are local, and the great bulk of the subsidy comes from state and local governments, and we should be under state law.&quot;</p> <p>Subway workers are already under state law.</p> <p>The authority is offering a 3 percent lump-sump payment upon ratification of a contract, and 3 percent each year for 1993, 1994 and 1995. The union seeks a 4 percent increase from the time the old contract expired, 4 percent for 1993 and 1994, and 5 percent for 1995. Other differences concern benefits and work rules. Some union members, for example, now collect overtime for working on Saturday or Sunday; the railroad wants to schedule them for weekend work and give them weekdays off in exchange.</p> <p>The railroad, part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has already trimmed about 400 jobs covered by the union in the last four years, and wants more cuts, according to Mr. Yule.  Limiting Pay Increases</p> <p>The chief negotiator for the M.T.A., the L.I.R.R.&#39;s parent agency, said the authority was determined to limit wage increases. The negotiator, Gary Dellaverson, said that with the increases the authority has offered, the L.I.R.R. workers would be paid more than any other passenger railroad workers. And, he said, they are paid more than those at other M.T.A. units, including the Transit Authority and Metro-North.</p> <p>The Transit Authority contract expires at the end of this month, and the Metro-North contract expired months ago. The L.I.R.R. contract is a pace-setter for both.</p> <p>If a strike comes now, Long Islanders would at least be spared the complications of winter; in the last one there were two snowstorms. But officials said planning was harder right now because the World Cup soccer competition and the Gay Games are competing for buses.</p> <p>To compensate, the plan calls for buses from various locations in Nassau and Suffolk to deliver commuters to subway stations in eastern Queens instead of to Manhattan, as was attempted in the 1987 strike. Buses covering a shorter route should be able to make two trips in each rush hour, planners hope. In the last strike, the buses made one trip each, and some got caught in inbound traffic in the afternoon and failed to arrive to pick up people finishing work and bound for home.</p> <p>And the police will control the number of people entering subway stations. Last time, said Mr. Prendergast, so many people tried to crowd onto the trains that instead of spending 30 to 45 seconds in the station, they were stuck for four to five minutes. Service ground to a halt.</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s very difficult to tell somebody, &#39;Stand back and wait for the next train,&#39; if they have on their mind this is the last train,&quot; he said. So this time police and station personnel will admit only a certain number of people a minute, 100 to 175, depending on the station. The Transit Authority has sometimes slowed access at the turnstiles at major events like concerts, he said, but had never actually counted heads before.</p> <p>Some stations will see a 25 percent surge in traffic, he said. The Transit Authority will add some trains from those stations and some from intermediate points, to serve regular customers who will be displaced by railroad commuters, he said.</p> <p>In addition, charter buses will run to the subways from the Fortunoff Backyard Store parking lot, the Bay Shore at South Shore Mall, and the L.I.R.R. stations at Merrick, Manhasset, Amityville, Babylon, Copiague, Deer Park, Huntington, Lindenhurst and Ronkonkoma, but there may not be enough to meet demand. So bus operators will not sell tickets until it is clear that buses are available, Mr. Prendergast said.</p> <p>[ A fuller description of extra bus service will appear in the Long Island Weekly section on Sunday. ]</p>
542100>COMPANY NEWS: Odorization Pros Convene; It&#39;s Not Just the Politicians Who Sit in Conventions Just about everybody has a convention. This summer, after the Democrats in New York and the Republicans in Houston, it will be the odorization experts, in Chicago. According to the organizers, the Institute of Gas Technology, the meeting &quot;provides the opportunity to dip into the largest pool of odorization talent that ever assembles in one place to get your odorization questions and problems answered and solved.&quot;  <p>Because natural gas has no odor, it is spiked, usually with ethyl mercaptan, so that the human nose can detect gas leaks. An ethyl mercaptan spill in Montebello, Calif., in 1981 made thousands of people sick and dizzy.</p> <p>The agenda for the two-and-a-half-day meeting includes a session called &quot;Use of Electronic Controls for, and Operation and Maintenance of, Large Volume Odorizer Installations,&quot; followed by a panel discussion of &quot;What&#39;s New in Odorizer Equipment.&quot; Another lecture is on &quot;Odorant Loss in Natural Gas Distribution,&quot; a problem in pipelines coated with rust, followed by the &quot;Odor Fading Panel.&quot;</p> <p>Gerald G. Wilson, director of industrial education at the Institute for Gas Technology, said about 150 people would attend.</p> <p>At first, the conferences were held six years apart, then four, then three, and now, for the first time, two years apart. &quot;People kept telling us, &#39;You ought to do it more often,&#39; &quot; Mr. Wilson said. This year, the conference topic will be broader, covering odorization of liquid propane gas, he said.</p> <p>Of course, there is a session on the legal aspects of odorization, including product liablity questions. Two of the speakers are &quot;top expert witnesses on odorization,&quot; according to the institute.</p> <p>Mr. Wilson cautioned that the symposium is &quot;not primarily a short course for beginners; it is aimed mostly at practitioners.&quot;</p>
832072>Last Crash Is Fourth This Month The crash that killed 11 people here on Friday night was the fourth major train accident so far this month, but Federal officials said today that the accidents appeared to have no common thread. &quot;We haven&#39;t found any common denominator,&quot; said John Goglia, a member of the  National Transportation Safety Board, although he stressed that the investigation was just getting under way.  <p>Investigators from the safety board still do not know the cause of the accident. Without testimony from the commuter train&#39;s three-person crew, who apparently were all killed in the accident, the investigators have to rely on data from computers plus an examination of mechanical parts like brakes and rails. They are looking at several possibilities: that a signal might have failed, a crew member might have failed to notice a signal, or brakes might have malfunctioned. They also want to determine if a derailment preceded the crash.</p> <p>The National Transportation Safety Board is leading a team of 75 experts investigating the crash. Technicians and engineers are analyzing the &quot;event recorders&quot; aboard each train, which will give them information like the speed, throttle position, brake position and condition of the drive motors of each train. Working with that data, they will be able to determine, for example, if either train skidded on the snowy tracks.</p> <p>The investigators are also analyzing the records from the computerized signal systems beside the track. That data should show what color each signal was at a given time, and that information can be integrated with the data from the trains.</p> <p>There are, however, new computer-based technologies that could make certain kinds of railroad accidents nearly impossible, even as the rails become increasingly crowded. Traffic is getting heavier because freight and passenger trains are sharing a smaller track network.</p> <p>Technology already in use on some lines -- but not the one where this crash occurred -- stop trains automatically if they run red signals. New computer systems, communicating by digital radio, can track trains&#39; positions precisely with signals from satellites orbiting Earth, allowing them to run closer together. The knowledge of the trains&#39; precise location allows them to be safe even though they are closer to each other.  Technology can also set different speed limits for each train, based on each one&#39;s braking power.</p> <p>The Secretary of Transportation, Federico F. Pena, said in a telephone interview tonight that he had ordered the Federal Railroad Administration and the Federal Transit Administration, which are both part of his department, to review the operating procedures and the use of technology for railroads around the country.</p> <p>&quot;One of the questions being asked is the extent of use of technology,&quot; Mr. Pena said. &quot;The Long Island Rail Road and others have technologies that essentially prevent a train from passing a signal improperly. This train did not have it.&quot;</p> <p>But he added that such systems were effective only if all trains had them. On lines that mix passenger and freight traffic, many trains would have to be equipped at considerable expense.</p> <p>Mr. Pena said officials would also review the Federal limits on how many hours an engineer can work, which might have been a factor in a crash last week  involving New Jersey Transit trains, and would also review the technology that dispatchers use to communicate with train crews. The Transportation Department is helping to finance experiments involving computer communications with moving  trains.</p> <p>Four rail accidents have occurred this month. In addition to Friday&#39;s collision, the two New Jersey Transit commuter trains collided on Feb. 9, killing two crew members and one passenger. On Feb. 15, a runaway freight train  slammed into a railroad office building in East St. Paul, Minn., injuring nine people, and on Feb. 1, a freight train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed near Devore, Calif., and erupted into flames, killing two crew members.</p> <p>Officials insist, though, that train travel is, on average, much safer than most other transportation modes. Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland, speaking at the briefing today, said, &quot;We should not infer that there is some type of huge problem with train travel.&quot;</p> <p>In fact, the National Safety Council said in a report released late last year that from 1983 to 1993, the death rate on trains ran was 0.18 deaths per 100 million passenger miles, about 80 percent lower than the rate for travel by cars and taxis. The rate was still substantially higher than the rate for airplanes,  however, which was less than 0.1 deaths per 100 million passenger miles.</p> <p>But the death rate for train travel could be lower. In a report to Congress in July 1994, the Federal Railroad Administration said that in a 68-month period beginning in 1988, there had been 116 accidents that technology could have been  prevented.</p>
825621>50 Billion Might As Well Be Infinity SUDDENLY infinity got a whole lot bigger. Last week astronomers said they had analyzed a sliver of sky and concluded that the universe has 50 billion galaxies, up from the 10 billion galaxies of the last estimate. With perhaps 50 to 100 billion stars per galaxy, the number of stars in the universe could be 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Fifty billion isn&#39;t infinity, of course; only infinity is infinity. But since we&#39;ve counted 50 billion of something and found it too formidable to think about, infinity seems  all that much more remote.  <p>So let&#39;s attempt to make 50 billion cozy and manageable.</p> <p>If captains Kirk, Picard, Cisco and Janeway each encounter one new galaxy per episode -- say, the Crab Nebula in Taurus on an ordinary weekday show, and the Milky Way during sweeps week -- and there&#39;s a new episode each day, then the &quot;Star Trek&quot; crew could cover the universe in a mere 34 million years. That assumes no reruns.</p> <p>Here&#39;s another way to look 50 billion galaxies in the eye. A traveler who spends one second on each galaxy, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, would go through them all in 1,585 years, five months, 28 days, 16 hours and about 37 minutes -- not counting leap seconds.</p> <p>Or try this. Until last week, there were about two galaxies for every person  on earth. Now there are 10 per person.</p> <p>The Bible&#39;s Trouble With Numbers</p> <p>People have had trouble with big numbers for a long time. Even the Bible, which has more than a passing acquaintance with infinity, seems to stumble over  them.</p> <p>The King James version of Genesis, for example, records that God promised Abraham (in chapter 13, line 16) that He would make Abraham&#39;s descendants &quot;as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.&quot; But only two chapters later (in chapter 15, line 5), the offer was rephrased, when God told Abraham, &quot;Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them.&quot; He then said, &quot;so shall thy seed be.&quot;</p> <p>Those are obviously two very different numbers; without a telescope, Abraham  could have seen only a few thousand visible stars, while the particles of dust would have been, well, innumerable. But maybe God was just having trouble expressing Himself. The Hebrew of Genesis, after all, has no separate system of  numerals; the ancient Hebrews, like the Romans used alphabetic characters to represent numbers. So, the biblical God was blissfully free of exponential differences. Where Gazillion Begins</p> <p>The Egyptians, who dealt with numbers in the millions, and the Babylonians,  who counted even further, could never have gotten away with that kind of stuff.  Archimedes once even estimated the number of grains of sand necessary to fill the universe at 1 with 51 zeroes after it, according to David Joyce, a historian of mathematics at Clark University.</p> <p>Ordinary Americans don&#39;t do infinitely better than the Hebrews or Romans did. After trillions, numbers with 12 zeroes, used mostly to measure the national debt, most people lapse into gazillions, which is, not to be overly precise, a number with a lot of zeroes after it.</p> <p>But people can develop a visceral feel for numbers if they use them long enough, according to John Allen Paulos, a professor of Mathematics at Temple University and the author of &quot;Innumeracy.&quot; &quot;When you talk about the budget, the  G.N.P.,&quot; he said, &quot;it&#39;s not hard after a while to divide the population of the United States into a number like $4 trillion,&quot; to calculate your share of the debt. And astronomers, almost by definition, are people who have learned to deal with astronomical numbers, to see a difference between 10 billion and 50 billion.</p> <p>Though most people aren&#39;t comfortable with lots of zeroes, they are often fascinated by them. How many trees are in the Hundred Acre Wood? How many islands in the Thousand Islands? How many candidates are there in the Republican primary in New Hampshire? How many home pages are there on the World Wide Web? How many holes does it take to fill the Albert Hall?</p> <p>Pick a number, any number.</p> <p>JANUARY 14-20  Correction:  February 4, 1996, Sunday</p> <p>An article on Jan. 21 about how people grapple with unimaginably large numbers referred incorrectly to the Crab Nebula in Taurus. It is a remnant left  by the explosion of a giant star; it is not a galaxy.</p>
1638603>&#39;Magic&#39; Fuel-Saving Buses Fall a Bit Short on Wonders The fleet of hybrid buses that General Motors promised would save Seattle more than 750,000 gallons of fuel a year will actually save less than half that amount, according to the fleet operator, and although G.M. said the hybrid buses would show a fuel economy improvement of up to 60 percent, the savings around the country appear to be in the range of 10 percent to 20 percent, transit managers say. General Motors, which got a late start bringing hybrid technology to market in cars, has argued that buses are a better vehicle to convert to hybrid drive, because they are used more heavily than cars.  <p>&#39;&#39;We decided we would go after hybrids by going after the highest consuming vehicles first&#39;&#39; because that would save the most petroleum, said Tom Stephens, a G.M. vice president for powertrains.</p> <p>The company is also creating hybrid versions of its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, although their hybrid systems are relatively small adjuncts to the gasoline engines.</p> <p>But the fuel savings for G.M.&#39;s bus hybrids, which it named &#39;&#39;magic buses,&#39;&#39; are more modest than for some bus hybrids already in use, and even at the current elevated price for diesel fuel the savings are unlikely to repay the cost premium for a hybrid, about $200,000, experts say. There are other benefits, however, including lower maintenance costs and smoother, cleaner operation.</p> <p>All hybrids are powered by both an internal-combustion engine and an electric motor, but G.M. chose a &#39;&#39;parallel&#39;&#39; approach, in which the engine and the electric motor turn the wheels simultaneously, a technology more suited for freely flowing traffic. Some bus agencies report greater fuel savings using a &#39;&#39;series&#39;&#39; hybrid, in which the engine is connected only to an electric generator, with all the power to the wheels coming from an electric motor.</p> <p>Some of the best results for hybrid buses have been for series hybrids running in extremely congested cities. New York City, for example, has more than 100 series hybrids on the streets and next month will begin receiving the first of an additional 200 buses with a hybrid drivetrain built by BAE Systems of Johnson City, N.Y., with a fuel savings of 35 percent to 45 percent, according to transit officials.</p> <p>Electric motors excel at getting a heavy bus moving from a standing start, and when it is time to stop again -- which in New York is often only a few yards later -- the hybrid system recaptures a lot of that energy by converting the momentum of the bus into electric current, which flows back into the batteries. The batteries are also directly charged by the diesel engine.</p> <p>But the series system is not well suited to buses in highway use, experts say, because converting the energy from the diesel engine into electricity, and then putting the electric current through a motor to turn the wheels, is not as efficient as simply connecting the diesel engine to the wheels through a conventional transmission. In the parallel system, the bus wheels are driven by both a conventional transmission and an electric motor. Either type can reduce air pollution, by cutting the amount of time that the diesel engine operates at very high strain and low revolutions per minute. As is obvious to any urban pedestrian, that is when diesels give off great clouds of dark smoke. With an electric motor to assist or take over at start-up, though, the diesel engine can run at a higher speed and lower strain, a range in which it is cleaner.</p> <p>The buses in Seattle, which ordered 235 hybrids, were chosen mostly for cleanliness, said Jim Boon, the maintenance manager at King County Metro Transit. The buses go through a tunnel under the downtown section, a little more than a mile long, which has limited ventilation.</p> <p>&quot;We&#39;re quite happy, actually,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Boon. &quot;We did not buy these for fuel economy.&quot; According to G.M., both the company and the King County transit authority concluded from early tests that a fuel savings near 60 percent was possible.</p> <p>Connecticut Transit, a state bus agency, is running two 40-foot buses with the G.M. hybrid transmission. They started in Hartford and have been running in Stamford since June. Stephen W. Warren, the assistant general manager for maintenance, said that drivers and customers liked them because they were smooth and fast. But, he added, &#39;&#39;We were slightly disappointed with the fuel economy,&#39;&#39; which he said was 10 percent to 15 percent better than new buses of conventional design.</p> <p>New Jersey Transit runs seven of the buses. The agency bought them believing they would save 20 percent to 40 percent on fuel, and the actual savings have been at the bottom of that range, said Penny Bassett Hackett, a spokeswoman. New Jersey paid $600,000 to $800,000 extra for each of its buses, and had no possibility of earning that back, she said, but paid for the extra cost with a grant meant to stimulate new technologies. &#39;&#39;The buses are achieving what they are intended to do, and that is emissions reduction,&#39;&#39; Ms. Bassett Hackett said.</p> <p>At the American Public Transit Association, an association of transit agencies based in Washington, Lurae Stuart, senior project manager of Bus Technical Programs, said: &#39;&#39;We don&#39;t define &#39;good&#39; as fuel economy. We define good as the combination of emissions, brake savings and acceleration, which saves time and scheduling.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Still, many experts expected the hybrid to do better, and they disagree about why it does not. Mr. Boon, of Seattle, said that at the time his agency switched buses, it also switched to new engines, which comply with a 2004 Environmental Protection Agency standard for reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides and soot, and that the new engines were less fuel-efficient than the old ones. In fact, he said, an old engine would make the hybrid nearly 60 percent more fuel efficient.</p> <p>But Caterpillar, the company that makes the engine used in the Seattle buses, said that while some competitors&#39; engines that met the new standard were about 5 percent less fuel efficient, its engine used a different approach, which it has patented, that unlike the others did not reduce fuel economy.</p> <p>An E.P.A. spokesman, John Millett, said his agency certified the engines only for emissions, not fuel economy, and did not know what effect, if any, its requirements had had on mileage. A more stringent set of emission rules takes effect in 2007.</p> <p>At General Motors, Larry Nitz, director of hybrid powertrain engineering, said the 60 percent estimate was based on a treadmill-type test, and the 750,000 gallon estimate was a separate calculation based on side-by-side tests using a hybrid and a conventional transmission, and older engines. &#39;&#39;I think we&#39;re doing what we expected to do in Seattle,&#39;&#39; Mr. Nitz said in a telephone interview.</p> <p>Others say that the technology has promise for several reasons, and that fuel economy could improve as the vehicles are tweaked, with better software controlling the hybrid powertrain.</p> <p>In the Philadelphia area, the Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority is operating 32 G.M. hybrid buses but is not tracking their fuel economy, which would require precise comparison with conventional buses running on exactly the same routes.</p> <p>But Patrick Nowakowski, the assistant general manager of operations, gave an indication of how well the buses were performing. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re not getting worse mileage,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;but if somebody&#39;s justifying the cost differential based on fuel savings, it&#39;s a stretch.&#39;&#39;</p>
1852056>Board Blames F.A.A. and Airline for Crash Long before a wing fell off a 58-year-old seaplane in Miami, causing a crash that killed all 20 people on board, the Federal Aviation Administration should have known that the airline was failing to inspect and maintain its antique fleet, other federal safety officials said Wednesday. In an unusually pointed criticism of the agency, the National Transportation Safety Board ranked regulatory failure as an equal cause of the crash along with the failure of the airline, Chalk&#39;s Ocean Airways of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to repair cracks properly. The plane went down on Dec. 19, 2005.  <p>&#39;&#39;It glares at you that this was a poorly operated airline,&#39;&#39; said the chairman of the safety board, Mark V. Rosenker.</p> <p>But a lawyer for the airline, which flew seaplanes between Florida and the Bahamas, said it had followed all the rules. After the crash, Chalk&#39;s certificate to operate a scheduled airline was suspended, but the company is still flying, by leasing conventional planes and crews from another operator.</p> <p>Mr. Rosenker noted that Congress enacted a law in 1991 requiring tighter standards for old planes after the roof peeled off a Boeing 737 in 1988, but that the F.A.A. rules do not go fully into effect until 2010.</p> <p>And in fact, the rules as adopted do not cover planes approved by the government before 1958, thus exempting the plane that crashed in Miami, a 1940s design Grumman Mallard.</p> <p>But there were numerous warning signs about Chalk&#39;s Ocean Airways, safety board members said, with several citing a letter sent in January 2005 by a captain who quit over safety issues.</p> <p>The wreckage showed that the plane crashed because a crack in the wing&#39;s skin had been ineffectively repaired, probably more than once, investigators said. An inspection in March 2005 should have identified the problem but did not, they said.</p> <p>The board said metallurgical evidence pointed to the repair as having been done by the airline. But a lawyer representing Chalk&#39;s, Dennis M. O&#39;Hara, said the repair was probably made before Chalk&#39;s bought the plane, which was in 1999 or 2000.</p> <p>There was no F.A.A. rule for how to inspect that part of the wing, Mr. O&#39;Hara said. &#39;&#39;We followed the rules with regard to the maintenance process in place,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The airline had heavy turnover in personnel and was losing money, said Deborah A. P. Hersman, one of the board members, and the pilot who was the safety director did not have time for her safety duties.</p> <p>The safety board&#39;s managing director, Joe Osterman, said that the F.A.A. official in charge of overseeing maintenance &#39;&#39;had sufficient cues to identify a problem, and didn&#39;t do anything about it.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A spokesman for the aviation agency, Les Dorr, said it &#39;&#39;did not have any indication that Chalk&#39;s maintenance program was inadequate.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;In fact,&#39;&#39; Mr. Dorr said, &#39;&#39;it served them very well for many, many years.&#39;&#39;</p>
434232>Steinway Changing Amid Tradition Steinway occupies a unique place in the world of music, a near-monopoly both on the concert stage and in the public image of quality. There is a sense that the 12,000 parts of a Steinway grand piano, held together with solid brass fittings and 26 types of glue, is a work of art. But in Steinway&#39;s factory in Astoria, Queens, where workers use 100-year-old equipment and methods that date back even farther to turn out 2,500 instruments a year, managers are wrestling with a difficult transition to modern manufacturing.  <p>Steinway&#39;s mystique and pre-eminence are such that when the company makes changes, the piano community takes it as another sign of the decline of Western civilization. And Steinway &amp; Sons, which holds 130 patents in piano making and claims to have invented the modern piano, has made some notable changes of late.</p> <p>Two months ago it named a new general manager at the factory, one markedly different from his predecessors who had grown up in the Steinway culture. The company tapped Sanford G. Woodard, a 48-year-old Annapolis graduate with a Harvard M.B.A., who was trained as a quality control engineer in the nuclear industry.</p> <p>Mr. Woodard had previously worked as a manager of strategic planning and development at the General Electric Company, and as general manager of Asea Brown Boveri&#39;s induction furnace division. He has previous experience in a keyboard instrument, he said almost bashfully -- on the accordion. He began taking piano lessons shortly before he took the job in January.</p> <p>Then, this month, Steinway announced that it would design a line of &quot;midpriced&quot; pianos to be built by Kawai, the Japanese manufacturer, and sold by Steinway dealers. For a company dedicated to the top end of the market -- its average sale is for $30,000 and the most expensive model is more than twice that -- this was also a substantial departure.</p> <p>Steinway was quick to minimize the changes. Mr. Woodard noted, for example, that the new line would not be sold as a Steinway. The fear among Steinway devotees, however, is that the grand old lady of piano making could go the way of some lesser competitors, selling &quot;stencil pianos,&quot; generic instruments built by one manufacturer but sold by a better-known company that simply stencils its name on the front.</p> <p>The company says its pianos, which it once advertised as &quot;the instrument of the immortals,&quot; are as good as ever, and even better, because Steinway has been an innovator. Certainly, the company enjoys market success; sales and prices are up. But others say that not as much care goes into making the piano these days.  Facing Pressures</p> <p>The company does not portray itself as responding to pressures, but there is little question that pressures exist. Among them are changes in two of the main ingredients of pianos: labor and materials.</p> <p>Skilled labor is harder to find, and so is high-quality wood. Elephant and walrus bone for keys are unobtainable. The lacquer formula Steinway used for decades was banned in the 1980&#39;s, and had to be reformulated, because it caused air pollution.</p> <p>All of these changes in the two main ingredients have helped prompt some rethinking of the third ingredient, design. But in recent years, Steinway&#39;s record in making changes of any sort has encountered problems.</p> <p>In the 1960&#39;s, for example, it tried substituting Teflon for felt inbushings in the piano actions, the part that links the keys to the hammers, because it was more durable and amenable to extremely precise adjustment. But piano technicians complained bitterly about it and customers said it caused a clicking noise. The company eventually backed off. &#39;Living Off Their Name&#39;</p> <p>More recently, Steinway has partly mechanized the business of fitting the soundboard to the frame. One result is a tighter fit. Outsiders note that Steinway has had a problem with cracked soundboards, and say the mechanization is at fault. Steinway denies it has a problem.</p> <p>Technicians also complain that Steinway now puts less time into finishing its pianos. &quot;They ship this stuff out and expect people, because of their name, to accept it,&quot; said Fred Hitchcock, whose company, the Hitchcock Piano Company, rebuilds pianos, and who is the piano technician for the American School of Ballet and the New York City Ballet. &quot;They&#39;re living off their name,&quot; Mr. Hitchcock said.</p> <p>He said he had been asked by clients to evaluate pianos at Steinway Hall, the company&#39;s 57th Street showroom, found flaws, was promised they would be corrected and found they were not.</p> <p>The efforts to cope with change have not happened in a competitive vacuum. There have always been other piano makers, like Bosendorfer and Bechstein, but they have had little success in breaking into Steinway&#39;s top-of-the-line niche. In recent years, Japanese competitors, like Yamaha, have come along with more modern plants and lower labor costs, and which turn out 50 times as many pianos as Steinway each year.  The Toughest Competitor</p> <p>But Steinway has a more formidable competitor at its back, a competitor well established in the marketplace and well loved by the public: the Steinways built decades ago.</p> <p>&quot;An old Steinway that&#39;s been reconditioned is a gem,&quot; said Tamera Slobodkin as she finished a recent three-hour, 2.5-mile tour of the Steinway factory in Astoria with the Suffolk Piano Teachers Forum. Others in the group nodded in assent.</p> <p>Indeed, the public sense, right or wrong, is that they don&#39;t build &#39;em like they used to. This sense, augmented by a rocky change in ownership in 1982, has put sharp limits on the changes they can make now. The piano bearing serial number 517,000, recently finished at the factory, may be in competition with one with a number around 340,000, built in 1953, or around 260,000, built in 1928, or even 80,000, built in 1894.</p> <p>&quot;I would much prefer an old Steinway that has been properly restored, to a brand new one,&quot; said William E. Garlick, a former national field service manager for Steinway who is now a leading educator of piano technicians, once called tuners.</p> <p>Mr. Garlick quickly added that his preference, based on the old wood, workmanship and design, was a personal preference. But among Steinway&#39;s most important customer group, the serious pianists, piano technicians and piano teachers the big question is whether the new Steinways are as good as the old ones. And this worry has cast a shadow over every technical innovation that the company tries to make. Piano traditionalists look at changes to the Steinway the way a theologian might look at rewriting the Bible.</p> <p>Mr. Woodard, however, said that the piano produced today is the best ever, and that views to the contrary are part of the &quot;rosy glow of history.&quot; He said, &quot;I&#39;ve seen documentation of people complaining that the 1870 Steinway isn&#39;t the equal of the 1860 Steinway,&quot; he said.</p> <p>In the small world of piano professionals, Steinway&#39;s reputation took a plunge during a 13-year bout with corporate ownership that began in 1972, when CBS bought the company from the last oners named Steinway.</p> <p>Lloyd W. Meyer, who took over the company for CBS in 1982, said Steinway&#39;s problems really originated in the final years under the family, when ownership was spread among 80 or 90 people and there was no money to replace worn equipment.  Large Paley Investment</p> <p>The then-chairman of CBS, William Paley, &quot;came in with millions of dollars, and treated it like an art object,&quot; Mr. Meyer said. &quot;He put in money and machinery.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;But then outside managers came in and said, we&#39;ve put in all this money; let&#39;s get some of it back,&quot; Mr. Meyer said. &quot;They tried to speed up the process.&quot;</p> <p>In 1985, CBS sold Steinway to Robert and Jack Birmingham, two brothers from Boston whose family money came from a fuel-oil business. Mr. Meyer now heads a competing company, Mason &amp; Hamlin.</p> <p>The Birminghams brought in engineers from outside the piano business, engendering suspicion among piano technicians. Mr. Meyer said, &quot;I don&#39;t think these guys wanted to screw it up, but they know nothing about the piano business, and there are ways to go wrong.&quot;  Changes Start a Debate</p> <p>Traditionalists cite two cautionary examples of going wrong with new technology. The company denies that either was an error, and an intense debate rages.</p> <p>Mr. Meyer said that Steinway was turning out pianos with less labor in them. In the early 1980&#39;s, he said, Steinway built fewer than 2,000 a year in Astoria, using more than 400 craftsmen. Last year it made about 2,500, with just 370 craftsmen. But Mr. Woodard said the labor needed had hardly changed at all.</p> <p>The company says that while sales last year were below the level of the heyday of pianos early in this century, they were still the highest in the last half-century.</p> <p>Steinway&#39;s strong sales come at a weak time for the piano business, which probably shipped only about 125,000 pianos last year, according to Donald W. Dillon, executive director of the Piano Manufacturers Association International of Dallas. That is down from 240,000 pianos in 1978, a peak year, he said. A Small Share</p> <p>Steinway&#39;s share has remained at a level near statistical insignificance, but it has continued to dominate the market important to it, the concert stage and the larger grands. It also sells uprights.</p> <p>And Steinway&#39;s prices are extremely strong, up about 50 percent in the last five years. The company&#39;s most popular piano, the nine-foot Model B grand, sells for $37,200 in the least expensive finish, ebony. The price range for grands is $21,900 to $62,800; the least expensive Steinway is an upright, which sells for $9,960.</p> <p>A few pianos produced in small volumes by other companies sell for more, but Steinway is mostly in a class by itself. A saying in the business is that a buyer is either shopping for a piano or for a Steinway.</p> <p>For the time being, Steinway is praising all the oddities that make it so different, most prominently that no two Steinways are alike. This is true in terms of the subtle characteristics of the piano, like the feel of the action or the character of the sound, but at Steinway it is true even of the body of the piano itself.</p> <p>But not everyone agrees that this degree of individuality is a virtue. &quot;Some of the talk about individuality is a cover-up for workmanship that&#39;s not as precise as it should be,&quot; said Larry Fine, the author of &quot;The Piano Book,&quot; a consumer guide to buying a new or used piano. &quot;In those particular cases,&quot; he said, &quot;increasing computerization and engineers standardizing things is going to help.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;There are some things at Steinway that could benefit from modern technology, and a dispassionate look from someone who has not been in the field,&quot; he added, referring to Mr. Woodard and other new managers.</p>
1361007>Optimism on Meeting a Baggage Deadline Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said today that the administration would meet a Friday deadline for improved security for checked baggage. But one of his deputies said the new system could cause problems as airlines put into place the  process of matching bags with passengers. Speaking of the potential for disruption, the senior transportation department official, who spoke on condition that he not be more specifically identified, said: &#39;&#39;There will be places where it works better than others. We&#39;ll just have to see how the new security is deployed, but we&#39;re hopeful it will be deployed efficiently and effectively.&#39;&#39;  <p>He said he did not know which places would be most likely to have problems.</p> <p>To meet the Friday deadline set by the aviation security law enacted 60 days ago, airlines will rely heavily on what they call &#39;&#39;bag matching,&#39;&#39; which is meant to assure that no bag is loaded onto a plane unless the owner is aboard. But for now, the matching is limited to the beginning of trips, so that if a passenger is booked to change planes, the passenger could skip the second leg and the bag could go on alone. The decision to limit matching to the beginning of a trip was a concession to the airlines, which feared that their flight hubs could grind to a halt.</p> <p>At the Air Transport Association, the trade group of the big airlines, Michael Wascom, a spokesman, said that &#39;&#39;we&#39;re hopeful and even cautiously optimistic&#39;&#39; about avoiding widespread delays.</p> <p>But some people in the industry were not satisfied. Pat Friend, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants, referred to bombing of the Pan Am jet en route from London to New York that exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;That was a bag loaded on a connection from Frankfurt,&#39;&#39; Ms. Friend pointed out.</p> <p>The new law requires that some bags be put through the explosive detection machines, some be searched by hand and some sniffed by dogs. But each method, besides bag matching, can handle only a small portion of the one billion bags checked annually.</p> <p>Mr. Mineta and other officials stressed that the deadline on Friday  was merely a milestone and that more important milestones lay ahead, notably one that will require that by Dec. 31, each bag will have to be scanned by a machine that detects explosives.</p> <p>Soon after the law was enacted, Mr. Mineta publicly expressed skepticism that the Friday deadline could be met.</p> <p>The airports will require about 2,000 explosive screening machines. The government has not yet placed a major order, because some machines cost more than $1 million each and it is seeking to cut costs.</p> <p>Mr. Mineta also said the airlines had finished hardening their cockpit doors.</p> <p>In a speech to the Transportation Research Board, he also said that beginning immediately, federal officials would begin work at Baltimore-Washington International Airport to analyze security procedures and test aspects of the federal takeover of security screening that must be accomplished there and at 428 other airports by the end of the year. The airport was chosen partly because of its proximity to Washington, officials said.</p> <p>A NATION CHALLENGED: AIRPORT SECURITY</p>
374412>The Iraqi Invasion;   70&#39;s-Style Price Shock Not Likely in This Oil War A new round of economic warfare seemed to be under way yesterday, as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait resurrected both higher oil prices and fears of OPEC domination of the world oil market. But many ground rules have changed, both for nations that export oil and for those that import it.  <p>The price surges on the spot oil market yesterday recalled the shocks of the 70&#39;s and stirred concerns about slower growth and more inflation worldwide. But unless pure fear inflates demand unnecessarily, the world is probably not headed for price run-ups on the scale of the 1979 oil shock, when prices tripled within months.</p> <p>For now, the world is sitting on a near-record stockpile of crude, and at least some surplus capacity exists inside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p> <p>But in the years since the oil shocks of 1974 and 1979, OPEC members, including Kuwait and Iraq, have taken far different approaches to economic development, introducing strains into the organization.</p> <p>Uncertainty at the Pump</p> <p>The effect at the gasoline pump is uncertain. Crude oil prices fell sharply in the early part of this year but gasoline prices were stable. In the longer term, an increase of $7 a barrel in crude, which is what the markets have seen in recent weeks, would come to 17 cents a gallon at the pump.</p> <p>In contrast to 1974 and 1979, experts point out, it is not clear that Iraq intends any interruption in output.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Loadings were stopped; that&#39;s all we know,&#39;&#39; said Wolfgang G. Luding, head of the oil industry division of the International Energy Agency in Paris. &#39;&#39;They may resume tomorrow.&#39;&#39; Even if they do not, though, and Kuwait does not load a single tanker this month, world inventory on Sept. 1 would be about the same as it was last Sept. 1, according to Joseph Stanislaw, of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.</p> <p>Confirming the surplus, the Exxon Corporation estimated yesterday that the world inventory is 150 million to 200 million barrels &#39;&#39;in excess of normal commercial needs,&#39;&#39; about 100 to 133 days worth of Kuwaiti production of 1.5 million barrels daily.</p> <p>Other Sources of Oil</p> <p>Even if Kuwait&#39;s production were lost for a longer period, there are other sources. Outside the Persian Gulf, Venezuela has about one million barrels a day of spare capacity, experts say, and other countries could produce an additional one million barrels a day.</p> <p>On the Gulf, Saudi Arabia alone has two million barrels a day or more of idle capacity, and the United Arab Emirates has about 800,000, Mr. Stanislaw said. But having seen Kuwait invaded by a neighbor bent on enforcing quotas, they may be reluctant to produce much more.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They&#39;ve now got a lot of Iraqi tanks a lot closer than they were yesterday,&#39;&#39; said Michael C. Lynch, a political scientist and energy analyst with the Washington International Energy Group, a consulting firm.</p> <p>Still, Mr. Stanislaw said, there is no immediate reason to believe that Iraq would hobble Kuwaiti production. If Saddam Hussein now effectively owns Kuwait or exacts a tribute from it, he may prefer even higher production.</p> <p>Impulse of the Marketplace</p> <p>But this logic may never prevail in the marketplace, say some analysts, who point out that the impulse in time of shortage is to buy more, even if huge stocks are on hand. And the price of oil depends on the price of the last barrel purchased. At the Institute for International Economics, Philip K. Verleger, a visiting fellow, estimated that a 10 percent shortfall in world supply would raise prices to about $45 a barrel.</p> <p>A price that high, however, would bring new supplies to market. In contrast, in 1979, when the fall of the Shah of Iran removed that country&#39;s six million barrels a day from world markets, capacity elsewhere was thin. The same was true at the time of the Arab oil embargo of 1974. And after both interruptions, demand from nervous consumers swelled far above normal.</p> <p>In trading yesterday of contracts for September delivery, West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, closed at $23.11, up $1.57. It closed last week at $20.04.</p> <p>The Energy Department said late yesterday that for the first five months of this year, the United States imported 610,000 barrels a day from Iraq, less than 8 percent of total imports, and 120,000 barrels from Kuwait, which is less than one-half of 1 percent. Domestic crude oil stocks are 1.1 billion barrels, the highest level in eight years, the department said, and if imports are interrupted, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve of stored oil can be emptied at 3.5 million barrels a day for 170 days.</p> <p>Faster Reaction</p> <p>There are other differences from the shocks of the 70&#39;s. One is that markets are faster now and unregulated. The shouts of a horde of speculators are quantified and transmitted worldwide by computer, and customers will feel them quickly.</p> <p>Another change is that OPEC has been fundamentally split between countries like Kuwait, which diversified in the oil business so they could profit in a low-price environment, and countries that remained pure producers, like Iraq. If oil prices decline, so does Iraq&#39;s income.</p> <p>The Saudis would also like to keep prices down so that the oil in the ground worldwide - about a quarter of which they own - will be the primary fuel of the next century.</p> <p>One factor that has not changed is a frustrated desire to retaliate. Most of the responses, including the embargo of Iraq ordered by the White House, constitute the West&#39;s biting the hand that oils it.</p> <p>Effects of an Embargo</p> <p>At best, a Western embargo of oil from Iraq and its new acquisition would leave the world bidding up the price on the remaining OPEC output, say experts, hitting consuming nations with an increase at least as big as the one Iraq is seeking to impose.</p> <p>As Western governments cast about for levers of economic influence they can exercise over Iraq, experts say there are few.</p> <p>Some countries could exert immediate influence on Iraq; about a third of the country&#39;s exports go through Saudi Arabia, in a pipeline built during the Iran-Iraq war to avoid the Strait of Hormuz. But thus far, they have not chosen to turn the tap.</p> <p>The United States Navy could also respond. If bombers retaliated against Iraq by attacking its oil export facilities, &#39;&#39;it would add another $5 a barrel in a matter of seconds,&#39;&#39; predicted Marion B. Stewart, an energy expert at National Economic Research Associates, a private consulting group in White Plains, N.Y.</p> <p>Japan and Germany</p> <p>Presumably, the impact would be bad in Japan, Germany and other trading partners whose dependence on imports exceeds the 50 percent in this country.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The countries that get hurt the most are the oil-importing countries in the third world, like Morocco, Jordan, countries in Africa and India,&#39;&#39; said Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington.</p> <p>For industrial countries, the impact of an increase is likely to be smaller now, because their economies were fundamentally altered by the earlier oil shocks, and now use less energy for each unit of economic output. Of the energy they do use, a smaller fraction is oil. In the United States in 1973, oil&#39;s share of all energy sources was 46.9 percent; last year it was 42.1 percent. The decline in other countries has been steeper.</p>
802733>The F.A.A. Is Considering Rules on Icing Nearly a year after the crash of an American Eagle turboprop commuter plane,  which the Federal Aviation Administration attributed to ice, the agency is still studying whether 18 other models of turboprops used in this country are vulnerable to the problem. The aviation agency&#39;s associate administrator for regulation and certification said this week that, with winter near, the Government might impose restrictions on some turboprops in the next few weeks.  <p>Although some manufacturers have given the F.A.A. data on their planes&#39; performances in icing conditions, other manufacturers of the turboprops are just now performing the required tests. These include putting planes through high-speed taxiing tests and putting wings into wind tunnels with wooden blocks  on them to simulate ice.</p> <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has delayed a formal finding of the  probable cause of the crash of the American Eagle turboprop, an ATR-72, on Oct.  31. But the Federal Aviation Administration said the cause of the accident was a buildup of ice on the wings when the plane entered an area with an unusual weather condition called &quot;super-cooled drizzle drops.&quot;</p> <p>All 68 people aboard were killed when the plane plunged to earth in Roselawn, Ind., while it was in a holding pattern on a flight to Chicago from Indianapolis.</p> <p>The plane was made in France, and the French Government, which participated in the investigation, sought the delay to correct what it said were errors in the board&#39;s &quot;factual report,&quot; the basis for the finding of probable cause.</p> <p>The safety board&#39;s staff expects to complete its work soon, but by treaty the French Government will have 60 days to review it, which will push the conclusion into next year.</p> <p>The F.A.A. promised in March, at hearings on the American Eagle crash, that by Oct. 31 it would complete an evaluation of all other turboprops to determine  their vulnerability. In the interview, Anthony J. Broderick, the associate administrator, said that before the evaluations of other planes started, &quot;I would have said the ATR was uniquely susceptible&quot; to icing problems. Now, he said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure that &#39;unique&#39; is an accurate word,&quot; and that other planes may also have some vulnerability.</p> <p>But Mr. Broderick said none was as vulnerable. &quot;We don&#39;t have an ATR kind of  situation,&quot; he said. The reason is partly the ATR&#39;s wing design, which is extremely sensitive to small disruptions, he said.</p> <p>In the next few weeks, he said, the F.A.A. may issue new restrictions on the  conditions under which some of the 18 other models of turboprops may take off. The agency might order, for example, that some not be sent into areas where freezing rain or drizzle were falling or expected. Mr. Broderick said the most important measure was to keep planes out of holding patterns in areas with icing conditions. &quot;It&#39;s what has become a mantra of flying turboprops,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The ATR that crashed was certified for flying in icing conditions, but not as severe as what the pilots encountered, investigators have concluded. Investigators have concluded that the plane, as it flew its holding pattern, encountered a region of water droplets far larger than anticipated for F.A.A. certification rules. The pilots evidently had no clue they were in trouble until they began to retract the plane&#39;s flaps, a step that changed the air flow and led to loss of control.</p> <p>On the ATR, a buildup of ice farther back on the wing than a de-icing system  reached, created a ridge that disrupted the air flow. The plane&#39;s flight data recorder showed that an aileron, a moveable control surface on the trailing edge of the wing that is used to bank the plane, was pulled up. The plane went into an uncontrollable corkscrew dive.</p> <p>After the accident, the bigger de-icing systems, pneumatic &quot;boots&quot; that inflate to break off ice, were installed on ATRs. American Eagle asked its pilots to report all incidents of ice accumulation this summer, and about five reports were received, according to the airline and the F.A.A.</p> <p>None had any problem, but none encountered severe icing conditions, either, said Lance K. McDonald, vice president for flight operations of Simmons, an American subsidiary that flies planes under the name American Eagle. Mr. McDonald and Mr. Broderick said in separate interviews that the expanded boots seemed to have solved the problem.</p> <p>Bigger planes are not so susceptible to unwanted aileron movement because the ailerons are powered by hydraulic systems and cannot be moved by air currents. On turboprops like the ATR, they are usually controlled by cables and thus can be moved without any action by the pilot.</p>
361899>Plan to Increase Power At Indian Pt. Is Delayed Consolidated Edison has obtained permission from the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission to increase the power level at its Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor in Buchanan, N.Y., by 12.9 percent. But the utility has not been able to do so because of the discovery of cracks in metal vessels at the plant.  <p>The reactor was shut down on Feb. 24 for an inspection that was supposed to take four weeks but that is continuing, to allow repairs of the cracks. The utility would have liked to have the plant back in service by now because its period of peak summer electric demand is fast approaching. It now expects to start the reactor in a week.</p> <p>The consortium of the state&#39;s eight major utilities, the New York Power Pool, said last month that supplies &#39;&#39;should be adequate this summer, unless extreme weather conditions and unexpected equipment outages occur at the same time throughout the Northeastern part of North America.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>To help stretch the time between refuelings, Con Edison has also obtained permission to use more powerful fuel rods in its nuclear reactor. The company recently received permission to store the spent rods in a pool next to the reactor and to squeeze them closer together, to extend capacity.</p> <p>No Major Opposition</p> <p>The changes are occurring after a long period of intense controversy. In the early 1980&#39;s the Indian Point reactors were the subject of the longest series of hearings in the history of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The subject was the adequacy of emergency plans for the area surrounding the complex, which is on the Hudson River in Westchester County, 24 miles north of New York City.</p> <p>The changes occurred without active opposition. Joan Holt, who led the New York Public Interest Research Group&#39;s campaign against Indian Point in the 80&#39;s, said, &#39;&#39;We haven&#39;t been actively pursuing the options at this point because of a feeling we can&#39;t win.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>She cited changes in Federal procedures and the support of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo for the operation at Indian Point.</p> <p>The increase in power will put the reactor&#39;s output at 986 megawatts, up from 873. A spokeswoman for the utility, Lisa Robinson, said the 17-year-old plant had been designed for the higher level. Indian Point 3, almost a twin of Indian Point 2, operates at 965 megawatts. A megawatt, or one million watts, can light 10,000 100-watt bulbs.</p> <p>Higher Levels Possible</p> <p>With the intense controversy over safety at Indian Point apparently ended, Ms. Robinson said, and continuing growth in customer demand for power, Con Edison applied to increase the rating. It has not built major generating stations in recent years.</p> <p>Indian Point&#39;s output could be raised again, Ms. Robinson said, if Con Edison makes changes in the turbine, which converts steam to mechanical energy, and other systems.</p> <p>A safety analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, Robert Pollard, said in an interview: &#39;&#39;When you increase the power level, you&#39;re running closer to damage limits for the core. If you have an accident, your safety margin is reduced.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Indian Point 2 is not running at all now because of the cracks in its two steam generators, which are large steel vessels half-filled with thousands of curved tubes. Inside the tubes is radioactive water that has been heated in the reactor and is kept under pressure to prevent boiling. Outside the tubes is clean water under lower pressure that is boiled into steam and sent to the turbine.</p> <p>Some Possible Causes</p> <p>Last year workers found cracks in the welds of the vessels. Con Edison promised the Federal agency that it would close the plant in February 1990 to see whether the problem had worsened. Inspection then found new pitting and cracking, with some cracks extending three-quarters of an inch into the walls, which are three and a half inches thick. No one is sure why the cracks occurred.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We have been working with Westinghouse, the vendor of the steam generators, looking at possible causes for this,&#39;&#39; Ms. Robinson said. &#39;&#39;It would appear at this point to be a number of things.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Metal stress from repeated heating and cooling, variation in metal composition and water chemistry are possibilities, she said.</p> <p>A more common problem with the generators is leaks in the tubes that carry radioactive water. Indian Point 3 had to replace its generators because so many deteriorated tubes had to be plugged. Con Edison has bought replacement generators, but has not installed them, a job that takes weeks and costs millions of dollars.</p> <p>Increase Between Refuelings</p> <p>The utility has been trying to increase the time that the reactor is running by loading it with added fuel and running it longer between refuelings. Initially it ran nine to 12 months before shutting down for refueling. It is now operating 16 to 20 months at a stretch.</p> <p>The fuel consists of uranium 235, an isotope that is easily split, undergoing continuous fission to make heat, and uranium 238, which is not so easily split. Indian Point uses fuel that is 4.3 percent uranium 235. To increase the interval between refuelings and operate at a higher level, the plant is preparing to use fuel that is 5 percent uranium 235.</p> <p>The change requires altering the racks used to store fuel after it has been used. Last month Con Edison obtained permission to put in new racks that absorb neutrons, the subatomic particles that sustain a chain reaction. The new racks will also allow the fuel to be squeezed closer together, a step required because the pool was designed to hold spent fuel for just a few years.</p> <p>When the plant was designed, the utility anticipated that spent fuel would be collected often, to be reprocessed for valuable materials or to be buried. Reprocessing has proved infeasible, and the Government has had trouble finding disposal sites.</p>
540317>Making a Difference; A Year of Shakeups And Quips at the N.R.C. Marking the completion of his first year in office, Ivan Selin, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said last week that protests by citizen groups have helped move his agency in the right direction. These are the organizations that are politely referred to by the neutral term &quot;watchdogs,&quot; but given that most of the groups favor shutting down nuclear power plants, it was an out-of-character comment for a man in Mr. Selin&#39;s job. Mr. Selin, however, has taken a different view of his job than some of his predecessors, who were energetic boosters to the point of being cheerleaders. Mr. Selin said that after insuring the safety of existing plants, his top priority is building public trust, part of which means listening more to the public.  <p>Outsiders say he has shaken up his agency. &quot;Their way of doing business has changed,&quot; said Carl Goldstein, a spokesman for the U.S. Committee for Energy Awareness, which is the nuclear industry&#39;s public relations arm. He added that the chairman had &quot;enabled the agency to come out of its shell, to work in a more eclectic environment, to be more sensitive to the outside world.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Goldstein pointed to Mr. Selin&#39;s belief that the industry needs the public&#39;s acceptance, rather than mere acquiescence, to continue to operate. The reason is that some utilities will soon have to decide whether to apply for license extensions on aging reactors and, Mr. Goldstein and others hope, some will consider ordering new plants.</p> <p>Mr. Goldstein declined to rate Mr. Selin&#39;s performance, saying that the real test would come in the next four years, when the commission might get to try out streamlined rules for licensing new reactors. Many in the industry were not happy that the N.R.C. listened to the watchdogs in the case of Yankee Rowe, the 32-year-old plant in Rowe, Mass., that it ordered shut last September for more tests; in the end, the owners retired it.</p> <p>Mr. Selin, who came to the N.R.C. from the State Department and speaks six languages, has also cast new attention on the world nuclear scene and the role that the United States can play in improving safety in the former Soviet bloc.</p> <p>Mr. Selin, who is 55 years old, speaks with a sense of humor that also is not characteristic of previous chairmen. Asked last week if he had sent a check as a contribution to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the group that raised the arguments against Yankee Rowe that proved to be fatal, Mr. Selin turned his head away from the microphone that records everything in the commission&#39;s hearing room and said, with a smile, &quot;It bounced.&quot;</p>
759521>Design Could Have Been Another Enemy Whether they knew it or not, the terrorists who blew up the Oklahoma City Federal Building chose a target whose architecture might have made it more vulnerable to bomb damage than other designs. The building&#39;s front had four large columns supporting a horizontal beam, creating a two-story atrium -- a common design for low- to medium-rise buildings. Starting above the beam, other columns rose the rest of the way up the nine-story structure.  <p>When the blast eliminated three of the four columns under the beam, the beam collapsed, and then the building&#39;s upper floors &quot;dominoed all the way down,&quot; said Robert A. Wright, an architect with Locke &amp; Wright in Oklahoma City, a successor to the company that designed the Federal Building.</p> <p>The death toll was high because in the progressive collapse, section after section crushed people underneath it.</p> <p>In contrast, when a similar bomb exploded under the World Trade Center in New York, it blew out several concrete floors, killing six people, but the building&#39;s skeleton survived. Thousands of people were able to escape with nothing worse than smoke inhalation and twisted ankles.</p> <p>The Trade Center&#39;s columns were built in a straight line, from the sub-basement to the top, to bear the weight of 110 stories. Very strong at their base, they were not easily damaged by a bomb.</p> <p>But the Oklahoma City bomb was much larger than the Trade Center one. Under those circumstances, Mr. Wright said, the Federal Building performed well.</p> <p>&quot;The building was designed extra heavy,&quot; he said. &quot;The General Services Administration at that time just wanted a very substantial structure. We probably overdesigned it, and that&#39;s probably why a majority of the building is still standing. I don&#39;t think anything less would have stayed up at all.&quot;</p> <p>It is difficult to say whether the bomb, with as much force as it had, would have done as much damage if the design had been different.</p> <p>&quot;One of the things you don&#39;t want to do is to have staggered columns,&quot; said Robert A. Crist, a structural engineer who is an expert in how to harden buildings to withstand terrorist attacks. And an article in the November issue of Civil Engineering by a New York engineer, Paul Weidlinger, noted, &quot;Medium- and low-rise structures are usually quite vulnerable to close-in external explosions.&quot;</p> <p>The way to reduce bomb damage, experts agree, is to keep vehicles away from the building. Mr. Weidlinger pointed out that a car bomb with 1,000 pounds of explosives produced a force of 1,000 pounds per square inch at a distance of 10 feet -- say, the distance from a curb to a building facade.</p> <p>&quot;At a distance of 100 feet,&quot; he wrote, &quot;this will have decayed to an overpressure of 10 pounds per square inch.&quot; Most buildings are designed to support a steady load of about one pound per square inch, he said.</p> <p>The method of construction can also reduce damage, experts say. When the columns, beams and floors are tightly tied together, Mr. Crist said, the other elements can take up the load when one element is lost. In a good building, &quot;load can be transferred from beam to beam, beam to column, floor to beam, etc.,&quot; Mr. Crist said in an article he co-wrote for the National Academy of Sciences in 1988.</p> <p>The Federal Building in Oklahoma City may also have been more vulnerable because of its ground-level atrium and glass facade. The problem was not with flying glass -- a small hazard compared with collapsing concrete -- but with the way the blast was able to penetrate the glass easily and push up the floors at the lower levels, some experts said.</p> <p>Anatol Longinow, an engineer at Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, a Chicago firm that investigates structural failures, said that when a bomb explodes at street level, the blast &quot;expands spherically, and it hits the floors up instead of down,&quot; by coming in under them.</p> <p>&quot;The floors are not intended to go up in any event,&quot; Mr. Longinow said.</p> <p>If pushed in a direction opposite from normal, he said, the floors may break loose relatively easily and collapse in a pancakelike pile.</p> <p>TERROR IN OKLAHOMA: THE BUILDING</p>
799234>Aviation Safety Gear: Impossible to Protect The aviation safety device that was attacked at La Guardia Airport in New York City on Friday night was a twig in a vast forest of equipment spread around the country, from street corners to mountaintops, to help the Federal Aviation Administration locate aircraft and communicate with them. The system that was briefly damaged was meant to warn of a rare but deadly weather condition, wind shear, that has caused several crashes in the nation over the years. Experts said today that it was unlikely that whoever damaged the equipment knew what it was. They also said it was impossible to protect all the F.A.A.&#39;s equipment, because much of it operates without personnel and outside the airport fences. But many parts of the system are like individual traffic lights -- helpful but often dispensable, at least for short periods.  <p>The attackers damaged a device that monitors wind speed and direction and sends the information back to a central computer. Technicians familiar with such equipment, but not with the particular unit in Queens, said it usually has a weather vane, like an airplane without wings, on top of a utility pole, and an anemometer, a rotating device that measures wind speed. At the bottom of the pole are a small computer and a modem, in a box. Such boxes are generally not marked as belonging to the F.A.A.</p> <p>Along with five similar monitors spread around La Guardia, the equipment is part of a low-level wind-shear alert system, which sounds an alarm in the control tower in certain weather conditions. The F.A.A. would not say today whether the loss of one monitor had disabled the system, but it did say there was no threat to aviation safety.</p> <p>Wind shear is a condition in which the wind blows down to the ground, and then spreads out in all directions horizontally, like water being poured from a  pitcher to the floor.</p> <p>Wind shear is dangerous because it can keep airplanes from maintaining the minimum air speed they need to stay aloft.</p> <p>Approaching the center of such a downdraft, a pilot sees the plane&#39;s air speed increase, because the wind is coming toward the plane. But once the plane  has passed through the center of the downdraft, it moves abruptly into a horizontal air current coming from behind. That means the plane&#39;s air speed is slower -- sometimes slow enough to make it fall out of the sky.</p> <p>The low-level wind-shear alert system warns controllers, who can tell pilots, when contradictory readings on the ground indicate that wind shear may be present. Forewarned, pilots can increase engine thrust.</p> <p>Wind shear was first identified in the crash of an Eastern Airlines jet at Kennedy International Airport in 1975 that killed 113 people.</p>
36649>SENATE PANEL BLOCKS FUNDS FOR WEAPON REACTOR The Armed Services Committee of the United States Senate has voted to bar funds for reopening a troubled nuclear reactor in Washington State that is a key source of the nation&#39;s plutonium fuel for nuclear weapons.  <p>The N-Reactor, at the Hanford Reservation near Richland, Wash., resembles the Soviet Union&#39;s Chernobyl plant more closely than does any other reactor in the United States. It has been closed since December for safety improvements after the explosion last April at Chernobyl, the worst nuclear accident in history.</p> <p>A high-ranking Reagan Administration official said that failure to reopen the reactor could impair the military&#39;s ability to maintain the nation&#39;s nuclear arsenal. A Graphite Reactor</p> <p>The Senate panel&#39;s vote, in a closed session Wednesday, came in deliberations on a bill on military programs that the committee is expected to send to the full Senate today. It would bar funds for operation of the reactor but would permit the Energy Department to keep it ready to restart.</p> <p>The department expects to complete some equipment changes by July 1, along with improving training and operating procedures and completing an analysis of flaws that could cause an accident, according to Douglas C. Elmets, a department spokesman. But other changes recommended by experts selected by the department, including a system to purge explosive gases that could build up during an accident, would not be finished by then, he said.</p> <p>Like Chernobyl, and in contrast to the standard commerical designs in use in this country, the N-Reactor uses graphite blocks to facilitate the nuclear reaction. It also lacks the steel and concrete containment buildings that surround commercial reactors. But because of design differences, it is not subject to the same instability that triggered the Chernobyl disaster.</p> <p>The N-Reactor, which was designed for 20 years of use but is now in its 23d year, is one of six Energy Department facilities for producing plutonium fuel for nuclear bombs. But the committee vote comes at a time when all the others are showing problems. Energy Secretary Is Concerned</p> <p>Two are now shut, possibly permanently, and the other three are running at less than half of capacity because of safety questions. All five are at the Savannah River Plant, near Aiken, S.C.</p> <p>Secretary of Energy John S. Herrington said in a prepared statement that he was &#39;&#39;extremely concerned&#39;&#39; that the Senate committee&#39;s action could &#39;&#39;severely restrict the Department of Energy&#39;s ability to meet its responsibility for our nation&#39;s strategic deterrence capability.&#39;&#39; The N-Reactor represents one-third of the nation&#39;s plutonium production capacity, he said, and was needed to modernize nuclear weapons.</p>
1566745>Government Puts Out Call for Anthrax Vaccine The Department of Health and Human Services issued an open solicitation on Thursday for enough anthrax vaccine for 25 million people. The solicitation follows contract awards last September to two biotechnology companies to develop an experimental vaccine. One of those companies, VaxGen Inc., said at the time that the contract, which was for three years, paved the way for a significantly larger contract to develop a national stockpile of the vaccine.  <p>The existence of the government&#39;s new request for proposals was first reported in Friday&#39;s editions of The Washington Post.</p> <p>Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, said in a telephone interview on Thursday evening that VaxGen and a British company, Avecia, were still developing the vaccine. They would probably be in a good position to respond to the new request, Dr. Fauci said, but the competition would not be limited to them.</p> <p>The contracts signed in September were for the second phase of a test, he said. The first was to try a vaccine on a small number of people to look for side effects, and the second was to use on a larger number to see &#39;&#39;whether it induces a particular kind of immune response.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>While researchers will look for that immune response, they will not actually expose the vaccinated people to anthrax, he said.</p> <p>The government has announced plans to develop vaccines for a variety of &#39;&#39;high priority microbes or toxins,&#39;&#39; he said, including, in addition to anthrax, botulism toxin, plague, tularemia and hemorrhagic fever including Ebola.</p>
496507>POLLUTION LIMITS DEBATED FOR CARS State air pollution regulators and representatives of the automakers squared off for a debate Wednesday over whether New York should adopt California&#39;s tough standards on tailpipe pollution, and succeeded in making the audience, about 80 auto dealers, very nervous. But perhaps because of heightened environmental consciousness among their customers and among the dealers themselves, the New York State Automobile Dealers Association has not taken a position on the rules. The reason, one dealer suggested, is that the people who sell cars do not trust either the Government or the auto manufacturers.  <p>New York and 10 other states from Virginia to Maine have pledged to adopt the standards, which will require that, beginning in the mid-90&#39;s, cars emit far less carbon monoxide, a poison, and far less of the chemicals that cause smog. But the manufacturers, mounting a state-by-state resistance campaign, flew a team from Detroit to urge the dealers to oppose the rules.</p> <p>&quot;You will all remember 1981,&quot; said Al Weverstad, General Motors&#39; manager of emission compliance, referring to the year when Federal regulations required yards of extra vacuum tubing in every car, creating balky engines that caused what Detroit calls &quot;driveability problems.&quot; Warning of Price Increases</p> <p>&quot;Every time you force the technology, you take that risk,&quot; he said, arguing that if the new rules are adopted prices will rise by $1,000 a car, performance will drop and consumers will simply stop buying. Mr. Weverstad said that everything from baking bread to pumping gasoline to using hair spray adds chemicals to the air.</p> <p>But Thomas Allen, director of the Division of Air Resources of the Department of Environmental Conservation, said the automobile industry was being told to spend only a modest amount, per ton of pollutant removed, compared to what factories and other polluters were being ordered to do.</p> <p>&quot;To point at everybody else&#39;s ox and say, &#39;gore that one, get the fuel guys, get the hair-spray guys,&#39; is not fair,&quot; he said.</p> <p>None of this cheered the dealers gathered at a Holiday Inn near La Guardia Airport. They are having a miserable year because of the recession, and are not anxious to take on anything that a customer will not love.</p> <p>&quot;Think of the last thing they tried to sell that didn&#39;t run on gasoline: diesels,&quot; said Henry Famularo, the service manager at Penn Toyota in Roslyn, L.I. Sitting next to him was Frank Apollo, service manager at Sunrise Toyota in Oakdale, L.I. &quot;We have a few of those kicking around, very few,&quot; he said. &quot;People thought they were buying a car like a gasoline car, only it&#39;s not.&quot; The diesels started differently, drove differently and had to be maintained differently, he said, and buyers disliked them. Several Possible Changes</p> <p>Just what design changes the new rules would require is uncertain, but the cars available in a few years could include pre-heaters on catalytic converters that could make them slower to start, or incorporate more radical changes, like using natural gas or electricity instead of gasoline.</p> <p>Despite their wariness of new technology, though, the dealers are not rushing to Detroit&#39;s defense. Mark Schienberg, executive vice president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, an affiliate of the statewide group, said that before condemning the California rules, the dealers were waiting to see that &quot;this is not another air bag situation.&quot;</p> <p>In that case, he said, the dealers enthusiastically backed Detroit&#39;s contention that air bags were impractical, too expensive and perhaps dangerous, until Chrysler Corporation abruptly switched positions and began using them as a selling point.</p> <p>&quot;Down the road, five years from now,&quot; he said, &quot;I don&#39;t want Lee Iacocca riding around in a California car saying it&#39;s the best thing ever invented, and us getting another black eye.&quot; A Selling Point?</p> <p>Jason Grumet, an assistant to Mr. Allen at the Department of Environmental Conservation, also referred to the air bag case. &quot;My sense is that the one thing moving cars off your lots now is air bags,&quot; he said. He predicted that dealers could make a selling point of cleaner cars, too.</p> <p>The dealers are clearly divided. &quot;New York has had an air pollution program for 20 years, and I don&#39;t see any difference in the pollution,&quot; said Jim Farley, a Volkswagen dealer in New Hyde Park, L.I. &quot;They haven&#39;t proved to me that they&#39;re able to solve the pollution.&quot;</p> <p>Bob Bialer of Forest Hills Chevrolet criticized the system under which California passes rules that require inventions, but agrees to review the rules every two years and change them if the necessary technology has not been developed. That, he said, was like playing &quot;chicken&quot; by standing in front of oncoming cars and waiting for them to swerve.</p> <p>Mark Herrmann of Mark Buick in Yonkers said that he was not eager to offer anything for sale that would reduce customer convenience, as seat belt interlocks did in the 1970&#39;s. And if new pollution standards led customers to defer their purchases because they did not like the new cars, that would hurt sales tax receipts as well as dealers&#39; revenues.</p> <p>But he added: &quot;We do have a moral, social responsibility, not only to our children, but to our grandchildren. I don&#39;t know which way you should go.&quot;</p>
1774849>Mining for Diesel Fuel; The Search for New Oil Sources Leads to Processed Coal The coal in the ground in Illinois alone has more energy than all the oil in Saudi Arabia. The technology to turn that coal into fuel for cars, homes and factories is proven. And at current prices, that process could be at the vanguard of a big, new industry. Such promise has attracted entrepreneurs and government officials, including the Secretary of Energy, who want domestic substitutes for foreign oil.  <p>But there is a big catch. Producing fuels from coal generates far more carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming, than producing vehicle fuel from oil or using ordinary natural gas. And the projects now moving forward have no incentive to capture carbon dioxide beyond the limited amount that they can sell for industrial use.</p> <p>Here in East Dubuque, Rentech Inc., a research-and-development company based in Denver, recently bought a plant that has been turning natural gas into fertilizer for forty years. Rentech sees a clear opportunity to do something different because natural gas prices have risen so high. In an important test case for those in the industry, it will take a plunge and revive a technology that exploits America&#39;s cheap, abundant coal and converts it to expensive truck fuel.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Otherwise, I don&#39;t see us having a future,&#39;&#39; John H. Diesch, the manager of the plant, said.</p> <p>With today&#39;s worries about the price and long-term availability of oil, experts like Bill Reinert, national manager for advanced technologies at Toyota, say that turning coal into transportation fuel could offer a bright future. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a huge deal,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>There are drawbacks; the technology requires a large capital investment, and a plant could be rendered useless by a collapse in oil prices. But interest was high even before the rise in oil prices; three years ago, the Energy Department ran a seminar on synthetic hydrocarbon liquids, and scores of researchers and oil company executives showed up. The agency that runs municipal buses in Washington, D.C., and other consumers expressed interest.</p> <p>But the enthusiasm was not enough to overcome the fear of a drop in oil prices. Lately, however, the price of diesel fuel, which determines the value of this coal-based fuel, also called synfuel, has soared, as has the price of natural gas, which made plants like the one at East Dubuque ripe for change.</p> <p>Most of the interest is in making diesel using a technology known as Fischer-Tropsch, for the German chemists who demonstrated it in the 1920&#39;s. Daily consumption of diesel and heating oil, which is nearly identical, runs more than $400 million. The gasoline market is more than twice as large, but if companies like Rentech sated the demand for diesel, the process could be adapted to make gasoline.</p> <p>The technology was used during World War II in Germany and then during the 1980&#39;s by South Africa when the world shunned the apartheid regime there. Now Rentech is preparing to use an updated version.</p> <p>Sasol, the company that has used the technology for decades in South Africa, is exploring potential uses around the world and is conducting a feasibility study with a Chinese partner of two big coal-to-liquids projects in western China. Last August, Syntroleum, based in Tulsa, agreed with Linc Energy, of Brisbane, Australia, to develop a coal-to-liquids plant in Queensland.</p> <p>Other projects are in various stages of planning in this country, although the one here on the Mississippi River just south of the Wisconsin border has a head start.</p> <p>But people who think this technology will find wide use presume some kind of environmental controls, which the Rentech plant, thus far, does not have. Some environment and energy experts doubt that the method is compatible with a world worried about global warming.</p> <p>Unless the factory captures the carbon dioxide created during the process of turning coal into diesel fuel, the global warming impact of driving a mile would double.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s a potential disaster for the environment if we move in the direction of trying to create a big synfuel program based on coal to run our transportation fleet,&#39;&#39; said Daniel A. Lashof, of the Natural Resources Defense Council. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s a brown path and a green path to replacing oil, and Fischer-Tropsch fuel is definitely on the brown path.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But the Energy Department sees potential. In March, the Energy Secretary, Samuel K. Bodman, said in a speech that making diesel fuel or jet fuel from coal was &#39;&#39;one of the most exciting areas&#39;&#39; of research and could be crucial to the President&#39;s goal of cutting oil imports. He said that loan guarantees enacted in last summer&#39;s energy bill might be used for Fischer-Tropsch diesel fuel.</p> <p>In Des Plaines, Ill., near Chicago, a new company called GreatPoint Energy has developed, on a laboratory scale, a vastly improved process for turning coal into natural gas.</p> <p>The promise and the pitfalls are similar for both GreatPoint and Rentech. Measured in the standard energy unit of a million British thermal units, or B.T.U.&#39;s, coal sells for $1 or so, natural gas around $7. Diesel fuel is around $23. As with all energy conversions, turning coal into natural gas or diesel fuel means losing something in translation -- specifically, energy -- but if the price difference is big enough, the energy loss is not something that investors will worry about.</p> <p>But it also means carbon emissions, which causes concern to environmentalists. Carbon is released in converting coal into an energy-rich gas made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and then converting the gas into something more useful. Rentech wants to turn it into liquid fuel. GreatPoint wants to rearrange the molecules into natural gas.</p> <p>But coal is cheap and the energy possibilities are endless. For example, at the Rentech plant, a substation on the east side of the plant that currently pulls in electricity will send it out instead. And, uniquely in this country, the plant will take coal and produce diesel fuel, which sells for more than $100 a barrel.</p> <p>The cost to convert the coal is $25 a barrel, the company says, a price that oil seems unlikely to fall to in the near future. So Rentech is discussing a second plant in Natchez, Miss., and participating in a third proposed project in Carbon County in Wyoming.</p> <p>The plant here will &#39;&#39;bring back an industry that&#39;s shutting down,&#39;&#39; Hunt Ramsbottom, the company chairman, said of the fertilizer business. &#39;&#39;The goal is fuels, but to get the plant up and running, fertilizer is a good backstop.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>And it is all local. The coal will come from southern Illinois, by barge or rail. The diesel can go straight to terminals or truckstops in the area, said Mr. Diesch, the plant manager, and the fertilizer to local farms. An odd advantage is that today, most coal-burning power plants in the area use coal hauled from Wyoming, because its sulfur content is lower; burning high-sulfur coal encourages acid rain. But if the coal is gasified, rather than burned, filtering out the sulfur is relatively easy, and the sulfur changes from a pollutant to a salable product.</p> <p>Emissions of traditional pollutants -- that is, the ones the government regulates, and not carbon dioxide -- will be lower with coal than they were with natural gas, he said. Outsiders are interested, but skeptical, because of the carbon problem. &#39;&#39;It might serve our goals in terms of reducing oil dependence,&#39;&#39; said Phil Sharp, a former congressman from Indiana and now head of Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research organization in Washington. But &#39;&#39;they should take into account that we are headed to a carbon-constrained economy.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Robert Williams, a senior research scientist at Princeton, said &#39;&#39;it&#39;s a step backward&#39;&#39; to operate a plant like Rentech&#39;s without capturing the carbon. &#39;&#39;It almost doubles the emission rate,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Mr. Ramsbottom also sees the carbon dioxide problem. &#39;&#39;The worldwide production of Fischer-Tropsch fuels is going to ramp up dramatically, and carbon sequestration is on everybody&#39;s mind,&#39;&#39; he said. But the geology of this part of Illinois is not suitable for sequestering the carbon dioxide from these plants. Building a pipeline would be expensive and difficult to justify while carbon emissions are not taxed, experts say.</p> <p>GreatPoint has a different plan: move the plant where it can sell the carbon.</p> <p>Andrew Perlman, the company&#39;s chief executive, thinks it has value. &#39;&#39;Not only is it capturable, one of biggest advantages of the system is, we can locate our plant near a natural gas pipeline, in places where we can sell that carbon dioxide for a profit, using existing technology,&#39;&#39; he said. Oil producers inject carbon dioxide into old oil fields, to force oil to the surface.</p> <p>Backers also hope that methanization, the process GreatPoint uses, will succeed in part because it fits in with existing energy infrastructures, like gas pipelines and coal mines. If it did, it could have a profound impact on the balance of natural gas imports, lessening or eliminating the need for liquefied natural gas ports. Like Fischer-Tropsch diesel, methanization is not a new idea; one plant in North Dakota does it now, using a technology paid for under the Carter-era Synthetic Fuels Corporation. But GreatPoint is going about it in a new way, in which far less energy is lost in the transition. There is a potential to make fuels from gasification better than ordinary fuels. Robert Williams, a senior research scientist at Princeton University, points out that crop wastes and wood chips can also be gasified, producing carbon monoxide and hydrogen.</p> <p>Normally, biomass is thought of as carbon-neutral, because for each plant cut down for gasification, another grows and absorbs carbon from the atmosphere. But if biomass is gasified and the carbon dioxide sequestered by being pumped into the ground in the expectation that it will stay there, then atmospheric carbon actually declines for every gallon produced.</p> <p>From a greenhouse perspective, that is more attractive than what Rentech does now with the carbon dioxide from its plant here. It is sold to soft-drink bottlers. That keeps the gas sequestered until someone burps.</p> <p>The Energy Challenge</p> <p>Articles in this series are examining the ways in which the world is, and is not, moving toward a more energy-efficient, environmentally benign future.

1510950>Management Issues Looming In Inquiry on Shuttle Safety Senior officials of NASA said today that they were making progress in addressing the five technical recommendations made so far by the independent board investigating the breakup of the shuttle Columbia. But they would not say what the agency was doing about an issue the board has called just as important a cause of the disaster as mechanical failure: the space agency&#39;s management culture.  <p>&#39;&#39;There will be no attempt whatsoever to argue or defend a recommendation from the Columbia Accident Investigation Board,&#39;&#39; said Frederick Gregory, NASA&#39;s deputy administrator, who was visiting the Kennedy Space Center here to join the initial meeting of a new advisory panel that is supposed to critique the preparations to return to flight.</p> <p>But when asked about the board&#39;s inquiry into how information has flowed within NASA, Mr. Gregory replied, &#39;&#39;At this point we have not received any comments officially from the accident investigation board&#39;&#39; on the subject of management.</p> <p>The board is scheduled to release the main body of its report on Aug. 26. While the official communications have been technical, board members have dwelled at length on nontechnical subjects -- chiefly, how NASA lost focus on the hazard of liftoff debris and did not heed some of its engineers&#39; requests for military satellites to take pictures of possible damage during the flight.</p> <p>Mr. Gregory said NASA had always delayed its operations whenever it found something it did not understand that could pose a safety risk. The investigation board, however, has focused on occasions when NASA faced a problem that it did not recognize as a risk.</p> <p>Mr. Gregory appeared with Bill Readdy, the agency&#39;s associate administrator for space flight, and Bryan O&#39;Connor, the associate administrator for flight safety and mission assurance. Mr. Readdy, responding to another question about whether NASA would re-evaluate its culture, said, &#39;&#39;The comment that it&#39;s a culture thing maybe does apply in some small area.&#39;&#39; After the 1967 fire that killed the three Apollo 1 astronauts on the launching pad, he went on, it was a strong culture that &#39;&#39;got us to the Moon, and got us back to the mission.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>While NASA has spoken of returning the shuttle fleet to space by next spring, Mr. Readdy said the schedule would be determined by when NASA could achieve safety milestones, not by an arbitrary date. The planning for spring is simply to organize the work and energize NASA workers, he said. Still, agency officials have pointed out that without the shuttle, construction of the International Space Station cannot resume and full operations there cannot be carried out.</p> <p>Last week, the investigating board recommended that NASA equip the three surviving shuttles with cameras that could take pictures of the orbiter and the external fuel tank, the part that shed the debris that was fatal to the shuttle Columbia, and transmit those images to the ground.</p> <p>Over the last few months, it has also recommended better photography on liftoff, adding equipment so astronauts could repair the shuttle in orbit, inspecting the wing panels more thoroughly between flights and getting images from spy satellites while the shuttle is in orbit.</p> <p>The accident investigation board has recommended many specific goals but not the means to meet them. Harold W. Gehman Jr., the retired admiral who is the board chairman, favors this approach and has said his panel should tell NASA what to do but not how.</p> <p>One technical change not recommended by the board but under consideration by NASA is landing the shuttle either at Edwards Air Force Base in California, or here in Florida, but only when its path is to the northeast, rather than to the southeast, as was the case on Feb. 1.</p> <p>The change would mean that little of the shuttle&#39;s descent would be over land, lowering the risk of harm to people on the ground if another shuttle broke up on approach. The advisory panel that began work here today will monitor how NASA carries out the short-term recommendations of the Gehman board, the ones required before the next shuttle flight.</p> <p>Mr. Gregory said that all but one of the 27 members were outsiders and that they would spend the next three days in what he called &#39;&#39;Shuttle 101,&#39;&#39; familiarizing themselves with the system. Their agenda includes a tour of the hangar where the Columbia wreckage is laid out and a look at a sample bipod foam ramp, the structure that shed the debris that damaged the Columbia&#39;s wing. It also includes a look at the launching-pad structure that was dumping flakes of zinc oxide onto the orbiter&#39;s wing, leading to corrosion.</p>
147931>Texaco May Seek Stock Buyback Texaco Inc.&#39;s management is leaning toward a stock buyback and away from selling to its shareholders its stake in Texaco Canada, according to participants in the company&#39;s talks with Carl C. Icahn, its largest stockholder.  <p>Texaco and Mr. Icahn, continued their discussions yesterday about how the giant oil company should restructure itself.</p> <p>Texaco has committed itself to selling at least $5 billion in assets in order to raise shareholder values, after its emergence from bankruptcy proceedings last month. Mr. Icahn has said publicly that he believes Texaco, the nation&#39;s third-largest oil company, should be broken up and sold. Seeking Seats on the Board</p> <p>Mr. Icahn has been threatening a proxy fight at Texaco&#39;s annual meeting next month, seeking five seats on the company&#39;s 14-member board, and the company has brought a suit charging him with various securities laws violations.</p> <p>The two sides announced on Monday that they would adjourn Texaco&#39;s annual meeting, now scheduled for June 7 in Tulsa, Okla., if either side requested it. However, the talks, which have been going on for two weeks and are expected to continue through the weekend, have probably made a proxy fight by Mr. Icahn more difficult; He would scarcely have time to mail materials to Texaco&#39;s 211,000 shareholders and to solicit their proxies.</p> <p>Both parties have been reluctant to discuss their talks.</p> <p>But some people who attended yesterday&#39;s sessions said Texaco seemed to favor a share buyback. One method under consideration is a &#39;&#39;Dutch auction,&#39;&#39; in which shareholders would be invited to tender their shares at a certain price. The company would decide the dollar value it would invest in the share buyback program, and take back the shares, lowest-priced first, until the money was spent. Spin Off Seems Unlikely</p> <p>At the same time, management seemed to move away from one option previously considered, spinning off Texaco&#39;s shares in Texaco Canada to shareholders in the parent corporation, according to participants in the talks. Such a move would leave Mr. Icahn, who owns 14.8 percent of Texaco, as the largest shareholder in Texaco Canada.</p> <p>In a separate development, T. Boone Pickens said he had sold his small stake in Texaco. Mr. Pickens, the chairman of Mesa Petroleum, had applied to Federal regulators for permission to buy up to 15 percent of Texaco but apparently never approached that level. Three other parties have sought such permission in recent months, including Mr. Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc.; the Getty Petroleum Corporation, a gasoline distribution and marketing company, and Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Company, an investment banking firm.</p> <p>The company is also considering offering a special dividend, perhaps to make up for the approximately $3 in dividends lost by common shareholders during the bankruptcy proceedings, which lasted almost a year. Texaco entered bankruptcy after it lost a Texas court case to the Pennzoil Company, which had accused Texaco of illegally interfering in its agreement to buy the Getty Oil Company. Texaco bought Getty in 1984.</p> <p>Texaco settled the suit by paying Pennzoil $3 billion. The company&#39;s management has been seeking sales to cover that expense and a payment it owes the Energy Department for overcharges made during the period when crude oil prices were controlled.</p> <p>COMPANY NEWS</p>
332076>LICENSE IS GRANTED TO NUCLEAR PLANT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted today to give an operating license to the Seabrook nuclear reactor, the New Hampshire plant that many experts consider the most fought-over nuclear project in America.  <p>Opponents, including officials in the neighboring state of Massachusetts, say they plan to appeal the decision in court almost immediately, but some acknowledged that full-power operation is likely by summer.</p> <p>The commission&#39;s 3-to-0 vote was a victory for the position of John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff who, as Governor of New Hampshire, pushed hard for completion and licensing of the plant.</p> <p>Companies and Careers Affected</p> <p>The start-up of Seabrook is 11 years behind schedule and the cost, $6.45 billion, is now 12 times the original estimate.</p> <p>On its tortuous road to completion, the plant created the first bankruptcy of an investor-owned electric utility since the Depression, the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, and is widely credited with ending the career of a New Hampshire Governor, Meldrim Thompson Jr., who favored the plant, and helping pick a Democratic Presidential nominee, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, whose fight against the plant as Governor won him votes in the New Hampshire Presidential primary.</p> <p>More than 3,000 people have been arrested over the years trying to block construction, in a salt marsh in the coastal town of Seabrook. And millions of consumers in all six New England states, along with thousands of shareholders of the 16 companies that have had a hand in building the plant, have felt its effects.</p> <p>The vote today, conducted under heavy security, was expected and generated no debate among the commissioners. The three members who voted to grant the license were the chairman, Kenneth M. Carr, Thomas M. Roberts and Kenneth C. Rogers. The two other commissioners, Forrest J. Remick and James R. Curtiss, excused themselves from voting.</p> <p>Although several questions remain about the adequacy of plans to evacuate the area within 10 miles of Seabrook in case of an emergency, Mr. Carr said before the brief meeting this morning, &#39;&#39;We believe the license should be issued and that the plant can be operated safely.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Carr was booed by a dozen Seabrook opponents who wore gas masks and anti-contamination coveralls of the type worn by nuclear workers and carried signs reading, &#39;&#39;Radiation equals death.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>After the vote, about 50 protesters gathered in Seabrook outside the plant gates and shouted, &#39;&#39;It&#39;s not over until it&#39;s over.&#39;&#39; By late afternoon the group had swelled to about 125, and more than 30 protesters had been arrested for blocking traffic and trespassing, The Associated Press reported.</p> <p>Touting of Benefits</p> <p>Even before the vote, Seabrook&#39;s supporters and opponents distributed statements of reaction. Harold B. Finger, president of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, a group that campaigns for nuclear power, said, &#39;&#39;There&#39;s no question that as time goes on even the people who opposed Seabrook will recognize its benefits to their region and their way of life. It will light the homes and run the factories of New England while emitting no greenhouse gases and while displacing 11 million barrels of oil every year.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the vote was &#39;&#39;the culmination of a long line of irresponsible &#39;public-be-damned&#39; decisions by the N.R.C. He called the commission &#39;&#39;a rogue agency that lives by its own set of pro-industry rules.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Senator noted that before the plant was licensed the commission changed its rules to allow consideration of emergency plans written by utilities instead of public officials. Massachusetts had refused to submit plans for its six towns within 10 miles of the plant, deciding after the Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union that planning would be futile.</p> <p>Bleak Outlook on Appeals</p> <p>The commissioners authorized the staff to issue a license on March 8, but said that if appeals were filed in Federal court the staff should wait until March 15, to give the court time to act.</p> <p>While many opponents are optimistic about the appeal, Michael Mariotte, of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, an anti-nuclear group, said, &#39;&#39;The history of these appeals has not been good.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Representative Peter H. Kostmayer, Democrat of Pennsylvania, announced that the House Interior Subcommittee on General Oversight and Investigations would hold a hearing on March 30 to investigate the commission&#39;s decision today.</p> <p>Even Seabrook&#39;s supporters say the plant&#39;s travails helped destroy the domestic nuclear industry.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;What happened to us in building the plant is indicative of why no one will ever do it again, without drastic changes in the regulatory system and in financing,&#39;&#39; said Richard H. Bornemann, a vice president of the United Illuminating Company, of New Haven, the largest surviving builder of Seabrook.</p> <p>Years of Litigation</p> <p>Public Service decided in January 1972 to build twin reactors at Seabrook, at a cost of $973 million. Two years later Massachusetts began legal action to block construction, arguing that emergency evacuation would be impossible.</p> <p>That issue was to be the last, and most expensive snag. A year after the 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, after work was under way at Seabrook, the N.R.C. instituted stricter rules that required states and towns to submit plans for sheltering and evacuating the people within 10 miles of a plant, before the reactor could be licensed.</p> <p>Work on those plans for Seabrook proceeded until spring 1986, when the Chernobyl accident prompted Governor Dukakis to delay submitting plans for Massachusetts towns. He finally declined to submit any plans.</p> <p>Many towns in both Massachusetts and New Hampshire favored trying to block the plant by boycotting evacuation planning. But in New Hampshire, Governor Sununu had the state step in to submit the plans, over the towns&#39; objections. He had previously spoken vigorously in favor of Seabrook, and favored amending a New Hampshire law that denied Public Service any money for the plant until it was finished. Later, after Mr. Sununu had become chief of staff, President Bush signed an executive order authorizing Federal preparation of such plans.</p> <p>Seabrook&#39;s builders wrote the evacuation plans for Massachusetts, and the N.R.C. changed its rules to accept those plans.</p> <p>Only 4 Left in Pipeline</p> <p>Assuming that appeals fail, Seabrook would be the 110th commercial reactor in this country. Only four are in the pipeline. On Feb. 8, Comanche Peak 1, in Somervell County, Tex., received a test license, like the one Seabrook received last year, and Comanche Peak 2 and Watts Bar 1 and 2, in Spring City, Tenn., are under construction. The Shoreham reactor, on Long Island, is finished but under an agreement with New York State, will never operate. All the plants ordered since 1974 have been canceled.</p> <p>Before today, the license most recently issued last August was for the Philadelphia Electric Company&#39;s Limerick 2 plant, near Pottstown, Pa.; the reactor entered commercial operation this January.</p> <p>In their planned appeals to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the opponents say they will argue that Seabrook should not operate because a licensing appeals board within the N.R.C. found four flaws in the emergency evacuation plan. One is that while an emergency could require that tens of thousands of people on nearby beaches take shelter from fallout there is no plan for sheltering them.</p> <p>But a panel of administrative law judges hearing the license application said Seabrook should be licensed anyway, and the N.R.C. agreed.</p>
756626>Readying Indian Point for the Long Haul INDIAN POINT 3, shut for 25 months by management problems, is different these days: it smells of fresh paint, and it is crawling with inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as managers prepare to ask in a few days for permission to reopen the reactor in mid-May. But the owner, the New York Power Authority, says the bigger challenge is still ahead: making the plant run right for the long haul. Unless it can run well, the Power Authority&#39;s president, S. David Freeman, insists, it will not run at all, and the big challenge will come after the plant reopens.  <p>First, though, it must have Federal permission to run. When the authority shut the reactor, in February 1993, after various mechanical and procedural problems came to light, it did so voluntarily, but it also promised to get the Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#39;s permission before starting up again.</p> <p>So on Friday, 10 inspectors and a team leader were to finish two weeks of examining the plant. Among the issues were the status of fire protection: some of the actions that operators plan to take in case of fire might not be possible, according to internal analyses, because lighting and ventilation systems would fail. Other items to be resolved include whether the diesel generators, which would power emergency equipment in a blackout, are reliable; whether all the water intakes are properly protected from being blocked by shellfish; whether the control room air-conditioning is adequate, and various other plant systems&#39; performance. The inspectors are also looking at maintenance records, operator training and other &quot;human factors.&quot;</p> <p>Another question is whether managers are responding appropriately to engineers or other staff members who raise safety questions. Two supervisors were disciplined in December and January for comments to a fire engineer who was raising safety issues; the authority&#39;s president said that the comments could reasonably have been considered harassment.</p> <p>But a key ingredient of success, Mr. Freeman, the authority&#39;s president, said, would be the staff&#39;s ability to question all aspects of operations freely and make improvements. In the months leading up to the shutdown, he said, no one questioned operations, and mechanical problems built up. &quot;By failure to rock the boat, it was sinking,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Tomorrow the Nuclear Regulatory Commission team plans to meet at its headquarters outside Philadelphia to evaluate what it found; if everything meets with the inspectors&#39; approval, the plant could be running again by mid-May. The commission does not plan to say anything until a public meeting is held near the plant on April 27, but Diane P. Screnci, a spokeswoman, said last week, &quot;I haven&#39;t heard any bombshells.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;We don&#39;t believe that there&#39;s any reason why they won&#39;t be able to re-start at some point,&quot; Ms. Screnci said.</p> <p>&quot;Whether the mid-May date that they&#39;re aiming for is possible, I can&#39;t judge at this point,&quot; he added.</p> <p>The long shutdown may, in fact, have addressed most of the problems within the thick, steel-reinforced concrete walls. Outside, though, the environment is as hostile as ever; the state&#39;s demand for electric power is still damped down by economic slowdown and technological advances, and the price of the main competing source of energy, natural gas, is stubbornly low.</p> <p>That means tough competition for a power plant with 1,000 employees. The staff of the Environment Committee of the State Assembly calculated last year that power was available on the open market for 3 cents a kilowatt-hour -- the amount of power needed to run 10 hundred-watt lightbulbs for an hour -- but that the cost for Indian Point 3 was 4.4 cents. In fact, the cost last year was substantially higher, because $148 million was spent, and no power was produced. It was a dismal year, but the reactor is among the worst-performing in the country; it has run only about half the hours it could have since it was commissioned 19 years ago.</p> <p>Now, Mr. Freeman says, the plant will have to leapfrog in the rankings and run better than three-quarters of the reactors in the United States or it will be closed on the ground that it is uneconomical.</p> <p>&quot;We intend to be in that category or we will just have to shut it down,&quot; Mr. Freeman said to officials gathered at the plant for an open house at the end of last month.</p> <p>&quot;The toughest part of our job up here is ahead of us,&quot; he said. &quot;The restart is just the start; having this plant run both safety and with minimum risk, and economically, is a giant challenge.&quot;</p> <p>Charles Komanoff, a power plant performance expert in New York, said that getting into the top quarter of all plants is a difficult, ever-harder task, because nuclear power plant performance has been improving nationwide. Right now, he said, it means operating about 85 percent of the time, against Indian Point&#39;s lifetime average of about 50 percent.</p> <p>Some plants, in fact, have returned to service after lengthy shutdowns and performed well. Indian Point 2, the near-twin adjacent and run by Consolidated Edison, had personnel and equipment troubles in the early 80&#39;s but recently set a world record for days of continuous operation, more than 500.</p> <p>Others have not returned. Before Mr. Freeman came to New York, he was the head of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District in California, where the Rancho Seco reactor had operated fitfully for years; after an extended period for repairs and a trial run, it broke down again and was scrapped.</p> <p>Mr. Komanoff said in a telephone interview last week that the plant might run at 85 percent of capacity, justifying its operation. &quot;If the thing ran that high, and also you managed to lock in some cost cutting from the old operations and maintenance levels, you would undercut the grid,&quot; he said, referring to power that can be purchased off the electric grid in lieu of running the reactor. The saving, he predicted, could be a few million dollars a year.</p> <p>But more likely, he said, is that old parts begin to fail, the plant does not run nearly that well and major costs would follow. With the future of the plant far from certain, Power Authority officials acknowledged that they must fight the tendency of some employees to try to hide problems that could cost the plant money. That may have been what happened to the fire protection engineer who raised safety problems, officials said.</p> <p>Mr. Freeman said that the authority had responded appropriately, by having William Cahill Jr., the chief nuclear officer, discipline the supervisors. &quot;Cahill has chewed out everybody and his uncle,&quot; Mr. Freeman said. One supervisor was removed from issues involving fire protection, and, Mr. Freeman said of the fire engineers, &quot;We&#39;re putting our arms around these people.&#39;</p> <p>Indian Point will run well, the managers insisted, because the people who work there have embarked on a &quot;culture change&quot; of paying excruciating attention to detail and questioning the safety impact of every error. For example, in a conference room where plant executives briefed officials and reporters last month, they displayed a blackboard on which a committee had written an extensive diagnosis of why a team of technicians had recently been sent to fix two switches that control water flows in the plant, with a work order that specified the wrong switches.</p> <p>In nuclear plants, which have multiple redundant systems, the mistake is common and serious: if the reactor has two valves for each job and one is faulty, if the technicians take apart the one that is working right and look for a problem, the plant may be forced to shut because the only one left is faulty.</p> <p>In the bad old days, said Leslie M. Hill, the resident manager, no one would have bothered to analyze why the error had occurred.</p>
529997>Making a Difference; Cleaning Up on Pollution After years of hypothesizing among economists and utility experts about the wonders of emissions trading, the Wisconsin Power and Light Company last week became the first utility to announce that it had actually sold pollution credits. The company, which expects to build up the credits by exceeding Federal cleanup goals, sold the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Duquesne Light Company the right to emit an additional 25,000 to 35,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, the main ingredient of acid raid. In buying the credits, which can be used starting in 1995, the T.V.A. and Duquesne are in effect buying more time to install cleanup equipment or switch to cleaner fuels.  <p>For Wisconsin Power, it was a case of doing well by doing good, but not for the first time, said Erroll B. Davis Jr., the president and chief executive of the utility&#39;s parent, WPL Holdings Inc. The company, based in Madison, is far cleaner than the average utility because of Wisconsin&#39;s strict environmental laws and its own determination to cut emissions.</p> <p>For example, Wisconsin Power recently opened what it says is a first-of-a-kind plant to turn old tires into a fuel supplement for coal-burning electric plants. Six pounds of shredded tires are burned with each 94 pounds of coal. The rubber has about 25 percent more energy content per pound than coal and is a cheaper source of heat. Rubber also burns hotter than coal, and raising the boiler temperature helps cut some emissions, Mr. Davis said. &quot;The only ones objecting are the mosquitoes, because we are eradicating part of their breeding grounds,&quot; he added, referring to abandoned tires.</p> <p>Mr. Davis, 47, who has degrees in finance and engineering, came to Wisconsin Power in 1978, after stints at Xerox and Ford. He has been president since 1987.</p> <p>The sale of the emissions allowances will have a modest effect on the company, adding between $10 million and $20 million to annual revenues of more than $1.3 billion. But Mr. Davis said the sale underscores Wisconsin Power&#39;s efficiency of operation.</p> <p>&quot;There is little we can do in the utility industry that represents sustainable, competitive advantage,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to be as aggressive, creative and quick-moving as possible to sustain that advantage.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I don&#39;t know what we will come up with next,&quot; he added, &quot;but I&#39;m not going to accept the responsibility of being the sole creative person here.&quot; Mr. Davis said his object was to &quot;create an atmosphere that empowers people at lower levels to do things differently. That&#39;s very different from what you&#39;ll find in most of this industry.&quot;</p>
1313708>Law Firm Was Nuclear Industry Lobbyist While Advising Government on Dump Site The law firm hired to advise the Energy Department on how to open a nuclear-waste dump at Yucca Mountain, near Las Vegas, was simultaneously lobbying Congress and the administration on behalf of the nuclear power industry about crucial decisions involving the project. Critics call this a conflict and say it casts doubt on years of legal and technical work at Yucca Mountain, where the government has spent $4.5 billion so far to determine whether the site is suitable to isolate wastes for millenniums to come.  <p>The law firm, Winston &amp; Strawn, was being paid by the Energy Department and one of its contractors to help determine if the site was suitable, while also taking money from the industry to assure that the site was approved.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You could make a case that every piece of data since 1992 is tainted,&#39;&#39; said Robert R. Loux, the head of the Nevada Nuclear Projects Office, a state agency created to oppose the repository.</p> <p>Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said, &#39;&#39;Of course it&#39;s a conflict. What would happen if, when I was practicing law, somebody came to me and had a problem and I took money from them, and somebody else gave me money to sue them?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Reid said the Energy Department should have known better.</p> <p>But a spokeswoman at the department, Jill Schroeder, said, &#39;&#39;We found them eminently qualified. We have not found a conflict of interest.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Referring to the Yucca site, Ms. Schroeder described the firm&#39;s role as helping the department decide &#39;&#39;whether or not it could be licensed.&#39;&#39; The department has not made a decision on opening the site, but anticipates doing so by the end of the year. It is then to make a recommendation to the president. Congress picked Yucca as the lead candidate for the nuclear disposal site in 1987.</p> <p>The nuclear power industry is eager to find a permanent disposal site for its waste and is pushing the government to open Yucca Mountain. Under a 1982 law, the department was supposed to begin accepting waste from the utilities in 1998.</p> <p>The dual role by Winston &amp; Strawn seems likely to add more uncertainty to the project, which is already 12 years behind schedule and faces more technical and legal challenges.</p> <p>The firm filed a disclosure form with Congress saying it stopped the lobbying on July 11, but no one at the firm would return repeated phone calls seeking comment.</p> <p>The disclosure forms for the early years list several bills on which it lobbied. The bills would have required the department to accept waste for temporary storage in anticipation of opening the site; in later years, the firm listed the subject of its lobbying as &#39;&#39;nuclear issues.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>At the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry&#39;s trade association, which hired Winston &amp; Strawn as its lobbyist, Mitch Singer, a spokesman, said, &#39;&#39;Why the relationship was ended, the only thing I can think is because they&#39;re doing all this work for the Department of Energy, and they felt it would be a conflict if they were continuing to do work&#39;&#39; for the institute. He said the firm was &#39;&#39;very conservative&#39;&#39; about avoiding the appearance of a conflict.</p> <p>Asked if the firm had compromised its work for the Energy Department, Mr. Singer said, &#39;&#39;I can&#39;t answer what went on in the past.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Winston &amp; Strawn picked up its first major role at Yucca Mountain in 1992, when it was hired as a subcontractor to the TRW Corporation, then the Energy Department&#39;s main contractor for examining the mountain, a volcanic ridge 90 miles north of Las Vegas. The firm&#39;s job was to advise TRW on preparing an application for a license, which the department was supposed to submit to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p> <p>In 1999, the department hired the firm to review the application before submitting it to the regulatory agency. A protest was filed by a competing law firm, LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &amp; MacRae, which complained that this amounted to the government&#39;s  paying Winston &amp; Strawn to review its own work. That case is pending in Federal District Court.</p> <p>While working for TRW and the Energy Department, the firm also lobbied the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on an issue crucial to Yucca Mountain: establishing the maximum radiation dose people living near the site should be exposed to.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;That would have come up in discussion,&#39;&#39; said a member of the five-person commission in the period.</p> <p>This person said he was lobbied by James R. Curtiss, a partner with Winston &amp; Strawn who is listed as a lobbyist in the disclosure forms. Mr. Curtiss himself served on the commission from 1988 to 1993.</p> <p>Mr. Curtiss and another partner at the firm listed as a lobbyist for the industry, Beryl F. Anthony Jr., a former member of the House of Representatives, did not return numerous phone calls.</p> <p>Energy Department regulations on the contractors doing business with it say conflicts of interest should be avoided &#39;&#39;to ensure that the contractor is not biased because of its financial, contractual, organizational or other interest which relate to work under the contract.&#39;&#39;</p>
867523>Length of Crash Inquiries Varies Based on Time Needed to Recover Evidence After the crash of Pan Am 103 at Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, it took investigators seven days to announce that the cause was a bomb. But after a Boeing 737 crashed on approach to Pittsburgh in September 1994, the F.B.I. spent weeks trying to determine if someone sabotaged the plane to kill a passenger who was a Federal drug informer. But that theory proved wrong,  and the cause of that crash is still not certain, though a mechanical problem is suspected.  <p>The crucial evidence needed to get a good idea of what caused a crash differs from accident to accident, and so does the time needed to find it. Sometimes, investigators come up with the answers in two or three days -- other  times, never.</p> <p>The problem with T.W.A. Flight 800, investigators say, is that the best evidence is usually found in plane parts that do not float, and that because of  weather, they have not raised anything from the bottom since the crash on Wednesday night.</p> <p>The water, though, is quite shallow by salvage standards, only about 140 feet at the deepest. Often, flight data recorders and other aircraft parts from other crashes have been retrieved from thousands of feet of water. And four days is not a very long time by most crash-investigation standards. Some crash investigations have gone much faster, but others have taken much longer, even when the plane crashed on land.</p> <p>The American Airlines 757 headed to Cali, Colombia, from Miami crashed on the night of Dec. 20, 1995, and searchers found the &quot;black boxes&quot; two days later. Shortly after, the National Transportation Safety Board read out the data, and it was obvious to investigators that the cause was human error.</p> <p>The investigation into the Valujet DC-9 crash in the Everglades on May 11 took a little longer, and for several days, a bomb was among the theories. There were three crucial clues in the crash: the co-pilot&#39;s radio transmission about smoke in the cockpit, along with shipping records that never left the ground about oxygen generators put improperly in the forward cargo hold, and an indication on the flight recorder of a sudden, brief rise in cabin pressure.</p> <p>The crash was at midday on May 11, and discovery of the conclusive piece of evidence was announced by the safety board on the evening of May 14, a day after the flight data recorder was found in the mud of the Everglades.</p> <p>The crash in Roselawn, Ind., of an ATR-72 turboprop operated by American Eagle was resolved almost as rapidly. It went down in a bean field on Oct. 31, 1994, and the flight data and voice recorders -- the &quot;black boxes&quot; -- were found in the mud on Nov. 2.</p> <p>By the next day, investigators had a detailed picture of the plane&#39;s trajectory, and by Nov. 4 they very strongly suspected the problem was related to icing in flight. A full public explanation did not appear until hearings held four months later, and a formal declaration of the cause did not come until earlier this month.</p> <p>Only twice in recent years has the F.B.I. taken over an investigation because of a finding that the cause was criminal, and both conclusions came quickly.</p> <p>When a Pacific Southwest commuter plane crashed on Dec. 7, 1987, with 43 people on board, the pilot said in a transmission shortly before the crash of his jet that there had been gunfire in the cabin. There were no survivors. Two days later, the F.B.I. found the pistol, and soon after, a note from a disgruntled former airline employee that explained why he was about to shoot the two pilots.</p> <p>Early on, investigators thought the former employee had also had a bomb, but  later, they decided that he did not and that the cause of the crash was the killing of both pilots.</p> <p>Last October, when Amtrak&#39;s Sunset Limited, en route to Los Angeles from Miami, derailed near Hyder, Ariz., investigators decided almost immediately that it was sabotage because they found a rail with missing bolts. They also found a  note claiming responsibility. Despite those initial leads, the case is still unsolved.</p> <p>THE FATE OF FLIGHT 800: THE TIMETABLE</p>
273861>4 Say Atom Industry Ordered Counseling And Harrassed Them At least four workers who complained about safety and environmental problems at four military nuclear plants run for the Government by private contractors say they were ordered by their superiors to see psychiatrists or psychologists.  <p>The workers and their lawyer all say that they believe the orders came as retaliation for the allegations they made. In two highly publicized cases the allegations against the contractors were confirmed; in the others, they have been rejected. Harassment Campaigns Charged</p> <p>The workers all say the implication in the orders that they were suffering from mental problems was part of a long campaign of harassment that included tactics like demotions, ridicule in front of co-workers and threats to revoke the security clearances required for their jobs. Three went to the psychologist or psychiatrists at least once; one refused but fears retaliation for his refusal.</p> <p>The companies involved deny having ordered the use of health professionals inappropriately.</p> <p>Workers who have made public allegations of wrongdoing by the Government and its contractors have complained for years that they have been punished for calling attention to problems. The Department of Energy has previously acknowledged to Congress that it has done a poor job of protecting whistle-blowers in the plants it owns. Letter of Complaint</p> <p>A spokesman for the department, Philip D. Keif, said a response was being prepared to allegations that the department and its contractors were retaliating against employees by referring them to mental health professionals. &#39;&#39;Obviously, we don&#39;t employ a policy to harass in such a way,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Thomas Carpenter, a lawyer representing the four workers, complained about the referrals in a letter on July 13 to James D. Watkins, the Secretary of Energy.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The use of psychiatric fitness-for-duty examinations in whatever context essentially has been retaliatory, punishing dissidents by labeling them mentally incapable of service to their country,&#39;&#39; wrote Mr. Carpenter, who is with a watchdog group, the Government Accountability Project. He said the tactic was intended to damage the employees&#39; careers and &#39;&#39;sense of self-worth.&#39;&#39; &#39;Do You Kick Your Dog?&#39;</p> <p>One employee, Edwin L. Bricker, operates equipment for processing nuclear materials at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington State. He said his sessions with two psychologists included questions like &#39;&#39;How do you feel about your fellow workers, your employer, and do certain things tick you off?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;They ask, &#39;How do you feel about your mother? Do you kick the dog?&#39; &#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I was terribly embarrassed,&#39;&#39; Mr. Bricker said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s humiliating, degrading.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Representative Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who has become a specialist on Hanford, said: &#39;&#39;This is an old strategy that goes on in totalitarian countries. It&#39;s incredibly grotesque that it&#39;s being pursued here.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Bricker told Congressional investigators several years ago that while preparing for a tour of Hanford by Gov. Booth Gardner of Washington, he and another worker were ordered to remove contractors&#39; signs warning that an area was contaminated. His assertion was later substantiated. An Assault by Fellow Worker</p> <p>Mr. Bricker has also made scores of other complaints, saying fires went unreported, a control room was left unattended or staffed by unqualified personnel, and compartments for handling plutonium that were supposed to be sealed had loose windows. Those complaints were rejected by the contractors.</p> <p>He said he suffered a variety of retaliations, including a physical assault by a fellow worker and assignment to pick up cigarette butts.</p> <p>When Mr. Bricker was sent to Dr. Booth, Hanford was run by the Rockwell International Corporation. A spokesman for Rockwell referred questions to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the current operator, but a spokesman for Westinghouse said the company could not answer questions about events there before it took over.</p> <p>A spokesman for Westinghouse said Mr. Bricker had in fact been harassed by fellow workers, who feared that attention to the problems might result in shutdown of the plant and the loss of their jobs. But the spokesman said the company had done everything it could to stop such harassment.</p> <p>The Westinghouse spokesman, L. B. Moore, said the jobs Mr. Bricker could do were limited because he had health problems, including a skin condition that prevented him from wearing the protective clothing needed in radiation areas. &#39;&#39;He may indeed have been put on a cleanup detail,&#39;&#39; he said. Psychologist Saw Others</p> <p>The psychologist who first saw Mr. Bricker said in a telephone interview that in four and a half years at Hanford, he had seen about six workers after they had complained about safety there. The psychologist, Ray Booth, now with Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center in Boise, said some were referred by managers but others came voluntarily because of the stress of confronting their bosses.</p> <p>The system of referring workers to him was vulnerable to abuse, he said. But he added, &#39;&#39;If a manager is doing this nefariously, I&#39;m not likely to know about it.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>He said of Mr. Bricker, &#39;&#39;Nothing derogatory came out of my evaluation of him.&#39;&#39; Westinghouse Role in Dispute</p> <p>Mr. Bricker said he was also ordered to see a psychiatrist by his supervisors after Westinghouse took over the management. Westinghouse asserts that it never ordered Mr. Bricker to see a psychologist, only to go to the Hanford Environmental Health Foundation, a Westinghouse contractor, for a &#39;&#39;comprehensive medical evaluation.&#39;&#39; The reason, according to Westinghouse, was that Mr. Bricker told Westinghouse in writing that he had experienced &#39;&#39;work-caused stress.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>If Mr. Bricker was sent for psychological evaluation, said Mr. Moore, it was a decision by the health clinic. But according to Mr. Bricker, the clinic psychologist said in his notes that Westinghouse requested the psychological evaluation.</p> <p>Mr. Carpenter, the lawyer for the Government Accountability Project, asserted that the notice for Mr. Bricker to see a psychologist came five hours after Mr. Bricker filed a safety complaint with the Department of Energy. Complaint at Ohio Plant</p> <p>At a Government weapons plant near Fernald, Ohio, Gene Branham, a heavy equipment operator, said he was ordered to see a psychiatrist in 1985 while he was a union officer involved in contract negotiations. &#39;&#39;They knew exactly what they were doing, timing-wise,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>As a union official at the plant, the Feed Materials Production Center, Mr. Branham had brought many safety grievances to management&#39;s attention, he said. In addition, after he saw an accidental release of uranium into the atmosphere in 1983 and the response that followed, he complained about emergency preparations. The Government now acknowledges that the plant has released uncounted tons of uranium dust into the surrounding area.</p> <p>Fearing for his job, which he has held since 1953, he agreed to go to the psychiatrist. &#39;&#39;Never for a minute did I feel I wasn&#39;t in control of my faculties,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Branham, who is 55 years old. But after being criticized by superiors, being dismissed at one point but later reinstated, and then being referred to the psychiatrist, he said, &#39;&#39;I did wonder if it was worth it - they were making it sort of hard for me.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Until December 1985 the plant was operated by a subsidiary of NL Industries, NLO. Robert Leidich, a spokesman for NL Industries, said the company now had no record of having requested that Mr. Branham go to a psychiatrist.</p> <p>Mr. Moore, the spokesman for Westinghouse, which took over the plant in 1986, said that Mr. Branham was &#39;&#39;a highly vocal union leader,&#39;&#39; but that &#39;&#39;he has never been, as far as I know or anyone I&#39;ve ever talked to, identified as a whistle-blower.&#39;&#39; Rocky Flats Fraud Case</p> <p>A worker at the Rocky Flats weapons plant near Denver said he was first ordered to see a psychiatrist after he helped expose fraud in a plant shop where Rockwell employees, using Government materials, were building items like grandfather clocks and hardwood staircases. Rockwell, the operator of the plant, eventually paid the Government $150,000, through a reduction in its management fee, to make up for the fraud.</p> <p>The man, a 40-year-old tool and die maker who has been at Rocky Flats since August 1979, agreed to an interview under the condition that he not be identified. He said that after he made more complaints about lapses in procedures, he was ordered to go for psychiatric help again when Rockwell officials said he was under emotional straing.</p> <p>Dennis Hurtt, a spokesman for Rockwell, said he could not discuss the issue because &#39;&#39;this is a personnel matter, whether this fellow purports to be a whistle-blower or not.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Describing the worker as &#39;&#39;a disgruntled employee,&#39;&#39; Mr. Hurtt said, &#39;&#39;The harassment thing is ludicrous.&#39;&#39; Engineer Tells of Problems</p> <p>In the fourth case, a 30-year veteran of Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, near Schenectady, N.Y., was in charge of environmental safety and health at the laboratory when he filed a report concerning asbestos contamination, fire protection problems and other safety lapses. The man, an engineer who had worked for years on naval propulsion reactor design, spoke on the condition that his name not be used.</p> <p>The engineer said that he was demoted and that after seeking re-instatement to his former job, he received unsatisfactory ratings on his performance, was threatened with a salary cut and told to see a psychologist.</p> <p>Gerry E. Sabian, a spokesman for General Electric, which runs the plant, said the engineer &#39;&#39;is not a whistleblower and there have been no reprisals against him.&#39;&#39; He was removed from the environmental safety and health job because he did not perform satisfactorily, the company said. And, Mr. Sabian said, the engineer was never ordered to see a psychologist.</p> <p>But the engineer said the company not only ordered him to go, but also gave him the name of the psychologist he was to see. He has refused so far.</p>
1788353>The Loneliness of the Air Traffic Controller In the movies, air traffic controllers are usually in big, crowded rooms, glued to their radar screens seemingly by the dozen, passing urgent messages to each other and barking orders to pilots through their headsets. But as the crash of a regional jet in Lexington, Ky., last week showed, at some airports air traffic control can at times consist of one lonely soul.  <p>Blue Grass Airport, where the crash occurred, has more controllers than some airports, though not the nine or 10 that a hectic one like Kennedy in New York has during its evening shift. And early last Sunday, when a Comair jet turned onto the wrong runway and crashed upon takeoff, only one controller was on duty at Blue Grass.</p> <p>That controller was using a radar screen to direct an outbound flight around bad weather while he cleared the Comair flight to take off from the proper runway. He then turned away to do other work.</p> <p>The crash, which killed 49 of 50 people on board, immediately followed two take-offs, but in the three hours before that there were no flights at all.</p> <p>Even with a sole controller, though, Lexington is better staffed than some other airports where commuter flights land; many of those have part-time towers, meaning that landings and take-offs with no controller are common. A controller in a distant regional radar center may assume control once the plane is airborne.</p> <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has issued its managers conflicting instructions; they are supposed to avoid having a tower controller perform both ground and radar duties, but also to minimize manpower to the lowest level consistent with safety. The F.A.A. once had negotiated agreements with the controllers&#39; union on staffing levels; now it says it tries to &#39;&#39;staff to traffic.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>At Kennedy, for example, according to Barrett Byrnes, a union official at the airport&#39;s tower, there used to be 12 to 14 controllers on the evening shift, but the F.A.A. had reduced staffing.</p> <p>In the wake of the crash, however, the agency moved to increase staffing, at least at Blue Grass. It ordered a second controller for the overnight shift on weekends.</p> <p>MATTHEW L. WALD</p> <p>The Basics</p>
268517>Managers at Seabrook Shuffled After Incident The company that runs the Seabrook nuclear plant yesterday announced a management realignment, naming a new chief operating officer and replacing a vice president who left the company in June after a lapse in safety procedures. The company also shifted responsibilities for its licensing, engineering and plant operations.  <p>The management changes come almost a month after a mechanical failure at the plant that allowed cooling water to fall below an agreed-upon level. The seriousness of the incident was compounded when operators failed to shut the reactor down promptly when urged to do so by technicians from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p> <p>After the incident, Edward A. Brown, the president of the division of Public Service of New Hampshire that runs the plant, relieved George Thomas, the vice president of nuclear production, of his duties. Mr. Thomas later resigned from Public Service.</p> <p>Mr. Brown later said Mr. Thomas had made unauthorized and inappropriate statements to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission during a conference call after the incident, which occurred June 22. The statements were &#39;&#39;regarding his desire to restart the reactor before the completion of a full evaluation of the shutdown,&#39;&#39; Mr. Brown said. Mr. Brown announced yesterday that Ted C. Feigenbaum, vice president of engineering, licensing and quality programs, had been promoted to senior vice president and chief operating officer.</p> <p>Mr. Feigenbaum, 39 years old, has more than 17 years&#39; experience in the nuclear field and has been at Seabrook, in the New Hampshire seacoast town of the same name, since 1984.</p> <p>Bruce L. Drawbridge, 37, was named executive director of nuclear production. He will be responsible for plant operations until a permanent replacement is named, the company said, assuming Mr. Thomas&#39;s responsibilities.</p> <p>R. Jeb DeLoach, 43, will assume Mr. Feigenbaum&#39;s responsibilities in engineering and licensing. Neal A. Pillsbury, who is 46, will be responsible for quality engineering. The changes take effect Monday.</p> <p>Seabrook has a low-power license, but operators agreed not to restart the reactor until the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had approved the analysis by the company of the mishap and its &#39;&#39;short-term and long-term corrective actions.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The plant has been blocked from winning an operating license because of the objections of Massachusetts. Six Massachusetts towns are within the 10-mile emergency zone, and they have tried to block emergency planning efforts.</p> <p>Mr. Brown, in a statement, said, &#39;&#39;This strong, experienced management team will provide the leadership to insure that Seabrook Station will be in a position to receive a commercial license around the end of this year, and be producing safe, reliable and clean electricity early in 1990.&#39;&#39;  BUSINESS PEOPLE</p>
466152>Con Ed Is Told To Shift Goal To Efficiency For close to 20 years, the clean, cheap power generated by Canada&#39;s dams has been the solution whenever New York&#39;s utilities have looked for more electricity. Now, pressure is mounting on the state and the Consolidated Edison Company to put their long-term investments into something even cleaner and possibly cheaper: conservation. Mayor David N. Dinkins plans to ask New York State today to delay signing a new contract that would provide Con Ed with large amounts of hydroelectricity from Canada from 1995 to 2016. His administration says that the $6.1 billion that the contract would cost Con Ed would be better spent on subsidies to businesses and homeowners to adopt a variety of energy-saving devices. Investing in conservation and buying electricity from small independent generators, city officials say, would be cheaper and possibly more secure.  <p>Con Edison is already planning to spend $4.1 billion over the next 17 years on conservation programs intended to save 26 percent of its current generating capacity, a savings of five times as much power as the hydroelectric contract would bring. But as New York State approaches a deadline to complete the Canadian contract, utility officials say they are not sure they can rely on conservation to achieve more than they have already planned.</p> <p>Rejecting new hydroelectric purchases in favor of more conservation would be a huge change in the state&#39;s energy policy.</p> <p>While utilities around the country have recently moved heavily into promoting energy efficiency rather than new construction, and while the New York Public Service Commission has made it financially attractive for utilities here to do the same, the real decisions have not confronted Con Ed yet. The utility began the 1990&#39;s with surplus capacity and has not thus far used increased efficiency as a substitute for pouring concrete or signing new contracts with suppliers.</p> <p>Howard F. Squadron, the city&#39;s Commissioner of Telecommunications and Energy, described the city&#39;s argument in an interview as &quot;part of an overall turn in the road,&quot; in which the way electricity is used has become as important as the way it is generated. How Much &#39;Enlightened Energy&#39;</p> <p>But the company has a marked reluctance to rely on more demand-side management, as efficiency is known in the industry, than it has already planned for in its current campaign, called Enlightened Energy.</p> <p>The company plans to spend $73 million on promoting conservation this year, which is equal to about 10 percent of its capital budget, and $4.2 billion between now and 2008.</p> <p>&quot;The issue on Enlightened Energy is how much more you can get,&quot; said John E.  Deegan Jr., senior vice president of the company.</p> <p>Among other goals, Con Ed already plans to subsidize or otherwise encourage the replacement of 89 percent of the commercial and industrial lighting in its 660-square-mile service territory, along with 64 percent of the commercial electric air conditioners and 60 percent of the residential refrigerators. Like an Extra Indian Point</p> <p>By 2008 Enlightened Energy is supposed to reduce the summer peak load by 2,425 megawatts and winter load by 955 megawatts. (The summer effect is higher because Con Ed has focused its efforts on summer demand, which is higher, and its steps to make air conditioners more efficient and switch some air conditioners to steam or gas power do nothing to affect winter demand.)</p> <p>Stated differently, conservation by 2008 will give Con Edison as much electricity in winter as another Indian Point nuclear plant would. In summer, it would be like having another Indian Point plus another Astoria complex.</p> <p>These gains are far larger than anything Con Ed has tried before, and utility experts outside the company are not certain they are possible.</p> <p>&quot;They probably won&#39;t get everything they want to get, but they&#39;ll get a good chunk of it,&quot; said William J. Balet, the executive director of the New York Power Pool, a utility consortium that helps plan power supplies and arrange power transfers between utilities. It may be 10 years, he said, before it is clear how much power is available through conservation.</p> <p>Con Edison has gone after efficiency improvements in part because it can make a big profit that way. In addition to selling high-efficiency light bulbs at subsidized rates, it is offering businesses subsidies if they will replace motors, air conditioners and lights with equipment that does the same work for less power. The initial response has been good from businesses and nearly overwhelming from residences, where 106,000 customers have taken up the utility on its offer to sell cut-rate bulbs that use only 25 percent of the electricity used by regular ones.</p> <p>On the commercial side, Con Ed is helping big buildings in Manhattan pay for installing air-conditioning equipment run by steam or natural gas, both of which are in surplus in summer.</p> <p>Although Con Ed loses money on each bulb it sells, it can recover its expenses through electric rates, both for the subsidies it pays and for the lost profits on power it no longer sells. And if it passes certain milestones in energy conservation, it is allowed to earn a higher rate of return on the money its shareholders have invested in the electric system.</p> <p>The State Power Authority is nearing the December deadline to decide whether to give final approval to the contract to import 1,000 megawatts from Hydro Quebec. In the past, the utility, which is owned by the province, has supplied up to 10 percent of the state&#39;s electricity in normal years.</p> <p>A spokesman for Mr. Squadron said that Mr. Dinkins would send a letter today to Richard F. Flynn, the chairman of the Power Authority, seeking a delay in the deadline for approving the contract, to leave time for more analysis of economic and environmental issues. Electricity Market Changed</p> <p>Negotiations began in the late 1980&#39;s and a preliminary version was signed in 1989. Since then, the electricity market has changed substantially, with conservation measures and independent producers put into direct competition with traditional generators.</p> <p>While the cumulative goal of Enlightened Energy is huge, the proposed Hydro Quebec contract would also represent a large chunk of electricity for the state, more than the Indian Point 2 reactor provides. At 1,000 megawatts, it could be the largest block of energy added in the state in this decade.</p> <p>Under the contract, the New York Power Authority would sell 200 megawatts to its government customers in southeastern New York, including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Port Authority and the New York City Housing Authority; 482 megawatts to Con Ed, 218 megawatts to the Long Island Lighting Company, and 100 megawatts to Orange and Rockland Utilities. The Public Service Commission began hearings last week on Con Ed&#39;s request for a rate increase, and the role of the proposed contract may come up in testimony this week.</p> <p>The agreement would run for 21 years, beginning in May 1995. Con Ed&#39;s cost would be $6.1 billion. New Savings Estimates</p> <p>Mr. Flynn, the chairman of the Power Authority, once predicted that the contract would save New Yorkers $1 billion. But a spokesman for the authority said last week that with changes since the signing in 1989, that savings estimate was no longer valid, although the savings would still be substantial.</p> <p>The city bases its calculations on the costs and savings for Con Ed, assuming that the findings will hold true for the whole contract. The city estimates that one kilowatt of electricity -- the amount needed to keep 10 100-watt light bulbs burning -- will cost $3,551 through the 21 years of the contract with Hydro Quebec, and $721 through energy savings.</p> <p>Con Edison calculates the cost differently and reaches a different result, with the energy from Hydro Quebec coming out cheaper. But Con Ed does not dispute the city&#39;s method.</p> <p>Last Thursday, the New York State Energy Office, Public Service Commission and Department of Environmental Conservation jointly released a draft of their New York State Energy Master Plan, which said that a new contract with Hydro Quebec could raise rates slightly. Debate on Which Plan Is Cleaner</p> <p>But shunning the contract, the report said, would increase use of coal, natural gas and imported oil, along with emissions of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, nitrogen oxide, which contributes to smog, and carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming.</p> <p>City officials, on the other hand, argue that increased reliance on conservation and independent power producers could be used to sidestep the nagging environmental questions about new dams in northern Quebec, at a price lower than what the Canadian power would cost.</p> <p>Environmental groups have been fighting against the contract. The contract is not tied to any particular project, but would lead Hydro Quebec to build new dams near Hudson Bay to generate the power, flooding the hunting grounds of the Cree Indians.</p> <p>New York first seriously sought hydroelectric power from Canada after the oil shock of 1973-74, and again after the oil shortage of 1979. In recent years as much as 40 percent of the state&#39;s electricity has come from oil, far higher than the national average. But last year, electricity came in almost equal parts from oil, coal, natural gas, hydroelectricity and nuclear reactors. Natural gas use seems poised to increase in coming years, with new pipelines and new constraints on utilities under the Clean Air Act. Nuclear power will not expand in this decade. Hydroelectricity depends in part on rainfall; this year, New York took very little from Canada because of a drought there.</p> <p>Reflecting the changed nature of the utility business, in an interview last week at his office at Con Edison, Mr. Deegan spoke at length about conservation and purchases from other electricity producers. The company began to assemble land on the Hudson River more than a decade ago to build a new generating station of its own some day, but neither Mr. Deegan nor a longtime spokesman for the company, Daniel Walden, could remember at first where the land was. It is in Red Hook.</p> <p>Con Ed&#39;s newest plant, the Indian Point 2 reactor, went into commercial operation 17 years ago this month.</p> <p>Correction:  August 5, 1991, Monday</p> <p>An article yesterday about energy conservation policies of New York State&#39;s utility companies misidentified the New York City Commissioner of Telecommunications and Energy. He is William F. Squadron.</p>
1340233>Security Lapses Close Terminal Federal security agents ordered an American Airlines terminal at Kennedy International Airport evacuated at 4:30 p.m. today after they decided that passengers were not being screened properly, said Laura J. Brown, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration. Seven flights were delayed by more than two hours, Ms. Brown said.  <p>One aviation official said security workers from Worldwide Security, which is a contractor for American, were observed patting down passengers with their hands instead of using metal-detecting wands.</p> <p>On Wednesday night the aviation agency ordered a terminal cleared in Dayton, Ohio, Ms. Brown said, delaying eight flights by two to three hours. This morning, the agency ordered a Southwest Airlines plane in Manchester, N.H., bound for Reagan National Airport in Washington emptied so passengers could be re-screened.</p> <p>The procedure includes clearing all passengers and employees out of the terminal and calling in police officers and dogs to search the terminal and airplanes, Ms. Brown said.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Norman Y. Mineta, the secretary of transportation, said the airlines were not always screening passengers properly, and threatened to have airport terminals cleared and searched, and flights delayed, if performance did not improve. In fact, the aviation agency had done that at least once since the Sept. 11 hijackings. Ms. Brown said the agency had used the procedure five times in the year preceding Sept. 11.</p> <p>A NATION CHALLENGED: AIRPORT SAFETY  Correction:  November 3, 2001, Saturday  An article yesterday about the evacuation of an American Airlines concourse at Kennedy International Airport misidentified the company that was found by the Federal Aviation Administration to be improperly screening passengers there. The company was Worldwide Flight Services Inc., not Worldwide Security.</p>
142414>Oil Prices Decline Almost $1 Oil prices fell sharply yesterday after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries backed away from a proposal to cut production in concert with seven other oil-producing nations.  <p>The prices did not drop to the levels they had reached before the talks were announced. Some analysts and traders said market participants think demand for oil is rising.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;A lot of people think OPEC merely has to keep on its current line and keep cheating at the current level,&#39;&#39; said Salvatore A. Gilbertie, an analyst at Elders Futures Inc., referring to the regularity with which several OPEC members have exceeded their production quotas.</p> <p>Producers and traders appear to be anticipating increased demand because of the summer driving season, followed by a rebuilding of stocks for winter. Pessimism on Prices</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s back to the drawing boards of looking at physical fundamentals, as opposed to politics or psychology,&#39;&#39; said Daniel Yergin of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. But he called yesterday&#39;s drop in prices &#39;&#39;a pretty strong statement about pessimism&#39;&#39; and said the OPEC countries would be under continued pressure to bring more oil to market to keep revenues from dropping.</p> <p>West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, ended the day at $17.15, down 85 cents. Before the announcement on April 9 that OPEC would meet with seven other oil-producing nations, West Texas Intermediate was trading at $16.88. Brent crude oil from the North Sea was trading on the spot market yesterday at $15.90, down from $16.85 on the previous day. On April 8, it was trading at $15.60.</p> <p>Anticipation of an agreement with non-OPEC countries, along with military action in the Persian Gulf, pushed the price of West Texas Intermediate to more than $18.50 last month. Third-Quarter Rise Seen</p> <p>Now, some analysts are looking for stronger prices in the third quarter no matter what the state of agreement among producers.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You can ask yourself a question of what impact on price, if any, do OPEC and non-OPEC attempts to coordinate production cutbacks have,&#39;&#39; said Robert Boslego, an analyst at the Boslego Corporation, in Boston. &#39;&#39;I would argue very little.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But another analyst, Vahan Zanoyan, senior director of the Petroleum Finance Company of Washington, said an important factor to watch now was the posture of the non-OPEC nations in the absence of an agreement. &#39;&#39;Will they go back to the full-capacity production mode?&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;If the signal is that Oman and Mexico don&#39;t say that the deal is off, that there is some level of at least verbal assent, and Lukman says we&#39;re still talking, then it will pre-empt a major price crash,&#39;&#39; Mr. Zanoyan said, referring to Rilwanu Lukman, OPEC&#39;s president. Mexico has been producing at less than capacity and Oman had promised a 5 percent cut.</p> <p>After OPEC ended its meeting in Vienna early yesterday without accepting an offer from the seven other nations to cut production, Mr. Lukman said OPEC would continue consulting with the nonmembers -Egypt, Mexico, Malaysia, Angola, Oman, China and Colombia. An accord was blocked by Saudi Arabia, which insisted that OPEC make no further production cuts because it had borne the brunt of them while non-OPEC nations were increasing output.</p> <p>The sudden drop in oil prices pushed down the prices of oil company stocks. Mobil closed at $46.25, down 50 cents; Chevron at $47.50, down 62.5 cents, Texaco at $49.625, down 50 cents, and Exxon at $44.625, down 25 cents. ARCO closed at $87.25, down $1.375, despite having reported yesterday that first-quarter earnings were $2.20 a share, up from $1.31 a share a year earlier.</p>
1510298>Controller Dispute Threatens F.A.A. Budget A dispute over whether the jobs of about 3,000 air traffic controllers should be contracted out to a private company is threatening the bill that would finance the Federal Aviation Administration for the budget year that begins in eight weeks. The Bush administration has identified control towers at airports not equipped with radar, and controllers who provide weather information but do not direct traffic, as being candidates for &#39;&#39;privatization.&#39;&#39; But after lobbying from the unions that represent the controllers, the House and Senate, in separate bills, voted to block the move.  <p>In response, the administration said the president might veto a bill with such a provision. Just before the House left for its August recess, a conference committee established to reconcile other differences between the House and Senate versions produced a bill that gave the White House its way.</p> <p>Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, the author of the amendment in the Senate version that would have blocked the privatization, said on Friday that the conference report was produced in the &#39;&#39;dark of night&#39;&#39; and that he would fight to defeat the joint version when Congress returned in September. Mr. Lautenberg noted that the conference bill would allow privatization at 69 airport control towers but prohibit it in two in Alaska, the home state of the conference chairman, Representative Don Young, a Republican.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The chairman there is a pretty smart guy, knows transportation very well,&#39;&#39; Mr. Lautenberg said. &#39;&#39;He didn&#39;t want his airports going into public &#39;Acme Air Service.&#39; &#39;&#39;</p> <p>Senator Lautenberg likened the air traffic controllers to &#39;&#39;a fifth branch of the military&#39;&#39; and said their performance on Sept. 11, 2001, when they guided thousands of planes to safe landings, demonstrated that the job was inherently governmental.</p> <p>The F.A.A. argues that it has no plans to contract out the controllers who use radar to separate planes. A clause prohibiting such privatization is &#39;&#39;a cure in search of a disease,&#39;&#39; Marion Blakey, the agency&#39;s administrator, said. Studies show that the controllers who provide weather information do so at a cost of about $15 per briefing, far more than it would cost a private company, she said. About 2,000 such controllers work in flight service stations, aiding private pilots and corporate planes.</p> <p>The F.A.A. also has no immediate plans to privatize the 69 towers, officials say. They add that hundreds of towers already operated under private-sector contracts have an excellent safety record, and cost about half as much to operate as F.A.A. towers and save $54 million annually. There are 219 such towers.</p> <p>John Carr, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents F.A.A. controllers as well as some controllers whose jobs have been privatized, cited figures from a group representing the &#39;&#39;contract towers&#39;&#39; that shows the annual cost per tower was $413,000 this year, up from $273,000 in 1998. The F.A.A. puts the figure at $367,000.</p> <p>Mr. Carr said it was wrong to think of the 69 towers as small. One, in Van Nuys, Calif., is the 8th busiest in the United States; Centennial Airport, near Denver, is the 18th busiest, he said. The towers singled out to be kept in F.A.A. hands are in Juneau and Anchorage.</p> <p>While controllers in those towers do not use radar, he said, many of the planes are guided to their approaches by radar controllers, and go on to use instrument landing systems.</p> <p>The F.A.A. would like the ability to turn the towers over to contractors, said Ms. Blakey, so it can use the tower controllers elsewhere, to fill in for controllers who are retiring. The agency anticipates a wave of retirements of the thousands of controllers hired after the Air Traffic Controllers strike 20 years ago. But Mr. Carr said that most of the controllers in towers worked there because they could not qualify to handle traffic in busier places, or were choosing to work somewhere quieter in their last few years before retirement.</p> <p>During the Clinton administration, the air traffic controllers were classified as &#39;&#39;inherently governmental&#39;&#39; and thus not subject to contracting out. Last year the Bush administration removed that designation.</p>
1319174>A Redesigned Concorde To Resume Flights Soon WITH a new kind of tires, a change in wiring, bulletproof fuel tanks and a redecorated cabin, the Concorde will resume service in September or October, according to British Airways and Air France. Air France stopped flying the supersonic plane immediately after the crash last summer that killed 109 passengers and crew and 4 people on the ground; British Airways stopped three weeks later.  <p>Airline officials say they are making three changes, any one of which would have prevented the crash in Paris, and that the 13 remaining planes should serve at least through the end of this decade. Although the planes, which began commercial service in 1976, are old in years, they have relatively few hours of flying and few landings and takeoffs, most completing no more than two flights a day, if that.</p> <p>The French government may still be months from issuing a final report on the crash, but Capt. Michael Bannister, British Airways&#39; chief Concorde pilot, who on July 17 conducted the first supersonic test flight of the modified Concorde, said, &#39;&#39;Every new piece of information that has come along has only underlined that our modifications are in the right area.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Investigators give this account of the July 25, 2000, crash:</p> <p>During its takeoff roll, the plane hit debris on the runway and one of its tires shed a piece of tread weighing at least 10 pounds. This slapped the underside of the wing, creating a shock wave in the fuel inside. The fuel bounced inside the tank and punched out a section of the underside of the wing, inducing a massive fuel leak, more than 20 gallons a second. Atomized by the wind, the fuel was probably ignited by a spark from wiring in the wheel well, which may also have been damaged by the shredded tire.</p> <p>Information compiled by French investigators on tire performance makes the crash seem unsurprising. In the small fleet (only 16 aircraft were ever delivered to the airlines, the last in 1979) there were 57 tire bursts or deflations, of which 12 had &#39;&#39;structural consequences on the wings and/or the tanks, of which six led to penetration of the tanks,&#39;&#39; according to a report released in December by the B.E.A. (Bureau Enquêtes-Accidents), a French government agency. Nineteen of these incidents were caused by foreign objects, and 22 were on takeoff.</p> <p>At the time of the crash, the Concorde was experiencing a tire burst or deflation approximately once every 1,500 flights, compared with once every 100,000 flights on the Airbus A340, a conventional long-haul aircraft, the investigators said.</p> <p>Then, the Concorde was equipped with bias-ply tires; now it has Michelin radials of a new type, called Near-Zero Growth, because when they are inflated they are only about 2 percent larger than when they have no gas inside. The idea is to put less strain on the tread. In addition, the tread has been reinforced with a material like the fabric used in bulletproof vests.</p> <p>Like many planes, the Concorde carries its fuel inside the wing, with the underside of the wing serving as the bottom of the fuel tank. That piece of metal has now been lined, on the inside, with Kevlar to prevent ruptures, as is done in military aircraft.</p> <p>And the wiring has been protected, Captain Bannister said. In addition, the only high-voltage circuit, which provides electricity to fans that cool the wheels after takeoff, will be switched off.</p> <p>Changes in aircraft are complicated. The Concorde uses its fuel to run the engines and to conduct heat away from the wings, which heat up at supersonic speeds. One purpose of the test flights was to see if the Kevlar would interfere with heat transfer, and if it would increase the amount of fuel that forms unusable pools in the tank. Neither was a problem, Captain Bannister said.</p> <p>The changes added about 1,200 pounds to the aircraft&#39;s weight, a substantial penalty, but Captain Bannister said that the new cabin interior weighed 700 pounds less, and each of the eight tires weighed 44 pounds  less, so the total weight did not change appreciably.</p> <p>The Concordes are a tiny portion of the fleets of British Airways and Air France but showpieces nonetheless. The British Airways Web site, still advertising the plane despite a hiatus of a year, calls it the &#39;&#39;ultimate travel experience.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Once regulators in Europe are persuaded that the modifications have solved the problems, the airlines will complete work on their Concordes gradually, and introduce service as more planes become available. Captain Bannister said that charter flights would be the last to be added back.</p> <p>TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT&#39;S REPORT</p>
857091>Air Force Cites Command Failures in Brown Crash A sustained breakdown in the Air Force&#39;s chain of command was a leading factor in the plane crash that killed Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and all 34 other people aboard in Dubrovnik, Croatia, two months ago, the service said today in its official report on the accident. It was as a result of this breakdown, the report said, that Air Force commanders in Europe had failed to require a safety inspection at the Dubrovnik  airport whose outcome might have prevented the crash.  <p>The report concluded, as previously published news accounts had suggested it would, that pilot error and insufficient on-board navigational equipment had also contributed to the accident. And it said landing procedures laid out by the Croatian aviation authorities had allowed the plane, which crashed into a mountain adjacent to the airport, to approach from an altitude that was too low  for safety.</p> <p>But, it said, the poor weather in Dubrovnik at the time was not sufficiently  bad to be a significant factor, and all systems on the aircraft were working well. Also working, the report said, were both radio-beacon systems on the ground at Dubrovnik, contrary to suspicions raised by Defense Secretary William  J. Perry in a talk with reporters on Thursday.</p> <p>The report further concluded that contrary to an earlier account by a longtime friend and business associate of Secretary Brown, it was unlikely that  he had pressured the flight crew to fly into Dubrovnik in bad weather. The same  officers, the report said, had resisted such pressure on an earlier flight carrying high Government officials.</p> <p>The report, which with supporting documents amounts to more than 7,000 pages, did not rank the causes of the crash by significance. But General Ronald R. Fogleman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, said at a Pentagon briefing for reporters that the most troubling problem was the breakdown in the chain of command, or what the report called &quot;management complacency and inadequate oversight.&quot;</p> <p>The report said Brig. Gen. William E. Stevens, commander of the German-based  86th Airlift Wing, to which the jet belonged, had directly contradicted an order issued months earlier by superiors in Washington to require a check of the safety design of previously unchecked European airports, like Dubrovnik&#39;s, into  which his planes were flying.</p> <p>General Stevens and two deputies were relieved of their duties soon after the crash and, officials said today, may face court-martial.</p> <p>&quot;The biggest question that I have from my level is how could we have an Air Force instruction in the field that was not being complied with at the major air-command level,&quot; General Fogleman said. &quot;I need to find the answer to that. In my view, that&#39;s the start of this chain of events.&quot;</p> <p>Much of the investigation&#39;s most damning findings are contained not in the 73-page central report but in the thousands of pages of documentary evidence and deposition transcripts.</p> <p>Perhaps the most explosive deposition taken by the investigators came from Lieut. Col. James A. Albright, former commander of the squadron to which the doomed plane belonged.</p> <p>In his testimony, Colonel Albright described an atmosphere in which safety concerns may sometimes have been secondary to on-time performance, and in which  pilots were required to fly jets with outdated equipment into airports that offered only the most primitive navigational aids.</p> <p>Powerful Government officials and their staffs, Colonel Albright said, often  demanded that Air Force planes on which they traveled fly through dangerous weather or to airports with poor navigational equipment.</p> <p>&quot;I think there is an atmosphere of fear,&quot; said Colonel Albright, who was removed from his command five days before the crash because of differences with General Stevens, his superior. &quot;In the matrix of safety versus mission, Stevens is mission first.&quot;</p> <p>Colonel Albright also said that Maj. Gen. Charles R. Heflebower, the commander of the 17th Air Force, the parent command of General Stevens&#39;s 86th Airlift Wing, had a &quot;reputation for intimidation and pushing pilots to do things that are blatantly illegal&quot; from a safety standpoint and that General Heflebower himself had made illegal and potentially dangerous maneuvers while flying Air Force planes.</p> <p>In their own depositions, both General Heflebower and General Stevens denied  Colonel Albright&#39;s accusations.</p> <p>Asked whether pilots under his command had ever voiced concern about his policies, General Heflebower replied, &quot;I not only don&#39;t recall it, it didn&#39;t happen.&quot;</p> <p>General Stevens, questioned closely by investigators, said safety had been his first priority. But he also said that to do its work, his unit had badly needed a waiver from the airport-inspection directive issued in Washington, so that his pilots could instead continue using existing, commercially available data on airport approaches.</p> <p>The 86th Airlift Wing&#39;s request for such a waiver was denied at the beginning of the year. But General Stevens said that he had delegated the matter to a subordinate and that &quot;however we were flying&quot; the approaches, &quot;I expected us to  do it legally.&quot;</p> <p>Full details of the ill-fated flight&#39;s last few minutes can never be known, because the plane, a military version of the Boeing 737 that the Air Force used  for carrying &quot;distinguished visitors,&quot; was not equipped with a cockpit voice recorder or a flight data recorder, as is required on commercial planes.</p> <p>But, citing radar data, engineering studies, air-traffic-control audiotapes and evidence from the wreckage, the report paints a picture of a hectic last few minutes in which the pilots, trying to land at an airport where they had never been before, began the approach too fast and without the landing gear or the flaps configured for landing.</p> <p>The crew, also busy talking to the airport tower and to a pilot on the ground, somehow set a course that was six degrees off, a heading that carried the plane into the mountain.</p> <p>The report said there were several reasons why the crew should not have attempted the approach.</p> <p>For one, the approach required tuning in to two radio beacons on the ground,  10 miles apart, and the plane carried only one instrument for doing so.</p> <p>After the crash, other pilots from the plane&#39;s squadron told investigators that it would have been possible to make the approach with the single radio receiver, by re-tuning it to the frequency of the second radio beacon after flying past the first one. But doing so would have been a violation of Air Force rules.</p> <p>The report did not go into great detail on why the plane had been so poorly equipped to begin with.</p> <p>In any case, the investigators have determined from the wreckage that the pilots, Capt. Ashley J. Davis and Capt. Timothy W. Shafer, never tuned to the second beacon, which marks the spot at which a pilot must either see the runway  or climb and turn away from the mountain. The plane crashed about a mile, or 30  seconds, farther along.</p> <p>Officials also said the pilots had been running late because they had mistakenly developed a flight plan from Tuzla, Bosnia, to Dubrovnik that would have carried them outside NATO-approved flight corridors, and as a result had been redirected by air traffic controllers.</p> <p>On approach to Dubrovnik, they crossed the first beacon too fast, without clearance from the tower at the airport and before they had the landing gear and the flaps in place for landing, possibly because they were in a rush, the officials said.</p> <p>The Air Force report blamed the Croatian Government for the design of the approach. But the assistant minister of the Civil Aviation Department in Croatia said that the approach met international standards and that he had confirmed this with the International Civil Aviation Organization, to which both Croatia and the United States belong.</p> <p>At issue is a requirement in the published approach instructions called the &quot;minimum descent altitude,&quot; the lowest altitude at which a plane is allowed to fly before the pilots can see a clear path to the runway. For Dubrovnik&#39;s runway 12, which the pilots were trying to use, Croatia specifies 2,150 feet. But just  off the runway to the left is the mountain, St. John the Baptist, which rises to 2,300 feet; the plane hit it at 2,175.</p> <p>The report, produced by the Air Force with help from two civilian agencies -- the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board -- concluded that Croatia had applied the wrong formula to calculate the minimum altitude and that it should have been at least 2,592 feet.</p> <p>From that altitude, though, jets like the one that crashed would be unable to descend safely from the decision point to the runway&#39;s end, a distance of 1.9 nautical miles, according to aviation experts.</p> <p>And Jure Kapetanovic, who headed Croatia&#39;s own investigation of the crash, said in a telephone interview that he had confirmed with the International Civil Aviation Organization that 2,150 feet met its criteria.</p> <p>In Montreal, where the organization is based, Eric MacBurnie, a spokesman, said the agency did not issue approval for approaches and instead merely provided guidance to member states. He said the organization had confirmed to Mr. Kapetanovic only that Croatia had used the aviation organization&#39;s guidance  in developing the approach.</p> <p>Regardless of whether the published approach meets international standards, it does not meet the Pentagon&#39;s. The Air Force decided in November 1994 that it  should check all published approaches to make sure they conformed to its own standards, a job that takes about six hours per approach. But the service never  got around to this one.</p> <p>According to a chronology issued today, the 86th Airlift Wing, based in Ramstein, Germany, asked for a waiver last November so that commanders there would not have to analyze all the airports that their planes flew into, many of  which, in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, were just opening up to American military traffic.</p> <p>The Air Force denied the waiver on Jan. 2, a decision that the report says was made known to the Ramstein officers on Jan. 23.</p> <p>But, facing a steep increase in their workload with the end of the cold war and a larger number of visits by American officials to airports behind the former Iron Curtain, the commanders kept flying their planes as before, using charts published by Jeppesen Standard, a commercial company that gathers data from national aviation authorities and sells that data to airlines, private pilots and anyone else who asks.</p> <p>According to Brig. Gen. Charles H. Coolidge Jr., the president of the Air Force board that investigated the crash, at the time of the accident the service did not even train its pilots in how to read the Jeppesen charts, which differ from Air Force charts in many details.</p>
417674>The World; Experts Say Oil Shocks Are Unlikely To Go Away THE oil price fever that has burned since August -- the industrial world&#39;s third bout with the malady since 1973 -- was broken last week when traders concluded that the intense air raids on Iraq had eliminated the threat to Saudi installations. The price of crude fell by more than $10 overnight and ended the week at a level lower than before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. No one is sure what will happen to prices in the weeks ahead. Government officials went to great pains to argue that this was not a case, as demonstrators keep chanting, of &quot;blood for oil.&quot; But attention inevitably turned to techniques other than carpet bombing for assuring access to oil or, better yet, reducing the economy&#39;s dependence on a commodity that can jump in price by 150 percent in a few weeks, and fall by 33 percent in a few hours.  <p>The case for making the world safe for oil-importing countries is clear, said Joseph Stanislaw, a Paris-based oil expert for Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Even if Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait never marched on to Saudi Arabia, &quot;the intimidation would have been enough to have given them effective control of OPEC pricing,&quot; he said, &quot;putting not only the American economy, but the industrialized world, at the mercy of one man.&quot;</p> <p>No matter how successful the war against Mr. Hussein, however, energy security will be far from assured. The American oil industry would like to produce more at home. But when it comes to oil, geology is destiny. The United States has about 26 billion barrels of proven reserves in the ground, of a global total of one trillion barrels. And the oil is getting harder to find; since the oil price crash of 1986, domestic daily oil production has shrunk by an amount larger than Kuwait&#39;s normal production.</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s clear that U.S. production of those reserves will have a very limited impact on the world oil market,&quot; said Robert K. Watson, an energy specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has fought hard against drilling in parts of Alaska and the outer continental shelf. The reason is the volume elsewhere, including 650 billion barrels in the Persian Gulf. Iraq and Kuwait each have roughly quadruple the reserves of the United States; Saudi Arabia&#39;s are 10 times larger.</p> <p>But the United States is an oil giant of another kind; last year it consumed 16.96 million barrels a day, or about 28 percent of world production. So the country is addicted to imports, 46 percent of supply last year. After the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, industry and consumers switched to other fuels or simply used less. Americans used .27 metric tons of oil per $1,000 in gross domestic product in 1970, but by 1989 the figure was down to .18 tons, a drop of 33 percent. In the same period, Japan improved by 46 percent.</p> <p>With domestic production declining 5 percent last year and probably more this year if low prices prevail, the United States will have to run hard just to stay in place in terms of imports. That means, said Mr. Watson and others, &quot;the only way we can really affect the amount of oil available to provide energy services is by getting a handle on demand.&quot;</p> <p>The United States has been at a disadvantage in weaning itself from oil, partly because it relies on market forces, which do not reflect the cost of war. Despite three oil shocks, oil is still easy to find, cheap to buy, and easy to use. Oil may be depletable in theory, but because of exploration and better technology reserves have nearly doubled since 1970. And, fever aside, the price is usually low. Cambridge Energy Research Associates calculates that prices in 1989 were one-fourth lower than in 1980, adjusting for inflation, and the price has stayed consistently below the price of oil from shale or tar sands.</p> <p>Supply is a prominent issue when it is threatened, but almost always, moving oil is very easy. It generally does not require long pipelines, as does natural gas, and when refined and delivered for use it is an extremely compact energy package. Two efficiency experts, Amory B. Lovins and Hunter B. Lovins, calculated in their book &quot;Brittle Power&quot; that a gasoline station with 20 pumps running is delivering as much energy as a medium-sized nuclear plant.</p> <p>For months, the Energy Department has been developing a National Energy Strategy, presenting the White House with a menu of steps to increase supply or cut demand. But experts outside government think the former is more likely.</p> <p>The chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, Michael R. Deland, said, &quot;It will be extremely difficult to lessen our dependence on imported -- and hence Middle Eastern -- oil.&quot; The economy can switch to other technologies, but the most important will not be in wide commercial use until the next century, he said. A new generation of more economical, publicly acceptable nuclear power plants, photovoltaic cells and other &quot;renewable&quot; energy sources, including batteries to run vehicles, will be needed, he said, along with a general improvement in efficiency.</p> <p>At Citizen Action, a Washington-based nonprofit group, Ed Rothschild, an energy expert, called for a plan stressing efficiency. But he added, &quot;The decline in oil prices may have a perverse effect, taking the pressure off to have a national energy strategy.&quot;</p> <p>Others argue that no energy strategy is good energy strategy. Fereidun Fesharaki, an oil analyst at the East-West Center, a research center in Honolulu, defined energy policy as &quot;taking my tax dollars and subsidizing something uneconomic.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It creates industries which do not deserve to be created,&quot; he said, referring to synthetic fuels and other failed efforts. When oil rises in price, he said, alternatives will emerge on their own.</p> <p>In the meantime, he suggested, events like Iraq&#39;s invasion of Kuwait or other triggers for oil shocks are &quot;something we may face every 10 or 15 years.&quot;</p>
428711>Lower Oil Prices Thwart U.S. Energy Goal The next few months are beginning to look like a very difficult time to form a national policy for becoming less dependent on imported oil. The Persian Gulf war and the sharp rise in oil prices that followed its onset in August reminded everyone of the large and growing American reliance on imported oil. But the end of the war has brought a seemingly contrary signal: lower prices.  <p>Indeed, the price of oil today -- about $19 a barrel -- is lower than it was when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. And many analysts think it will soon be lower than when the Iraqi President made his first hostile noises in the middle of July, when oil was in the high teens.</p> <p>To instill the need to conserve despite the plummeting prices, the Government could issue edicts, like ordering Detroit to make cars that use less gasoline, or raise oil prices artificially by adding new taxes or import duties. But the National Energy Strategy released by the Bush Administration two weeks ago relies instead on removing constraints from production and largely counts on the marketplace to induce conservation.</p> <p>Relying on the market to tell the country to use less is a tough path right now, say some analysts who would like to take stronger steps. &quot;We have gone to war in the Middle East largely over oil,&quot; Jack Riggs, staff director of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said at a Washington seminar last week at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. &quot;But the price of oil is expected to go down, and the public may very well tell us not to do anything controversial.&quot;</p> <p>With the price of oil about where it was last Aug. 1, and even with the 5-cent-a-gallon increase in the Federal gasoline tax imposed in December, drivers are enjoying historic bargains.</p> <p>&quot;The price of gasoline in America has never been cheaper in real terms,&quot; Robert B. Horton, chairman of the British Petroleum Company, said in a speech in Washington last week at a meeting on oil and national security organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p> <p>He stressed that the price of gasoline was too low now to support the refining of new, lower-polluting reformulated gasolines. &quot;Beer costs about three times as much per gallon, is largely water, and certainly isn&#39;t the product of technical miracles,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Nearly every other industrial country -- even Britain, an oil exporter -- puts stiff taxes on fuel. But raising taxes in the United States would be politically difficult, Mr. Horton said, even after years of seeking greater oil self-sufficiency and realizing the opposite. More than 60 percent of United States oil needs are for transportation, and nearly half the oil America uses is imported.  Tax Was Rejected</p> <p>Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said in an address to the same group that an energy tax in the National Energy Strategy had been considered and rejected.</p> <p>&quot;We know what the response of the American public will be, and it&#39;s not attractive,&quot; he said. &quot;They really do believe the bill of rights gave them unleaded regular for $1.06 a gallon, and they better get it or, by God, they&#39;ll get the bums out of office.&quot;</p> <p>Proposing a tax on Capitol Hill is useless, he said. &quot;It simply won&#39;t get through. People want to get elected again.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Watkins had told Congress previously that a mandatory increase in fuel economy standards for cars, which the Administration opposes, would be of relatively little value because average mileage would rise anyway, as shoppers chose leaner cars as fuel prices increased. But in the years since the oil price collapse of 1986, the average fuel economy of new cars has declined, with buyers given little financial incentive to choose more efficient cars.</p> <p>To be a useful signal to the market, any fuel-price increase would have to be large, many people think. Amory Lovins, the physicist and efficiency expert, pointed out that because of the expense of buying, insuring and maintaining a car, the cost of fuel is only one-quarter the cost of driving a mile. Meanwhile, mileage is now high enough -- about 20 miles a gallon for the average car on the road -- that the price signal is smaller yet.</p> <p>The consensus in Washington, including among those who drafted the President&#39;s energy strategy, is that the price of gasoline and the signal it sends to consumers fail to incorporate what economists call &quot;externalities,&quot; or costs to society. In the case of the Persian Gulf war, for example, the costs of deploying troops, of cleaning up pollution and of living without the use of polluted land or water are externalities that add to the ultimate cost of oil.</p> <p>Peter D. Blair, the energy and materials program manager in the Office of Technology Assessment, a Congressional agency, said he had heard estimates of the externalities ranging from 0 to $382 a barrel, or up to $9 for each gallon of oil.</p> <p>But he said there was no clear way to quantify in dollars the national security impact of dependence on oil imports. &quot;That means the policy goal has to come from elsewhere,&quot; he said, suggesting that Congress might set a national security goal, like a ceiling on imports, and set a tax to achieve that.</p> <p>Still, with the large amount of oil used in this country -- about 215 billion gallons a year -- the added costs of the gulf war will probably have little impact. If the deployment cost $60 billion -- assigning no value to the loss of life -- and could be said to have assured lower prices for five years, the extra cost over that period would add a little over 5 cents to a gallon of oil.</p> <p>In fact, because contributions from the allied nations are expect to meet, or even exceed, the cost of the war, the conflict may add less, or nothing at all, to the United States&#39; oil bill.</p>
415621>Questions Arise on Methods Of Filtering Ultraviolet Light After the patient had picked out new frames, he thought that was the last step in shopping for new glasses, but then the optometrist asked, &quot;Do you want the ultraviolet coating?&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; asked the patient. &quot;Well,&quot; said the optometrist, &quot;you work at a computer, don&#39;t you?&quot;  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the patient.</p> <p>&quot;Then do you want the ultraviolet coating?&quot;</p> <p>That conversation, with variations, is probably repeated thousands of times a day, with its implication that ultraviolet light is a hazard, that it is produced by computer screens and that coated, ultraviolet-absorptive lenses will protect the wearer. Many people who wear glasses, unsure of what they need and of the value of the coating, play it safe and pay $10 or more to have it applied.</p> <p>Buyers often take the anti-glare coating, too. Both coatings are a source of profit in the increasingly competitive field of selling glasses, but some doubts have been expressed whether either coating provides the benefit often described. From Screens, Insignificant</p> <p>For example, computer screens do not emit significant amounts of ultraviolet light, according to computer specialists, Government scientists, physicists and other experts. And neither do television screens.</p> <p>Dr. Donald G. Pitts, a professor at the College of Optometry at the University of Houston, said the emissions from a computer screen are one ten-thousandth of the level believed to cause problems. &quot;There&#39;s more UV coming out of the fluorescent lights overhead,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But even among ophthalmologists, whose specialty is the eye and its diseases, there is a lack of consensus over whether the coatings are desirable for ordinary eyeglasses.</p> <p>The Federal Government asks strict labeling of sunglasses to learn what fraction of the ultraviolet light is filtered out. There are separate measurements for two types of ultraviolet light: UVA, which causes skin to tan, and UVB, which causes sunburn, blistering and skin cancer. The Government has no standards for ordinary glasses.</p> <p>Dr. Michael F. Marmor, chairman of the ophthalmology department at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said experiments with animals and with human tissue had led physicians to suspect that ultraviolet light causes cataracts and retina damage. &quot;The problem is that there is no good epidemiological evidence in man that UV light is a serious risk factor,&quot; he said. &quot;There is certainly no evidence that UV is useful to us&quot; and if the glasses are to be used outdoors, &quot;there is a good rationale for UV protection.&quot;</p> <p>But instead of a coating, which can wear off, he recommended that the patient ask specifically for good ultraviolet-absorptive lenses, and that it would be best to consult an eye doctor first. At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the chairman of the ophthalmology department, Dr. David E. Eifrig, said, &quot;If you wear plastic lenses of any kind, 95 percent of the UV will be blocked.&quot;</p> <p>Dr. Eifrig is a member of a committee on ophthalmic devices of the American National Standards Institute, a private group that sets voluntary performance standards for consumer and industrial products. He said that while buying the ultraviolet coating would not hurt, &quot;I&#39;m here to protect the poor people of the world from getting taken or thinking they need something they don&#39;t need.&quot; Plastic lenses alone are &quot;more than adequate,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Dr. Marmor of Stanford advised that when shopping for protective glasses, especially sunglasses, the consumer should look for glasses that filter out all UVA and UVB light. The institute&#39;s standards, he said, were &quot;largely written by sunglass manufacturers&quot; and are not high enough.</p> <p>For his part, Dr. Eifrig said, &quot;There is really no evidence that the ANSI standards are not sufficient,&quot; referring to the institute.</p> <p>Linda Whitfield, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said that both Dr. Marmor and Dr. Eifrig are regarded as leading experts in the field. There is agreement in one area: Indoors, ultraviolet light is not a big concern.</p> <p>Along with the ultraviolet-absorptive coating, patients buying prescription lenses may also be asked if they want an anti-glare, or anti-reflective, coating. Manufacturers of glasses sometimes say that that coating will reduce the glare from a computer screen or other work surface, but Floyd H. Holmgrain Jr., the executive director of the National Academy of Opticianry, said the anti-reflective coating merely reduced the amount of light that bounces off the lenses without reaching the wearer.  In untreated plastic lenses, only 5 percent of the light bounces back.</p> <p>The coating, which is $10 or more, will make the lenses less obvious -- say, if the person wears thick lenses -- and thus can serve a cosmetic purpose, Mr. Holmgrain said. But it will not help the wearer to see any better. If glare from a computer terminal&#39;s screen is a problem, specialists said, the solution is to change the lighting in the room or put an anti-glare panel on the screen. In Favor of Sunglasses</p> <p>Plastic lenses are now much more common than glass, mostly because they are lighter. They are virtually unbreakable, but one type of plastic, polycarbonate, scratches easily. Sellers of such lenses usually offer a scratch-resistant coating for about $10. &quot;If you are getting a polycarbonate lens, scratch resistance is necessary, period,&quot; said Dr. Pitts of the University of Houston. &quot;Some coatings make the plastic almost as hard as glass.&quot;</p> <p>For extended outdoor use, particularly in snow and at the beach, experts favor sunglasses, even for people with 20-20 vision. In a study two years ago, Consumer Reports found that all of the more than 150 models of sunglasses provided adequate protection from ultraviolet light. The glasses ranged in price from $2 to $145. Big lenses or wraparound-style glasses will allow less light to enter around the frames. A hat can help, too.</p>
284689>Tentative Agreement on Rocky Flats Cleanup Federal and state negotiators have reached a tentative agreement that would limit Federal officials&#39; liability for their handling of hazardous waste at the Government&#39;s Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in Colorado, an official involved in the talks said yesterday.  <p>But the agreement has not yet been accepted by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, whose department owns the plant. And the provisions on immunity do not cover the operator, the Rockwell International Corporation, which has threatened to shut Rocky Flats unless it receives immunity from prosecution. Rockwell was invited to join the negotiations but declined, the official said.</p> <p>The agreement calls for safe storage of the wastes, steps to reduce production of waste and prompt action by the Energy Department to build treatment plants. It would exempt Federal officials from civil liability for their handling of wastes in the future, but not for past violations or for criminal violations. Silence From Rockwell</p> <p>The plant, just outside Denver, is the Government&#39;s only source of plutonium triggers for thermonuclear bombs. For years it has been producing liquid chemical wastes, laced with radioactive materials, for which there is no disposal system. A 1984 law bans burial of the wastes unless they are treated, or storage of some of them for more than 90 days.</p> <p>The Energy Department had contended for years that the law did not cover Federal plants.</p> <p>Rockwell has maintained silence about the negotiations. A company spokesman in Denver was quoted by local reporters as saying Thursday Rockwell might shut the plant if no agreement was reached, but the spokesman, Dennis Hurtt, refused on Friday to confirm the statement, referring all calls to the company&#39;s headquarters in Los Angeles. Public relations executives there said at first that they would have a statement at the end of the day, but then said they would have none. Yesterday, Rockwell&#39;s public relations offices in Denver and Los Angeles were closed.</p> <p>Criminal violations, if any, would involve actions like intentionally violating the law and knowingly creating dangerous situations. One criminal investigation is under way. Since June, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Environmental Protection Agency, armed with a search warrant, have been investigating allegations that plant workers surreptitiously dumped liquid wastes into a pond that empties into a public reservoir, and operated an incinerator that they had announced was closed for safety reasons.</p> <p>At the Energy Department, Will Callicott, a spokesman, said on Saturday, &#39;&#39;We, the state and the Environmental Protection Agency met into the night yesterday, but there is nothing that the Department of Energy would characterize even as a tentative agreement.&#39;&#39; Briefing for Watkins</p> <p>He said the question had not yet been put to the Secretary, adding, &#39;&#39;We are not in a position to say we&#39;ve reached an agreement until Admiral Watkins says we&#39;ve reached agreement.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>He said Mr. Watkins would be briefed this week, probably on Monday.</p> <p>One official at the department said the staff had not yet decided what action to advise Mr. Watkins to take on the proposed agreement.</p> <p>Complicating the negotiations is that there is no place licensed to accept the wastes. At one time the department had planned to burn them in a special incinerator, but that incinerator caught fire in a test.</p> <p>The wastes are only part of the problem at Rocky Flats, which is also accumulating plutonium-contaminated solids, for which there is no long-term disposal site. Those wastes are being shipped to the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, near Idaho Falls, but Gov. Cecil D. Andrus of that state is threatening to bar those shipments.</p>
24182>U.S. WILL CUT POWER AT BOMB FUEL REACTORS AMID CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY The Department of Energy said yesterday that it would cut power sharply at its three operating plutonium-producing reactors because of concern that the reactors&#39; emergency cooling systems could not handle an accident.  <p>The announcement means large additional cuts in the Government&#39;s ability to make bomb fuel at the Savannah River complex near Aiken, S.C. Late last year the department cut power by about 26 percent. The three plants will now operate at less than half the power level at which they were running at last year.</p> <p>The action came amid questions by critics of the department about the candor of high department officials in recent Congressional testimony on the safety of the reactors. Questions have also been raised about the department&#39;s response to outside advice and its ability to determine a safe level of operation. Reviewed After Soviet Accident</p> <p>The National Academy of Sciences, called in by the department after the accident last April at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the Soviet Union, said in a March 9 letter that it was &#39;&#39;unable to conclude with confidence&#39;&#39; that the Savannah River reactors could survive an accident without major damage. Yesterday, a few hours after the letter became public, the department announced it would cut power at the reactors by 33 percent to 45 percent.</p> <p>But the Under Secretary of Energy, Joseph F. Salgado, said the timing of the action had nothing to do with publicity. Rather, he said it was based on how long it took to determine the proper course. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ll tell God and country under oath, we&#39;ve done this one right,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>As the department was making its announcement, Senator John Glenn, whose Governmental Affairs Committee has for weeks been investigating the safety of the government&#39;s bomb fuel reactors, said that continued operation at the existing power level &#39;&#39;borders on an emergency situation.&#39;&#39; An Error in 1979</p> <p>Safety experts fear that if a pipe break allowed the cooling water to boil away, the reactor&#39;s fuel would melt and its radioactivity would be released to the environment. Because the complex is operated by the Department of Energy, it is not regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as civilian plants are, and thus does not have as extensive an emergency plan for the surrounding area as do civilian plants.</p> <p>Power at the Savannah River plants was cut by about a fourth last November and December after E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., the contractor that operates the reactors, discovered that it had made an error in 1979 in measuring the effectiveness of the emergency core cooling system.</p> <p>A fourth plant at Savannah River has been shut down indefinitely since mid-1985 because of a crack in the reactor containment. Another government plant, the N-Reactor in Hanford, Wash., was shut down in January for six months to make safety improvements.</p> <p>Since November the Energy Department has been studying the effectiveness of the emergency core cooling system. It had not reached a conclusion when the National Academy of Sciences wrote on what it called a matter of &#39;&#39;immediate concern.&#39;&#39; The letter was released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a non-profit environmental group based in Washington. &#39;Troubling Lack of Candor&#39;</p> <p>The November power cut was disclosed on March 12 by officials of the General Accounting Office in testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. Although the Department had the academy&#39;s letter at that time, and responded to it in writing that day, Mary L. Walker, the department&#39;s Assistant Secretary for Environmental Safety and Health, did not mention the continuing safety concern over the power level when she testified.</p> <p>In an appendix to her prepared testimony, she said that Du Pont was &#39;&#39;actively examining&#39;&#39; the capacity of the emergency core cooling system, and that &#39;&#39;various options for improving capacity are under consideration.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Natural Resources Defense Council, a frequent critic of the department&#39;s operations, complained in a letter to Senator Glenn, chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, that Ms. Walker had shown a &#39;&#39;troubling lack of candor on a safety matter of such grave concern.&#39;&#39; Independent Oversight Urged</p> <p>Senator Glenn, in a prepared statement released yesterday evening, said: &#39;&#39;I do now know whether this was an error of ommission or commission, but in either case it is evident that outside, independent oversight of health and safety at Department of Energy nuclear sites is imperative.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The academy&#39;s letter, signed by Richard A. Meserve, chairman of the Committee to Assess Safety and Technical Issues at D.O.E. Reactors, said &#39;&#39;we are not able to conclude with confidence that significant core damage would be avoided if there were a severe loss of coolant accident while the reactors are operating at currently established power limits. In our view, the reactors should only be operated at power levels at which it can be convincingly demonstrated that there will be adequate cooling of the fuel&#39;&#39; during an malfunction.</p> <p>Delbert Bunch, the deputy assistant secretary for Safety, Health and Quality Assurance, said that after his department received the academy&#39;s letter on March 11, it requested a briefing, which the academy could not provide until March 18.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;During the course of that briefing it became clear that they were not satisfied with the level of confidence in the experimental and analytical programs that had been done at Du Pont,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>He added that the likelihood of an accident that would require use of the emergency core cooling system was very small. As a result, he said, the department did not think it necessary to shut the reactors until a power level could be determined that would bring a satisfactory &#39;&#39;level of confidence&#39;&#39; in safety.</p>
150133>Next Problem: No Place to Send Its Tainted Fuel New York State intends to dismantle the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station, but Shoreham will probably still stand well into the next century, experts say, because there is no place to dispose of its radioactive fuel rods and reactor parts.  <p>The plant cannot be cut up and hauled away until its fuel, which has been made more radioactive by months of low-level test operation, is removed from the site, and the United States has no disposal centers for the spent fuel of any utility&#39;s reactor.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There really is no place for spent fuel right now,&#39;&#39; said Keith G. Steyer, a specialist in decommissioning at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. &#39;Mothballing&#39; a Plant</p> <p>The Federal Department of Energy has promised to begin accepting such fuel in the late 1990&#39;s, but there are indications that it will miss the deadline. Even when a repository opens, Shoreham is likely to be assigned a lower priority than operating plants that will need to get rid of their used fuel if they are to keep running.</p> <p>Shoreham&#39;s fuel could be removed from the reactor vessel and kept in an adjacent storage pool, but even there it will require continuous monitoring and protection. &#39;&#39;Until that is removed, you can&#39;t really have a decommissioning,&#39;&#39; Mr. Steyer said.  But &#39;&#39;mothballing&#39;&#39; the standing plant - storing it in a way that would allow it to be used if future circumstances warranted - would be very difficult, according to many experts. No American plant has been mothballed.</p> <p>Owners of nuclear plants typically spend tens of millions of dollars a year to meet new Federal safety requirements. A plant mothballed 10 years ago, for example, would now face extensive changes to reflect lessons learned from the fire at the Browns Ferry (Ala.) nuclear plant in 1975 and the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979.</p> <p>In addition, the cost of protecting the plant, staffing the control room and carrying out the testing needed to maintain a license would be substantial. Even the license itself is expensive: more than $900,000 a year for a plant the size of Shoreham.</p> <p>The staffing levels specified in the license, including the continuous presence of several licensed operators in the control room and guards around the plant, would be significantly eased if the fuel were taken out of the reactor, and Shoreham were granted a &#39;&#39;possession only&#39;&#39; license for its nuclear material. Currently, it holds a testing license from the regulatory agency.</p> <p>Also uncertain is where the reactor vessel and other parts contaminated with radiation would be buried. Most radioactive waste from New York State is trucked now to a commercial disposal center near Aiken, S.C., but by national agreement, that is scheduled to be closed to material from outside the Southeast in a few years.</p> <p>New York State has yet to select its own site for low-level waste. Before such a site could open, industry experts expect a lengthy period of study and political debate, licensing hearings and construction.</p> <p>Even if there were disposal sites for Shoreham&#39;s fuel and contaminated parts, the cost and safety of decommissioning a nuclear reactor are a matter of uncertainty and debate. Nuclear power is still a young industry, and no plant approaching the size of Shoreham has been decommissioned. Unknown Factors</p> <p>The owners of several retired plants have decided to let them sit for extended periods, up to 30 years, at which time radiation levels will be lower.</p> <p>The heart of the problem at Shoreham is that an operating nuclear plant produces radioactivity. Like asbestos or PCB&#39;s, the radioactive material must be handled with care, and often at great expense.</p> <p>Uranium fuel is only slightly radioactive before it is used, and is typically handled by technicians wearing no more than gloves and overalls. But when a chain reaction is induced, the uranium atoms split to give off energy and create &#39;&#39;fission products,&#39;&#39; atoms that are internally unstable and emit subatomic particles and energy waves called radiation. Foreseeing Problems</p> <p>In addition, when a uranium atom is split, some particles from its nucleus called neutrons are absorbed by the nuclei of other atoms, in the water, in minerals in the water, and in metal parts of the reactor, producing &#39;&#39;activation products,&#39;&#39; also unstable and radioactive.</p> <p>The possibility that the impasse over emergency planning at Shoreham might lead to the plant&#39;s abandonment was clearly foreseen three years ago when the regulatory commission gave the Long Island Lighting Company permission to operate Shoreham at up to 5 percent power for testing.</p> <p>Critics said then that such operation would raise the cost of abandonment. But the commission, in approving a low-power license, said Lilco could proceed &#39;&#39;at its own risk.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The utility, which for years had staked everything on the operation of the plant, has operated Shoreham for the equivalent of two and a half months of full operation, stretched out over the years since it received the low-power license in April 1985.</p> <p>How much that increased costs is not certain. A study completed by consultants for the regulatory agency three years ago said that a 1,000-megawatt reactor could be decommissioned after decades of use for $100 million, in 1985 dollars. Shoreham is 809 megawatts, and has far less radioactivity than a plant in commercial operation. But the New York Power Authority has said the price could be as high as $450 million.</p> <p>Mr. Steyer, of the regulatory agency, said that compared with a 30-year-old plant, Shoreham would have less waste, but that much of the planning would be the same, as would the manpower requirements.</p> <p>Other experts agreed. Many of the metal parts could be scrubbed clean, and the water then filtered, said Dale G. Bridenbaugh, a nuclear consultant who was formerly at General Electric, which supplied the key parts of the Shoreham plant.</p> <p>William J. Manion, the president of Nuclear Energy Services, of Danbury, Conn., said Shoreham could be dismantled using techniques employed at the Elk River reactor, an experimental plant in Elk River, Minn. His company managed that project almost 20 years ago.</p> <p>At Elk River, the radiation dose on the outside of the vessel was 30 rem per hour. A rem is a standard measure of radiation dose, and the regulatory commission sets a maximum exposure of 3 rem per calendar quarter, an amount that a worker would have absorbed in six minutes.</p> <p>Instead, the cutting was done by a remote-controlled plasma torch, mounted on a tripod above the vessel. The smoke and fumes, laden with radioactive material, were captured by high-volume, high-efficiency filter systems.  The Shoreham Power Station  1. Reactor building.

686641>City Agency Rejects State Over Report On Toxics The New York City Department of Investigation, concluding a six-week inquiry, said yesterday that the city had no legal obligation to give the state a report on toxic contaminants found at a site where the city wants to build a trash incinerator. At the same time, investigators said the city should have turned over the report &quot;to comply with the spirit of full disclosure.&quot; When the city finally gave the report to the state in March, six years after it was written, Langdon Marsh, the acting Commissioner of Environmental Conservation in Albany, ordered the city to conduct an investigation of the 13-acre site, within the 260-acre Brooklyn Navy Yard. The city and state are still negotiating over that order, and it is not clear whether a study, or a cleanup, would be needed before work could begin on the incinerator.  <p>Opponents have seized on the issue as another reason that the incinerator, which would burn 3,000 tons a day, should not be built. But the flap over what the city told the state may not make much difference to the schedule; the city&#39;s plan does not call for breaking ground until 1996, and the Giuliani adminstration is now re-evaluating the whole project and could delay it further.  Chemicals in the Soil</p> <p>The original report, prepared in 1988 by the Wehran Engineering Company, found fuel oil and PCB&#39;s (polychlorinated biphenyls) in the soil. Wehran recommended that the report be passed to the State Department of Environmental Protection.</p> <p>But the Department of Investigation found that &quot;no law clearly obligated the city, its agencies or its contractor to report the Wehran findings&quot; to the state. As the Department of Investigation noted, according to the Wehran report, the concentration of contaminants would have to have been five times higher before it would constitute hazardous waste.</p> <p>In a telephone interview Richard W. Mark, the First Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Investigation, quoted from the report: &quot;There is a distance between what you have a right to do and what the right thing to do is.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It would have been better if it had been disclosed,&quot; he said. &quot;Did they have a legal obligation to do that? We don&#39;t think so.&quot;</p> <p>Opponents of the incinerator said yesterday that the Department of Investigation had missed the point.</p> <p>Arthur S. Kell, of the New York Public Interest Research Group, said that the report was too forgiving of officials who did not want to disclose the report because it might hurt their project. &quot;It&#39;s almost like it being understandable that Richard Nixon would want to cover up Watergate,&quot; Mr. Kell said.</p>
525653>States&#39; Officials Endorse Smog Rules for Utilities Broadening the fight against smog, state and local air pollution officials on Monday unanimously approved recommendations for strict controls on emissions of nitrogen oxides from electricity generating stations. While the officials must still convince the governors of their states to go along, their resounding endorsement is a significant step because they are the states&#39; experts in the matter and the ones who would enforce the rules. The approval is comparable, say, to having state insurance commissioners unanimously agree on a new way to handle car insurance.  <p>The standards would cost utilities hundreds of millions of dollars a year, which would be passed on to consumers. But proponents say that spending the money on utility smokestacks would be more effective than spending it on the conventional smog targets: cars, oil refineries and industrial plants that use petroleum-based chemicals. On a percentage basis, the effect on rates paid by consumers would probably be small.</p> <p>Representatives of the utility industry said yesterday that if adopted, the recommendations could not possibly be met on schedule in states that rely heavily on coal. Pattern Set in Northeast</p> <p>By a show of hands at their national convention in San Francisco, the air-pollution officials adopted, with small modifications, the text of an agreement announced earlier this month by eight Northeastern states to cut nitrogen-oxide emissions. That agreement was approved by the governors of New York, New Jersey and the six New England states.</p> <p>The Northeast agreement was a landmark because it was the first widespread attack on smog to aim at utilities, and because it sidestepped a Bush Administration decision late last year not to issue regulations in this area. The vote by the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators, meeting in a joint convention with a fellow organization, the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials, is part of a continuing trend for the states to take joint action in the absence of guidance from Washington.</p> <p>&quot;We have an obligation under the Clean Air Act to impose controls on utilities this November, in order to address a nationwide smog problem,&quot; said William S. Becker, the executive director of both organizations. The Clean Air Act, passed in 1990, requires state controls by November on polluters that produce more than 100 tons of nitrogen oxides a year.</p> <p>&quot;It is unlikely that the E.P.A. will be publishing guidance in a timely manner to assist the states,&quot; Mr. Becker added. So the two organizations have formulated precise policies on how many pounds of nitrogen oxides power plants should be allowed to emit, he added.  Waiting for regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency, he said, was &quot;the air-quality equivalent of waiting for Godot.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Becker said Washington had not issued the regulations because utilities had lobbied the White House to block them. But at the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of the investor-owned utilities, James E. Evans, the director of environmental activities, said: &quot;I don&#39;t think anybody took any comfort in the delay. It&#39;s not a situation where delay is in the industry&#39;s favor.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Evans&#39;s organization would like what he called &quot;provisional regulations&quot; to be issued now, with final regulations waiting for the completion of new studies on smog formation. Smog, formally known as ground-level ozone, is produced in bright sunlight from molecules made of hydrogen and carbon, mostly from oil, and nitrogen oxides. But the rate of formation depends on the ratio of nitrogen oxides to hydrocarbons. In some situations, reducing the amount of nitrogen oxides could increase the production of smog, he argued.</p> <p>Mr. Evans said that in some cases, it might make sense for states to order even stricter controls than the ones voted on Monday, but that if that happened, some of the investment required to meet the more moderate standard would have been wasted.</p>
856452>Crash Investigators Focus on How Valujet And Contractor HandledDangerous Cargo Early on Saturday, May 11, a maintenance worker at Miami&#39;s airport loaded five heavy cardboard boxes containing oxygen generators onto a truck and drove them to the gate area where Valujet Flight 592 was due to depart for Atlanta. A Valujet worker signed for the boxes, which were loaded into the plane&#39;s forward cargo hold. They had been delivered with a form that described the generators as empty and as Valujet property being returned at the airline&#39;s request.  <p>That routine transfer, and the mundane paperwork that accompanied it, has become a focus of investigators&#39; attention since Flight 592 crashed in the Everglades a few hours later, after a fire broke out that the investigators suspect may have been started by the generators.</p> <p>In the weeks since the crash, Sabretech, the maintenance company that delivered the oxygen generators, and Valujet have pointed fingers, each trying to blame the other for the presence of the generators in the cargo hold. Over the next several weeks, Federal investigators will be trying to determine whether the generators caused the crash, and if so, how they ended up on the plane. But interviews with officials of both companies and a review of public records show that both may have missed opportunities to prevent the loading of dangerous materials.</p> <p>The chain of events began in February, when Valujet, a rapidly growing low-cost airline, leased three aging MD-80&#39;s, bigger versions of its staple, the DC-9. The planes, about 15 years old and originally flown by Adria, a Yugoslavian airline, were owned by the builder, McDonnell Douglas. Before Valujet could fly the planes, they needed extensive servicing. And Valujet relied on Sabretech for most of its repair work.</p> <p>Among the parts needing service were the oxygen generators installed over each group of seats. The generators are canisters filled with two chemicals, sodium chlorate and iron. When the chemicals are mixed by a tiny explosive charge that is detonated by a spring-loaded hammer, they make oxygen for emergency masks.</p> <p>When installed, the generators are vital safety equipment. When they are cargo, they are hazardous material and subject to special shipping rules because they reach 500 degrees when activated. Their manufacturer, Scott Aviation, says  that once used, the generators contain toxic salts and should be disposed of as  hazardous waste.</p> <p>As part of its servicing work, Sabretech removed all the generators -- up to  144, investigators say -- aboard the three planes because the chemicals had a limited shelf life, and their expiration date was fast approaching. The Sabretech technicians put the generators in five boxes under the planes on the floor of the hangar in the Miami airport where the planes were being overhauled.</p> <p>Valujet claims that Sabretech made errors in handling the generators. Airline officials say the five boxes were not properly packed for shipment because they  lacked inner dividers to hold the devices upright. An airline spokesman, who insisted on anonymity, said the airline also believed the boxes had not been manufactured specifically to carry generators. The devices were laid flat in each box, he said, with a layer of bubble-wrap over them.</p> <p>The airline also says the generators were mislabeled, each given a green ticket indicating that they could be repaired and returned to use. In fact, such generators are routinely discharged and then disposed of as hazardous waste, because cleaning the chemicals out is not worth the cost of the stainless steel  container. Sabretech work documents correctly indicated that the generators were not re-usable, Valujet says. The shipping document that accompanied the generators to the Valujet gate area labeled the generators as &quot;empty,&quot; but they  were not.</p> <p>Officials representing Sabretech agree that the generators were not packed for shipping, but say that is because they were not being sent to Valujet for shipping, even though a &quot;shipping ticket&quot; accompanied them. These officials say that it was up to Valujet to decide whether to ship the devices, and that the &quot;shipping ticket&quot; was simply a label to indicate what the material was and whom it belonged to. If the generators were being sent for shipping, the officials say, there would have been an airway bill, the document that accompanies air freight.</p> <p>In a statement made after the crash, Richard D&#39;Arcy, a Valujet mechanic who also has a pilot&#39;s license and worked for three years at McDonnell Douglas, said he saw the generators being removed from the planes on about April 10, and told  a Sabretech technician that they should be disposed of with Sabretech&#39;s hazardous waste. Mr. D&#39;Arcy said he repeated this advice about four days later when he saw the generators on a shelf in the hangar. He did not see the generators after about May 2, he said. When he saw them on May 2, they did not have the plastic safety caps that shield the generator from the firing pin.</p> <p>But Kenneth P. Quinn, a lawyer representing Sabretech, called Mr. D&#39;Arcy&#39;s statements, &quot;creative, after-the-fact interpretations.&quot;</p> <p>Where the generators spent the nine days between when Mr. D&#39;Arcy said he last saw them and the day of the crash is unclear. On May 10, the day before the crash, a Sabretech employee filled out a shipping ticket, which lists five boxes. The ticket had a description column, which reads, &quot;Oxy Cannisters.&quot; Under that, in quotation marks, it says &quot;Empty.&quot; The employee&#39;s signature is on the ticket; his first name is Andrew, but his last name is illegible.</p> <p>A Sabretech truck moved the material from the hangar to Valujet&#39;s ramp. There, the airline says, the Sabretech driver asked a Valujet employee, who signed the shipping ticket &quot;Christopher,&quot; but who has not been identified, to put the boxes and the tires on Flight 592 or the next one to Atlanta. Sabretech  often delivered material that it had serviced for Valujet for shipment to Atlanta, where Valujet has its headquarters.</p> <p>The boxes were labeled &quot;COMAT,&quot; which is short for company material, the airline and Sabretech agree.</p> <p>Christopher asked the driver to put the boxes on a baggage wagon. Both sides  agree that from there, they went into the forward hold.</p> <p>The question of responsibility seems to turn on legal definitions, including  whether Sabretech is a shipper. Valujet says that when Sabretech took the boxes  to Valujet, it had shipped them, and thus was obligated by Federal law to label  them with a yellow warning diamond, the kind often seen on highway trucks, marked &quot;oxidizer.&quot; That would have been a tip-off to the Valujet baggage handlers, the company says, and even if the handlers did not know what this meant, they would have told the captain, and she would have ordered them off the plane, because Valujet does not carry hazardous materials.</p> <p>Sabretech representatives say it was Valujet&#39;s decision to ship the boxes and thus the airline&#39;s responsibility to assure that they were packed correctly and  that they were materials the airline was permitted to carry.</p> <p>But Valujet officials, maintaining that Sabretech is the shipper, say companies that are licensed to handle hazardous wastes, like Sabretech, are obligated to deliver them only to other companies that are qualified to accept them, and Valujet is not qualified.</p> <p>Valujet is also arguing that different rules apply if some of the generators  were discharged. If they were spent, as they are supposed to be before shipping, then the process of exhausting them created hazardous waste, conferring certain  obligations on the waste generator, which would have been Sabretech. By this line of reasoning, Sabretech would have been required to label them as hazardous waste and note the date on which it began accumulating them, because environmental laws impose limits on how long they can be held.</p> <p>But Sabretech says it is not a hazardous waste generator, even if a few of the oxygen generators were discharged. Discharge and disposal are questions for  the generators&#39; owner, Valujet, according to Sabretech. Officials there said the environmental issue was a red herring; the generators removed from the planes could not be classifiable as waste at all, hazardous or otherwise, until Valujet decided what to do with them, Sabretech says.</p> <p>Sabretech argues that Valujet put the boxes on the plane, deciding on its own to ship the material back to Atlanta, and that no matter how the boxes were marked, they had material that Valujet is not allowed to carry, and thus the airline erred.</p> <p>The National Transportation Safety Board, which often stresses that it determines cause, not fault, on Friday issued an urgent recommendation to the Federal Aviation Administration that it examine how well airline cargo personnel are trained, with emphasis on spotting &quot;undeclared or unauthorized hazardous materials&quot;&#39; in baggage or freight.</p> <p>Meanwhile, investigators continue looking for pieces of the crashed airliner, to rule out electrical malfunctions as the cause.</p>
526102>Buckle Up, Volvo Says, In the Back Seat, Too If you are not wearing a seat belt and your car is in a serious accident, then the back seat is just as dangerous as the front passenger seat, according to an analysis of 2,000 crashes involving Volvos in Sweden. The analysis was made by the Volvo Car Corporation and the Swedish Road Safety Office. Rear-seat passengers who are not wearing belts are far more likely to be hurt in a crash than belted passengers, the study confirms. But Volvo safety experts add that unbelted passengers in back are a hazard not only to themselves but also to people in the front seats. In an accident, Volvo said, unrestrained rear passengers can hit the front seats hard enough to injure people seated in the front.  <p>The auto maker is trying to sell cars by convincing consumers that Volvos offer more protection in a crash. It stresses that it provides lap and shoulder belts even for the middle rear passenger, while most cars lack a shoulder belt for that person. But the findings, although based on Volvos in Sweden, are applicable to all makes of cars on American roads, said Dr. Carl Valenziano, the head of the American Trauma Society.</p> <p>Volvo collects the data because the cars it sells in Sweden come with an insurance policy. The study, released last fall in Europe at a conference on rear-seat safety and distributed by Volvo last month at the New York Auto Show, was based on data from five years in the 1970&#39;s; it showed that only 7.7 percent of the rear passengers in cars involved in accidents had been wearing belts.</p> <p>The study found that in accidents only 3 percent of the children wearing belts suffered head injuries, compared with 17 percent of those children who did not wear belts. (Head injuries are the most frequent injury to unbelted children.) Among adults, 10 percent of those who were belted sustained head injuries, compared with 17 percent for the unbelted.</p> <p>The study concluded: &quot;The risk of being injured, concerning both light injuries and serious to fatal injuries, does not lessen if an unbelted passenger moves from the front to the rear seat.&quot;</p>
660277>E.P.A. Says It Won&#39;t Order New Water-Filtration Plant Keeping New York City on a short leash, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency said yesterday that for the time being it would not require that the city build a multibillion-dollar water-filtration plant. But the city will have to adhere closely to a year-old program to take more than 150 steps to protect its water supply, the E.P.A. said. And the city will have to complete a preliminary design of the filtration plant.  That would mean no lost time if the E.P.A. eventually decides that the city has to build the plant.  <p>The city program, which stresses preventing pollution in its upstate reservoirs rather than cleaning up the pollution in them, includes activities like improving sewage-treatment plants of small towns in the 2,000-square-mile watershed, making sure that nearby septic systems work right, buying sensitive land near the reservoirs and changing the way that dairy farmers handle manure.</p> <p>Federal officials said that it was by no means certain that the program would be adequate in the long term, but that they were willing to give it a chance, as long as planning for a filtration plant proceeded.  Plan for $34 Million in Escrow</p> <p>&quot;It is a very complex program, probably not yet tried anywhere else in the country,&quot; said William J. Muszynski, acting administrator for the E.P.A. region that includes New York. The decision to let city officials continue their program, Mr. Muszynski said, &quot;provides a flexibility that government doesn&#39;t always provide.&quot;</p> <p>But the E.P.A. gave strict limits to how flexible it will be. For example, the city promised early this year that it would spend $44 million in 1993 on acquiring land upstate, but has spent less than $10 million. The Federal agency said yesterday that it wanted the rest of the money put in escrow. The city is supposed to spend $22 million a year through the year 2000.</p> <p>The head of the water system, Environmental Protection Commissioner Albert F. Appleton, said he was pleased with the decision and that the New York program would help change the national debate on water quality. Milwaukee, which filters its water, had an outbreak of waterborne disease in the summer. Washington, which also filters its water, found bacteria in its water a few weeks ago, he pointed out, &quot;raising a lot of questions about whether filtration is really all it&#39;s cracked up to be.&quot;</p> <p>New York, with no filtration, has largely avoided those problems, he said.</p> <p>At the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has been especially active on the issue, a lawyer, Eric Goldstein, said the announcement yesterday would not be as important as &quot;what the city actually does in the next two or three years.&quot;</p> <p>Under its decision the E.P.A. will not require a filtration plant be built &quot;until a further determination is made, or until Dec. 15, 1996, whichever comes first.&quot; In fact, the date means little, because the planning that the city is now required to carry out will not be finished until 1999.</p> <p>By going along with the city plan, the E.P.A. gained the authority to oversee it. If the Federal agency had simply said the plant had to be built, it would have had no say about watershed protection.</p> <p>As a practical matter, though, the plant and the watershed plan are not necessarily mutually exclusive, said Richard L. Caspe, director of water management at the E.P.A. If the watershed program is partly successful in, say, reducing turbidity -- holding down the number of waterborne organisms from animal wastes -- a filtration plant, if needed at all, might be smaller and simpler.</p> <p>No one really knows what a plant would cost. Mr. Caspe noted yesterday that the estimates ran from $2 billion to $8 billion, plus hundreds of millions of dollars a year in operating costs. It would be paid for through charges on water use in the city.</p> <p>Building the plant would take 5 to 15 years, depending on who is giving the estimates. City officials say watershed protection is not only cheaper, but can also be in place sooner.</p> <p>Mr. Muszynski said that at the moment the quality of New York water was excellent and that it met &quot;all of the avoidance criteria,&quot; so that no filtration is needed. But there is a chronic concern about turbidity, Federal and city officials agree. Water that is turbid, or cloudy, is harder to disinfect.</p> <p>The announcement yesterday largely continues programs in force, with notable additions. Previously the city had to complete conceptual de sign of a filtration plant, which meant picking a location, a capacity and a technology. Now it has to go a step further and finish a preliminary design, which involves much more engineering and the completion of a pilot-scale plant. On a project of this size the cost for that could run into the tens of millions of dollars.</p> <p>The E.P.A. said it would hold hearings in 60 days in the city and the watershed to seek comment on its decision.</p>
687763>California Regulators To Meet on Electric Cars California&#39;s air-quality regulators will meet today and tomorrow in Los Angeles to decide whether their requirement that auto makers put tens of thousands of &quot;zero emission vehicles&quot; -- electric cars -- into dealer showrooms in three and a half years is still a good idea. The meeting, a review by the California Air Resources Board to determine if the state&#39;s four-year-old program is technologically feasible, has national significance because the plan has been adopted by New York and Massachusetts, and 10 other Eastern states and the District of Columbia are trying to join it. By Federal law, states that adopt the California plan, which is the national model, are automatically bound by later revision.  <p>Early indications are that California will stay with its requirement that 2 percent of the cars offered for sale in the 1998 model year be electric, rising to 5 percent in 2001 and 10 percent in 2003. But no one really knows. A Change in Atmosphere</p> <p>The review, an event scheduled every other year, takes place in an atmosphere that has changed from the time the program began in September 1990; California is barely emerging from a deep economic slump for which business people partly blame costly government regulation. And the chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, Jananne Sharpless, who championed the program, has been replaced by Jacqueline E. Schaefer, a former environmental official in the Reagan and Bush Administrations.</p> <p>&quot;People are holding their cards pretty close to the vest,&quot; said Diane Wittenberg, manager of electric transportation for Southern California Edison, a big backer of electric cars.</p> <p>Electric utilities, the conventional auto makers and a raft of fledgling companies that make electric cars are watching the review closely. Some environmentalists plan to argue that California&#39;s plan is crucial to worldwide reductions in conventional pollutants and carbon dioxide, which scientists believe to be responsible for climate change.  A Plea From Auto Makers</p> <p>At the two-day public meeting, perhaps 100 speakers are expected to offer their views. Auto manufacturers will plead for the dropping of the requirement that they offer for sale a number of electric vehicles equal to 2 percent of their projected sales for the 1998 model year.</p> <p>After the meeting, the 11-member Air Resources Board could leave the standards in place, or it could schedule a hearing, which would signal a desire to amend them. Decisions of the board, an independent agency, can be appealed only to the courts.</p> <p>The board&#39;s staff has predicted that electric cars will sell well. But critics say Californians may like the idea in the abstract, but not when it comes to buying a car. &quot;There&#39;s no consumer demand for them in the magnitude&quot; that the California Air Resources Board wants to mandate them, said Douglas F. Henderson, executive director of the Western States Petroleum Association, an oil industry group. &quot;It seems to us to be a program that&#39;s doomed to fail.&quot; &#39;Poison the Well&#39;</p> <p>Ford voiced a related fear. Albert M. Chambers, a spokesman for the company, said that if the auto maker was forced to market the cars, it would do so because &quot;we don&#39;t break the law.&quot; But the vehicle would perform so poorly, he said, that it would &quot;poison the well&quot; for electric vehicle technology. The company has been working on a sodium-sulfur battery, which Mr. Chambers said would propel an electric car or van almost as far as consumers would expect, but he added, &quot;the cost is off the chart.&quot;</p> <p>Ford plans to ask the board today to negotiate a program whereby electric vehicles would be sold for use in fleets, like delivery trucks, rather than to the general public. Ford would also be willing to sell to electric-car companies new cars without gas tanks, engines and drivetrains, for conversion, if legal issues could be resolved. Ford wants to insure that it has no warranty or liability responsibility, and that the finished product is not labeled &quot;Ford.&quot;  New Battery Technologies</p> <p>But the board&#39;s staff says it thinks electric cars will be ready for general use by the 1998 model year. Batteries needed for a successful electric car are not in mass production, the staff said, but three technologies seem likely to bear fruit by then. They are nickel-metal hydride batteries, developed by the Ovonic Battery Company, of Troy, Mich., and now coming to market in laptop computers; sodium-nickel-chloride batteries being developed by the AEG Corporation, of Somerville, N.J., a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, and sodium-sulfur batteries, which are already in use in demonstration vehicles built by the Ford Motor Company.</p> <p>Leading the board as it reviews the decision is Ms. Schaefer, who served in various environmental posts in the Reagan and Bush Administrations.</p> <p>In January, she said to reporters at the Los Angeles Auto Show that &quot;I have a bias toward retaining the ZEV rule,&quot; -- ZEV referring to zero-emission vehicle. In testimony before a committee of the State Legislature in Sacramento in March, she said that in the long run electric vehicles would work only if a free market developed for them.</p> <p>But, she said, &quot;While these vehicles may not have the same range as a gasoline car, I think you&#39;d be surprised at how well they perform.&quot;</p>
1489358>TV Ad Campaign for Seat Belts Is to Focus on High-Risk Drivers With a television advertising budget worthy of a Hollywood movie rollout or a tight Senate race, the seat belt safety campaign will take to the airwaves for two weeks, beginning on Monday, with heavy emphasis on the WB Network, Univision, BET and ESPN. Extensive use of paid advertising, approved by Congress last year, partly replaces events like police roadblocks staged for news coverage of crackdowns on people driving unbelted or drunk. That got the word out to many drivers, but not the ones most likely to drive without belts, men ages 18 to 34, experts say. Those drivers &#39;&#39;don&#39;t watch Tom Brokaw or CNN,&#39;&#39; said Philip W. Haseltine, an organizer of this year&#39;s campaign.  <p>But they do watch Nascar, baseball, &#39;&#39;Fear Factor,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Black Star Cinema&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Cine de Estrellas,&#39;&#39; according to the Air Bag and Seat Belt Safety Campaign, which organizes an annual enforcement effort around Memorial Day.</p> <p>Mr. Haseltine, president of the Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety, said the campaign was focused on young men because they are over-represented in serious crashes and wear belts at rates far lower than the national average of about 75 percent.</p> <p>Last year Congress appropriated $25 million for broadcast advertising, of which $9.6 million will be spent by the safety campaign, and the remainder by 43 states. Of the 43, 31 will use the campaign&#39;s &#39;&#39;Click it or ticket&#39;&#39; theme.</p> <p>The organizers estimate that 70 percent of the target audience will see the advertisements.</p> <p>A new 30-second advertisement shows young men happily driving down sunny highways and then being pulled over and issued tickets for not wearing their belts. The strategy is based on the idea that young men do not fear death or disfigurement as much as they fear the flashing lights in the rearview mirror.</p> <p>And there will be a lot of flashing lights: 12,000 law enforcement agencies from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have said that they will participate in an enforcement campaign that will run from May 19 through June 1.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Ads by themselves are proven not to do anything,&#39;&#39; Mr. Haseltine said.</p>
565632>Gasoline Mileage and Jobs President Bush is seizing on the issue of gasoline mileage rules in his re-election campaign, running radio ads in Michigan and Ohio that predict huge job losses at local auto factories if a Democratic administration tightens the standards. And some industry groups agree with him. But efficiency advocates say that raising the standard, now at 27.5 miles a gallon, would actually create jobs in the auto industry and elsewhere in the economy, and Gov. Bill Clinton says he does not favor a law that would raise the standard above what the industry can achieve.  <p>The two clashed on fuel economy in the debate on Monday evening, one of the few times they have mentioned energy issues.</p> <p>The Bush radio ads say that Governor Clinton&#39;s &quot;radical environmental proposals require increasing car mileage standards to 40 miles per gallon in 8 years.&quot;  Dropped by Congress</p> <p>Earlier this year, when Congress considered new energy legislation, it debated raising the current auto mileage standard, which was set in 1975. But in a political package deal, it dropped that idea, along with a proposal to let oil companies drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p> <p>The Motor Vehicle Manufacturer&#39;s Association asserts that the domestic industry would lose 150,000 to 300,000 jobs if the United States moved to a standard of 40 miles a gallon. But proponents of stricter standards said that the manufacturers had simply counted the jobs in factories that today produce cars that would not meet the new standard, and that the proposal gave the companies time to adjust.</p> <p>The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a Washington-based study and lobbying group, recently predicted that stricter mileage rules would generate jobs by giving consumers extra money that would otherwise have been spent on fuel, and would even increase employment in the auto business.</p> <p>&quot;The industry will retool and add energy-efficiency features to vehicles, and thereby add value to their vehicles, which means more engineers, more assemblers, more parts suppliers, and more revenue and economic activity for auto producers,&quot; said Howard Geller, the executive director.</p> <p>Mileage gives small price incentive; the American Automobile Association&#39;s &quot;average&quot; car costs $5,865 a year to run, and raising its fuel economy by 40 percent would save less than $250, or about 4 percent.</p>
753710>Reluctantly Charging Toward &#39;98 THE Big Three are all working hard on electric cars, not out of enthusiasm, but to comply with an impending requirement in California -- since adopted by New York and Massachusetts -- that 2 percent of the cars offered for sale by the 1998 model year have &quot;zero emissions.&quot; The auto manufacturers&#39; hardest work on the issue has sometimes seemed to be in courtrooms, but they have failed to persuade judges to overturn the rules. The Big Three are still trying to negotiate with clean-air regulators, but they are also building cars.  <p>The General Motors Corporation appears to be ahead of the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation. A G.M. subsidiary, GM Hughes Electronics, builds the computer control module for the Impact and also sells a system in wide use by other electric car teams. And the Impact body is an achievement, with an aerodynamic design that slices through the wind with half the resistance of some conventional cars. It is also lightweight and its tires have very low rolling resistance.</p> <p>Ford&#39;s entry, the Ecostar van, won an electric car race last year, the Tour de Sol. It has a high-energy power storage system, sodium sulfur batteries, a technology that Ford invented in the 1960&#39;s. But the batteries operate at high temperature, a potential safety problem, and their cost remains far above that of lead-acid batteries, which themselves are no bargain. And Ford has had two fires in Ecostars while they were being charged. Sodium sulfur is not an option in the near term, the company says.</p> <p>Still, Ford says it has gained considerable operating experience from a fleet of Eco stars that it has leased to businesses. And the company is negotiating to sell &quot;gliders&quot; -- Ford chassis with no engines -- to electric-car converters. The cars would still carry the Ford oval trademark, could be sold by Ford dealers, and could help meet Ford&#39;s 2 percent quota.</p> <p>Chrysler is a step farther behind. It is expected to announce soon a successor to its electric mini-van, a vehicle with acceleration so excruciatingly slow that Lee Iacocca made fun of it when he introduced it at the New York Auto Show a few years ago.</p> <p>In contrast to the big auto makers, the Solectria Corporation, based in Wilmington, Mass., is driven by enthusiasm for the technology. But it does not expect to sell many cars to individuals, even ardent environmentalists, in the near future, because its costs are so high. (The company starts its vehicle conversions by throwing away perfectly serviceable gasoline engines.)</p> <p>Beyond the Force and the E-10, Solectria has a new ground-up design made of lightweight composites and hopes to market the vehicle widely in partnership with Boston Edison. Solectria appears to have the lead in some aspects of technology, like keeping the batteries warm in winter.</p> <p>Another company, U.S. Electricar of Seb astopol, Calif., tried to make a go of converting small pickups and sedans, but recently said it would quit the field and concentrate on heavy-duty vehicles. Other companies plan to start building electric vehicles soon.</p> <p>State officials hope that once mass production has lowered costs, demand will rise and quotas will become irrelevant. The auto companies are skeptical.</p> <p>But if you can&#39;t wait to have an electric vehicle, there is always the option of yanking the engine out of an old car and converting it yourself. The California Energy Commission, in a national survey in January, found 14 companies that sell conversion kits.</p>
1551246>New System For Air Security Moves Forward Stymied by the domestic airlines in trying to test a massive new computer system meant to identify people who are risks to civil aviation, the government is thinking of using data collected by European airlines instead, an official said on Sunday night. The agency responsible for the new system, the Transportation Security Adminstration, wants to test the system, the Computerized Assisted Passenger PreScreening System, which would evaluate information on everyone seeking to board a domestic flight.  <p>The government is moving ahead with the system despite objections from privacy experts and uncooperative airlines, and hopes to have it in place by this summer. Plans to begin the program this year were reported Sunday in The Washington Post.</p> <p>Last year, the agency asked for an airline to volunteer information on its passengers for use in testing. Jet Blue agreed last summer to provide data for testing but backed out after complaints about its decision. The airline industry officials suggested that the government should order the airlines to comply.</p> <p>In December, however, the Department of Homeland Security struck an agreement with the European Union on what passenger information would have to be submitted by airlines flying to the United States from Europe. The information is transmitted shortly after take-off.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration, Nico Melendez, said on Sunday that the agreement permitted his agency to use that data for testing the prescreening system.</p> <p>Last year, the government proposed the new system, which would replace an older version that uses less information.</p> <p>The new system would call for airlines to provide each passenger&#39;s name, home address, phone number and date of birth. Under this proposal, which was disclosed last year, a contractor for the Transportation Security Administration would take the passenger data and compare it to commercial databases.</p> <p>The contractor would then give each passenger a score, similar to a credit score for a loan, that would estimate the relative security risk.</p>
821104>Alcohol Found in Pilot&#39;s Remains in Colombia Laboratory tests on the body of the captain of the American Airlines 757 that crashed near Cali, Colombia, on Dec. 20 found alcohol in the remains, the Federal Aviation Administration said early this morning, but it was not immediately clear whether the source was liquor or chemical processes that could have occurred after death. A spokeswoman for the agency, Sandra Allen, said in a statement just after midnight that &quot;the F.A.A. on Wednesday was advised by U.S. sources in Colombia that initial forensic tests indicate the presence of alcohol in the remains.&quot; But there was no official word from Colombia, she said.  <p>Ms. Allen said that she believed that the tissue samples were not recovered  and refrigerated for 36 to 72 hours after the crash. She said there was no information about lab results on the other pilot.</p> <p>The executive vice president of operations for American Airlines, Bob Baker,  said in a statement late Wednesday night, &quot;Obviously we would be shocked if tests confirm the use of alcohol by one of our pilots during a duty period.&quot;</p> <p>The airline has already acknowledged that the cause of the crash may be errors by the flight crew. Miles off course, the plane slammed into a mountain in the Andes and 160 of the 164 people aboard were killed.</p> <p>American said the &quot;F.A.A. intends to retest the forensic samples in the U.S.&quot; But Ms. Allen said that investigation and testing was in the jurisdiction of the Colombian authorities. The F.A.A. would offer full cooperation, she said, but would not conduct the tests itself. She said the Colombian authorities might conduct a second test themselves in an independent laboratory in the United States.</p> <p>American officials have repeatedly deferred to their Colombian counterparts,  and have said that they do not want to offend the Colombians by appearing to take over their investigative function.</p> <p>Alcohol has previously been found in tissue samples of pilots killed in air crashes. A analysis of tests of pilots in crashes in the United States in 1989 and 1990, found alcohol in the tissue of 79, or about 8 percent, of the pilots,  but Further tests showed that a quarter of those pilots were flying under the influence and that in another quarter, the alcohol was produced in the tissues after the crash. But for 36 of the 79, no clear determination was possible.</p>
744788>Perils of Invisible Foe Are Often Tied to Heat Systems Each year, about 250 people in the United States are killed by carbon monoxide and 5,000 more are injured, some permanently, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Most often, the source is a heating system or water heater that has a cracked flue or a blocked chimney. While experts say equipment fueled by natural gas appears to be the most troublesome, carbon monoxide can also come from heating systems using oil, propane or coal, from cars running in attached garages, or from charcoal grills used indoors.  <p>In the incident yesterday in Brooklyn in which dozens of people were overcome, carbon monoxide, which is odorless and colorless, apparently was released when underground Con Edison cables caught fire. The furnace in the building was in good condition, according to Brooklyn Union Gas, which inspected it.</p> <p>Carbon monoxide is produced from incomplete combustion, that is, burning with limited oxygen. If there is enough oxygen for a fuel to burn completely, the gas produced is carbon dioxide, which is not toxic.</p> <p>In home heating systems that use forced hot air, a crack in the metal box in which the air is heated can let smoke into the box and then, through the heating ducts, into the living area. In all heating systems, a blocked chimney can let smoke back into a house. A faulty heating system was blamed for the death of Vitas Gerulaitis, the tennis star, in a cottage in Southampton, L.I., in September.</p> <p>When carbon monoxide enters the lungs, it latches on to hemoglobin, the component of blood that normally shuttles oxygen to the cells, and refuses to let go. With less oxygen being delivered around the body, drowsiness, headache and nausea set in, followed, at increasing levels of poisoning, by respiratory failure, convulsions and death.</p> <p>While carbon monoxide is invisible and odorless, often the smoke that comes with it warns people who are exposed. But because the gas makes people drowsy, many victims die as they sleep. And heating systems that run relatively cleanly, especially natural gas and propane systems, often have smoke so clean that it can go unnoticed.</p> <p>In October, Chicago began requiring carbon-monoxide detectors in some houses that use natural gas, but no other major American cities do. Experts say, though, that they are a good idea.</p> <p>&quot;Whether you&#39;re required to, or you have the choice, if you have gas-burning appliances or a garage attached to a house, you should buy at least one carbon monoxide detector,&quot; said Tim Montgomery, a spokesman for Underwriters Laboratories, an independent, nonprofit testing organization based in Northbrook, Ill. The first one should go in a hallway near bedroom doors, he said.</p> <p>&quot;If you can afford it, put another one in an area near one of the gas-burning appliances,&quot; he said. The units sell for $30 to $70 in hardware stores and resemble smoke detectors. Some have batteries and others plug in.</p> <p>To reduce the risk, experts also advise having fuel-burning appliances inspected annually. Underwriters Laboratories also advises watching for streaks of carbon or soot around fuel-burning appliances.</p> <p>New York City requires smoke detectors but has no regulations or advice concerning carbon monoxide detectors, according to George Semidey, a spokesman for the Fire Department. But New York is studying the Chicago rule, which requires such detectors in new houses and existing single-family houses when new furnaces are installed. Several smaller cities have similar requirements.</p> <p>Hardware stores also sell cardboard strips that change color in the presence of carbon monoxide, but Underwriters Laboratories advises against them. &quot;It doesn&#39;t warn you if there&#39;s a problem when you&#39;re not looking at it,&quot; said Mr. Montgomery.</p> <p>But the models that sound an alarm are also not trouble free. In December, Chicago experienced unusually high carbon monoxide levels on the streets, from cars and other sources, and this set off thousands of new carbon monoxide detectors. Underwriters Laboratories is considering new standards for the detectors, so that they cannot be set off so easily.</p> <p>&quot;If it becomes a nuisance, people are going to disregard the detector or turn it off,&quot; said Mr. Montgomery.</p>
714175>Transportation Workers Face More Frequent Tests for Drugs Thousands of bus drivers, train engineers and other transportation workers in the region will face more frequent random testing for drugs and alcohol beginning in January under a Federal law that is expected to cost regional transit operators millions of dollars a year. The New York Transit Authority expects its annual cost of testing to rise to $5 million from $1.5 million.  <p>It&#39;s going to be a complicated proposition,&quot; said Jared Lebow, a Transit Authority spokesman, &quot;with some overtime or regularly scheduled extra train operators or bus operators, to make sure we don&#39;t impact service too greatly.&quot;</p> <p>The law requires that transit systems conduct one random urine test for drugs each year for every two employees in &quot;safety sensitive&quot; jobs, and one breath test for alcohol for every four &quot;safety sensitive&quot; employees.</p> <p>The degree to which alcohol is a problem is not clear. In August 1991 a drunken subway operator killed five people in a crash in Union Square, which prompted New York to increase its testing. In contrast, Connecticut Transit, a bus system with 775 employees, conducted 1,172 random tests over three years from 1991 to 1993 and found no alcohol use. It did find more than a dozen with traces of marijuana or cocaine, though.</p> <p>Some bus drivers in Connecticut and New Jersey have never been subject to random alcohol tests.</p> <p>At the Federal Transit Authority, Judy Z. Meade, the senior drug and alcohol program manager, said that some systems that had never tested would find &quot;in the neighborhood of 5 to 6 percent positive tests.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Rates will be fairly high for the first two years, because it takes time for corporate climate to change,&quot; Ms. Meade said. &quot;It takes time for John Doe to see his buddy Sam Smith be hauled away.&quot; But the deterrent will grow over time, she said.</p> <p>The Federal rules, issued by the Department of Transportation in February under the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing of 1991, requires testing in the middle of workers&#39; shifts, which means having substitute workers available. Most systems that test now do it at the beginning or end of the work day.</p> <p>Conducting even half as many tests as there are employees will not insure that everyone is tested. Michael A. Sanders, the Transit and Ridesharing Administrator at the Connecticut Department of Transportation, said that despite having conducted nearly 1,200 random tests in three years on a work force of 775, about 200 people have never been tested.</p> <p>While the Connecticut tests found no alcohol, Mr. Lebow said that at the New York Transit Authority in 1993, 0.47 percent tested positive for alcohol on random tests, and 1.85 percent in drug tests. The drug rate was comparable to Connecticut Transit&#39;s.</p> <p>The Transit Authority and other systems also conduct tests as part of pre-employment physicals, when workers return to duty after extended absences, after accidents, and whenever the authority is suspicious.</p> <p>At the Port Authority, about 1,400 employees who drive snowplows, dump trucks and runway sweepers will be subject to testing for the first time, said John M. Kampfe, a spokesman. Another 450 workers on the PATH system, including engineers, train dispatchers and signalmen are already tested for drugs, but not alcohol.</p> <p>At New Jersey Transit, existing drug tests nearly meet the new Federal standards, said Elizabeth Schneider, director of medical services. But alcohol tests will be new and will probably turn up a substantial number of people working under the influence, especially in rail operations, she said. &quot;People work unsupervised,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s a traditional railroad problem.&quot;</p> <p>Under the new Federal regulations, breath test readings showing a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.02 to 0.039 constitute grounds for taking an employee out of service for up to eight hours. From 0.04 up, the employee must be removed from the job and referred to a substance abuse program for professional evaluation, she said.</p> <p>In most states a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.1 (or two and a half times as high as 0.04) is sufficient to convict the driver of a private automobile of driving while impaired or drunk.</p>
637645>This Autumn in New York, Fear of Asbestos Is in the Air SOMEDAY, maybe every pollutant will be famous for 15 minutes. Right now it&#39;s asbestos&#39;s turn. In a city filled with threats, environmental and otherwise, asbestos has nearly become an obsession. New York City had a crash program to find and remove dangerous asbestos in schools after a 1986 Federal law. Now it has another. Politicians rage, parents protest, investigators investigate and lots of people worry, including kids who are attending schools marked by the modern version of a witch&#39;s hex mark, duct tape.  <p>The direct cost for cleanup has been $50 million, money that arguably would have to have been spent at some point anyway, but not while keeping children on extended vacation, sometimes joined by a parent who ordinarily would have been at work.</p> <p>But there was none of the affability of a snow day, none of the grin-and-bear-it response to an act of God.</p> <p>The tale has all the elements of an environmental whodunit: fraud, mismanagement, carcinogens and a million innocent children. Most of the schools opened last week, but only after 11 days of delay and frantic visits by inspectors with clipboards and sample bottles.</p> <p>Is it worth it? Deep down, some school officials think that it is not, but don&#39;t want to sound like a seventh grader explaining, failing paper in hand, that long division isn&#39;t much use in the real world anyway.</p> <p>The worries about asbestos date back to the findings, more than a decade ago, that it caused premature deaths among people exposed to large quantities in industrial settings, especially those who were also smokers. The importance of non-industrial exposure is under debate, but Federal law prescribes that asbestos that could become airborne should be sealed or removed from schools.</p> <p>Whatever the scientific truth, since the potential victims are mostly children and exposure is a function of attendance, which is mandated by law, the consensus is that the law&#39;s requirements are prudent. But they allow little leeway to balance unknown risks against obvious disruption.</p> <p>Is it over? No, and it won&#39;t be even after all the schools reopen. Asbestos will be there as long as the buildings are. Whenever there is damage or construction work, there will be asbestos.</p> <p>Is it, as the educators like to say, teaching us anything? Not about asbestos. The debate over how to handle it still rages. Michigan&#39;s legislature recently passed a bill forbidding removal of asbestos in schools unless fibers are found in the air, while other jurisdictions favor a far more aggressive approach.</p> <p>Are there more dangerous problems? Plenty. Over the summer, for example, a water-borne parasite, cryptosporidium, sickened thousands in Milwaukee. That possibility does not keep New Yorkers up at night worrying, perhaps because cryptosporidium is harder than asbestos to pronounce.</p> <p>There are many possible models for the direction the asbestos crisis might take; among them are those of grapes and chromium.</p> <p>The grapes are a cautionary tale for the way modern communications and testing methods can warn us of dangers that are not really there. In early March 1989, the American embassy in Santiago got two phone calls warning that Chilean fruit had been poisoned.The Food and Drug Administration promptly found cyanide in two seedless red grapes on a ship in Philadelphia. On Government advice, millions of people stopped buying grapes.</p> <p>But four days later, another test on the same grapes found no cyanide, and the alert was canceled. About the time the cyanide wasn&#39;t in the grapes, chromium turned up in the dirt in Jersey City, Kearney and Secaucus, and the state&#39;s deputy health commissioner said it was potentially more serious than Love Canal, in Niagara Falls, N.Y., or Times Beach, Mo., which were evacuated because of pollution with industrial chemicals. Chromium migrates through ground water. It can cause breathing difficulty, skin irritation and ulceration. According to the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s Cancer Assessment Group, it is a potent carcinogen.</p> <p>Four years later, it is still something the locals live with and scientists are tracking down. The state health department examined 2,224 people, finding 44 with rashes or irritation on the skin or nasal tissues and 223 with elevated levels in their urine. Now researchers are looking at chromium levels in those people&#39;s homes.</p> <p>For asbestos, in contrast, there are no tests available to measure past exposure, and no early symptoms, like rashes. In high exposures in industrial settings there has been a clear link with asbestosis; for people in school buildings there is a less clear risk, at least in theory, of cancer down the road.</p> <p>And for New York&#39;s children there is the elephant of a problem that is so close that people have mistaken its legs for ordinary trees.</p> <p>Last weekend, before the belated start of school, a 7-year-old who was to enter the second grade, Chisandre Curry, was shot in the head in a Chinese restaurant in Brooklyn. She was, by police count, the 71st child under age 17 shot on the city&#39;s streets this year as an innocent bystander, although the term seemed superfluous.</p> <p>THE NATION</p>
697415>A Battery Built on Wheel Power Taking a new approach of storing energy mechanically instead of chemically, the United Technologies Corporation has developed a device that engineers at the company and elsewhere believe can bring electric cars far closer to practicality. The device, a flywheel battery, makes up for a big shortcoming in the batteries now used in electric cars: it allows the car greater bursts of power, a longer range before recharging, and a longer life for the existing chemical battery, which it would supplement.  <p>The company has delivered one of the devices to the German auto maker BMW, which was to demonstrate it today in Munich. BMW has not formally committed itself to using the device in a car, according to United Technologies, but it is developing the containment box into which the device would go.</p> <p>United Technologies plans to deliver another one of the units late this summer to Solectria, a small Massachusetts maker of electric cars, which plans to install it in an experimental electric pickup truck the Government is testing at Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Mass.</p> <p>A major problem with current electric-car systems is that if they are called on to deliver a lot of power quickly, they will not take the car as far before recharging and they wear out more quickly. The United Technologies flywheel battery, a supplement to conventional chemical batteries, would improve performance by providing surges of power when needed, and would add to range by absorbing extra energy available during braking and then storing it for future use. In both roles it would reduce wear and tear on the chemical batteries, helping them last longer.</p> <p>The flywheel battery could also be used in a hybrid vehicle. In the hybrid, the car&#39;s wheels would be powered by an electric motor that would operate off a small bank of conventional batteries. Those batteries would be charged by an internal-combustion engine or a turbine engine that would have to be only 20 or 30 horsepower. The flywheel battery could add current to drive the car wheels during acceleration.</p> <p>Dr. Thomas W. Grudkowski, manager of the flywheel program at United Technologies, said the company was extremely pleased with the progress on the device, which he said had promising market potential. Some Questions Remain</p> <p>He said he would not discuss just what potential the company foresaw, because that was a business secret. Still to be demonstrated are what the battery would cost to mass-produce, and how durable the flywheel in the battery would prove.</p> <p>But others also see potential. &quot;It&#39;s an exciting technology to complement chemical batteries,&quot; said Sheila Lynch, the executive director of the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Coalition, an agency in Boston that evaluates technologies and dispenses money from the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Defense Department.</p> <p>The computer controls needed to run the flywheel battery are now cheap enough to make several companies think the technology is feasible. All flywheel batteries use electric motors with a big wheel attached to store mechanical energy. Like all motors, these take in electricity and produce mechanical force. And, like all motors, these can generate electricity by drawing on the mechanical force stored in the wheel.</p> <p>Some other companies at work on flywheel batteries see them as potential stand-alone energy sources for electric cars. United Technologies sees them as a complement to regular batteries, which rely on chemical reactions that absorb electricity when the reaction runs in one direction and give off electricity when it runs in the opposite.</p> <p>Most companies in the field are small start-ups, but United Technologies is a multinational conglomerate with a subsidiary, UT Automotive Inc., that had sales of $2.4 billion in car parts last year and specializes in electrical devices. Floating in Magnetic Field</p> <p>The United Technologies system uses advanced high-strength carbon composites for the spinning wheel, and incorporates computerized controls for the bearings, which keep the spinning parts floating in a magnetic field so they make no physical contact with stationary parts. The flywheel can be started by the chemical battery or powered by energy that is recaptured from the vehicle&#39;s wheels during braking and turned back into electricity by the car&#39;s drive motors.</p> <p>What is especially relevant for the Northeast, Ms. Lynch said, is that flywheels, unlike lead-acid batteries, are not affected by cold weather.</p> <p>The flywheel battery can absorb or deliver power at an enormous rate, a characteristic called power density. That is a contrast to conventional batteries, which are like flasks with very thin necks; no matter what their capacity, they can only absorb or deliver their energy slowly, and they are damaged if energy moves in or out too fast.</p> <p>Also, while withdrawing energy too fast from a lead-acid battery reduces the total that can be withdrawn, like squeezing toothpaste from the middle of the tube, a flywheel does not share that problem.</p> <p>Thus, according to engineers, a flywheel battery, even if it does not store tremendous amounts of energy, can painlessly deliver huge surges of power needed for acceleration, and can recapture the flood of electricity that electric cars can generate when they slow down and their drive motors are briefly converted into generators instead. Most electric car designs make use of this &quot;regenerative braking,&quot; but the power comes in so fast that lead-acid batteries cannot capture it, and, as with trying to fill drinking glasses from a garden hose, most of what is delivered is lost.</p> <p>The heart of the system is a 55-pound doughnut about the size of a motorcycle tire, made of strands of a carbon composite, and spun at speeds up to 30,000 revolutions per minute. The lab model delivered to BMW stores about 550 watt-hours, only a little more energy than is stored by the typical battery under the hood of gasoline-powered cars today. Dr.  Grudkowski said that engineers were rapidly pushing toward 35,000 r.p.m., which would store 800 watt-hours.</p> <p>United Technologies is not the first to think of flywheels; for the last two years, for example, American Flywheel Systems, a small company in Medina, Wash., has been showing off a prototype that powers a videocassette player and television set.</p> <p>That company is working on a larger unit for cars; the plan is that a sedan would have 6, 8, 10 or 12 flywheels, just as internal combustion cars have 4, 6 or 8 cylinders. Of all the companies working in the area, American Flywheel is the only one with a design that includes no other power source or energy storage device, just flywheels.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Satcon Technology Corporation of Cambridge, Mass., is scheduled to deliver a huge flywheel next month to Chrysler for use in an electric race car that gets its power from a turbine burning liquefied natural gas. The Satcon flywheel is supposed to store 4.5 kilowatt-hours of energy, roughly five times the United Technologies model. Its function is similar, though: to store or deliver huge amounts of power acting in concert with the turbine, which operates best at a steady level of demand.</p> <p>Trinity Flywheel, a start-up company in San Francisco using technology developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory of the Energy Department, has a large, nonportable flywheel that is meant for &quot;power conditioning,&quot; or assuring a steady flow of power to computers and sensitive industrial equipment. It draws power from the local utility grid to spin the wheel, and uses the spinning wheel to generate electricity; if the electricity supply from the grid fails or even flutters, there is enough energy stored in the wheel to keep the output of electricity rock steady.</p> <p>The company is trying to scale that technology down to a size suitable for automotive use, according to Donald A. Bender, the project engineer. Trinity is negotiating with General Motors on uses for the device, he said.</p> <p>But the United Technologies model, developed at the company&#39;s technical research center in East Hartford, Conn., is the first working prototype anyone has delivered that is sized for an everyday automobile.</p> <p>United Technologies says the research effort cost it several million dollars. Some financing was provided by the Pentagon, through Ms. Lynch&#39;s agency. Ms. Lynch said she found United Technologies&#39; involvement very encouraging for electric cars. &quot;They wouldn&#39;t spend two years and enormous capital on this unless there were some commercial viability of this product in the automotive world,&quot; she said.</p> <p>Northeast Utilities, the big New England electric company, has also contributed money. It is interested in flywheel batteries for automotive use and for stationary applications, such as storing electricity for use in peak periods, or storing electricity from intermittent sources, like sun or wind, until it is needed, said William L. Stillinger, director of technology and transmission planning</p> <p>Northeast hopes to acquire the Solectria truck after its year at Hanscom.  BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
842749>New Pressures on Airline Crash-Liability Accord The Warsaw Convention governing the liability of an airline when passengers die in a plane crash is crumbling as airlines try to raise the accord&#39;s $75,000  limit on damages. But prospects for a new agreement are uncertain, because the United States Department of Transportation is demanding that the accord provide that damage suits involving Americans be heard in the United States. Some foreign airlines reject that demand.  <p>This is the third effort to raise the $75,000 limit, which was set in 1966 and all parties agree is now far too low. Efforts in 1977 and 1988 would have raised the limit several-fold and were eagerly supported by American officials,  but the United States did not approve them. Trial lawyers said the higher limits were still too low, and aircraft manufacturers feared high limits would encourage suits against them.</p> <p>&quot;The amount of time it&#39;s taking to do something rational is simply astonishing,&quot; said Jeffrey N. Shane, an aviation lawyer who was Assistant Secretary of Transportation for policy and international affairs from 1989 to 1993.</p> <p>The Warsaw Convention, initiated in 1929 among 29 countries and joined by the United States in 1934, also governs who may sue and where, and details cargo rules. All nations with commercial airlines have signed on, but the airlines agree that the document needs to be updated.</p> <p>Because of the low liability limit, many airlines are voluntarily paying more, either to spare themselves a lengthy trial at which families will try to show negligence -- which allows higher damages -- or for general good will, or because they do not think the limits will hold up in court.</p> <p>American Airlines, for example, has told families of the people who died when one of its planes crashed in Colombia in December that it would negotiate as if  the limit did not exist; it is doing the same for the 16 passengers on international trips who were on the American Eagle commuter flight that crashed  in Roselawn, Ind., in October 1994.</p> <p>&quot;The message American is sending is, &#39;We&#39;ll do what&#39;s fair, because we know a jury will do what&#39;s fairer,&#39; &quot; said Barry Lambert Harris, who was an acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the Bush Administration.</p> <p>But the airlines would like a realistic limit and uniform system. Representatives of airlines from around the world met this week in Montreal to try to work out the details of a system with no limits. United States airlines have received an antitrust exemption to negotiate an agreement, which would be subject to Government approval.</p> <p>The airlines and American officials envision fairly simple negotiations with  families over &quot;economic damages,&quot; the amount that the victim was likely to have  earned over the remaining years of his or her life, given normal life expectancy. The sticking point now is which court would resolve disputes if negotiations failed.</p> <p>Under the current agreement, survivors can bring suit in the country the plane was flying to, the home country of the airline, a country where the airline has its major operation or the country where the contract for transportation was written.</p> <p>The United States wants a &quot;fifth jurisdiction&quot; for Americans: the United States. Since domestic carriers are based here, they can already be sued here; adding the &quot;fifth jurisdiction&quot; would generally affect overseas carriers.</p> <p>Hans Ephraimson-Abt, whose 23-year-old daughter, Alice, died in the crash of  Korean Air Lines flight 007 13 years ago, and whose case is still in court in New York, said that 147 of the 269 passengers on that flight had had their cases settled for $75,000; among them were a few Americans who could not get access to an American court. Other cases are still pending in Japan or the Philippines. The plane, shot down by the Soviet Union when it strayed into Soviet airspace, was en route to Tokyo.</p> <p>Mr. Ephraimson-Abt, the chairman of the American Association for Families of  KAL 007 Victims, said some Americans on the flight had not bought their tickets  in this country and had to sue in South Korea, but the Korean courts had thrown  the cases out, a ruling both he and prosecutors in Seoul attribute to corruption.</p> <p>Mr. Ephraimson-Abt said that without the $75,000 limit, all the cases would have been settled years ago. Instead, he and other relatives of plane crash victims say, cases can drag on so long that victims&#39; small children are beyond college age before any damage awards are made.</p> <p>Differing economic standards and points of view are also problems, he said. Many people in third world countries &quot;think all Americans are millionaires,&quot; and are not sympathetic to them, he added.</p> <p>Consequently, some foreign carriers are balking at submitting to the jurisdiction of American courts. But not all foreign carriers are hiding behind  the $75,000 shield. In 1992, the Japanese airlines voluntarily renounced the $75,000 limit on international flights, and 12 international airlines, meeting in Kuala Lumpur in November, agreed in principle to waive all limits.</p> <p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t wash well anywhere,&quot; said George N. Tompkins, an American lawyer  who represents Japan Air Lines and other foreign carriers.</p> <p>But Mr. Tomkins said some foreign carriers would object to any agreement that subjects them to American courts, with traditional American levels of compensation.</p> <p>On the other hand, Anne H. McNamara, the head lawyer at American Airlines, said, &quot;We are not availing ourselves of the limit because it is so unfair.&quot; Still, if the airline is unable to reach a settlement in a damage case and it ends up in court, American may invoke that limit, she said. However, most airlines are buying insurance against such suits, and the insurance companies generally assume that the $75,000 limit will be ignored by American juries.</p> <p>She added that juries in American courts &quot;like to do rough justice,&quot; and will declare an airline negligent if that is what it takes to get around the limit and award higher damages.</p> <p>But insisting that foreign airlines submit to an American court will be difficult, said Mr. Shane, the former Under Secretary of Transportation, for it  would mean making airline tickets different legally from all other kinds of purchases; if those result in litigation, he said, the suit is in the place where the transaction occurred.</p>
387999>U.S. Plans Sale Of Reserve&#39;s Oil To Lower Prices Complaining that there is &#39;&#39;no justification&#39;&#39; for the recent run-up in oil prices, President Bush announced last night that the United States would sell five million barrels from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a test.  <p>The sale is a token amount in the oil market and will have little effect on total supplies since the United States imports that much oil every 18 hours. But after weeks of speculation in the industry and among economists about whether the reserve would be used, industry experts said last night that the announcement would be, in effect, a warning that market participants who are tempted to pay high prices for oil could end up holding barrels that could soon decline in value.</p> <p>Hint of Further Sales</p> <p>Indeed, President Bush hinted that if prices did not stabilize, he would consider larger sales from the reserve, presumably in a coordinated effort with America&#39;s industrial partners that also hold oil reserves.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I&#39;m prepared to take additional steps, if necessary, to insure that America stays strong here at home,&#39;&#39; President Bush said in a speech at a fund-raising dinner last night for a Senate candidate from Illinois.</p> <p>The Administration&#39;s decision to tap the oil reserve seems to have been motivated as much by politics as by economics. The sharp rise in oil prices during the late 1970&#39;s, political analysts note, damaged not only the American economy but also the Presidency of Jimmy Carter and the Administration seems eager to avoid a similar oil-related political setback, if possible.</p> <p>Commenting on the recent advance in oil prices, a senior White House official said last night, &#39;&#39;From a political point of view, as well as an economic standpoint, we cannot let this go on.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Earlier in the day, more than three dozen Republican and Democratic members of the House of Representatives urged the President to begin tapping the reserve. Citing the price climb, they said that &#39;&#39;it was for just such circumstances that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Coordination Urged</p> <p>The lawmakers urged that the United States coordinate the releases with Japan and West Germany, which have almost 400 million barrels in their stockpiles. &#39;&#39;Just as our military efforts require equitable burden sharing, so do our economic efforts to reduce the impact from the loss of oil,&#39;&#39; they said in a letter.</p> <p>The signers included Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Misssouri and the House majority leader; William H. Gray, Democrat of Pennsylvania and the Democratic whip; John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Norman F. Lent of Long Island, the ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce panel.</p> <p>The price of oil has approached $40 in recent days, more than double the level at the beginning of the summer, putting increasing pressure on the President to tap the 590-million-barrel reserve, which is in salt caverns along the Texas and Louisiana coasts, and was assembled over 15 years at a cost of about $16 billion. It is designed to deliver oil at rates of up to 3.5 million barrels a day.</p> <p>Net Loss of 1.7 Million</p> <p>In contrast, the embargo against oil from Iraq and Kuwait cut world supplies by about 4.3 million barrels. The Department of Energy said yesterday that because other oil-producing nations had increased their pumping, the net loss was now about 1.7 million barrels a day, and could shrink to one million barrels a day by November.</p> <p>The current global shortfall could be met by the reserve for more than 400 days, and if the global deficit fell to one million barrels a day, the reserve could make up the difference for nearly two years.</p> <p>But prices are at their highest levels since 1980, and in his remarks at the fund-raising dinner, Mr. Bush said there was &#39;&#39;no justification for the intensive and unwarranted speculation in oil futures.&#39;&#39; Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said that recent price rises &#39;&#39;cannot be explained by market forces.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The announcement, which was made after the close of futures trading yesterday, caused a price drop last night in the spot, or cash, market for oil sold for immediate delivery and is likely to depress the oil market at least briefly.</p> <p>At Cargill Investor Services, Arnold G. Stifel, a broker, said, &#39;&#39;We could back off a dollar, maybe $2 or $3. But that is not a whole lot, considering that we move so much daily. This market is so scared that these prices are going to hold.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Daniel C. Yergin of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said, &#39;&#39;This is more like a test drive, to demonstrate that it works.&#39;&#39; Mr. Yergin, the author of a major report on the reserve for the Council on Foreign Relations earlier this year, said in a telephone interview last night that &#39;&#39;there has been a lot of skepticism about how it will work physically, and in market terms.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Different From Imported Oil</p> <p>The oil differs in some physical characteristics from the kind of oil that the United States imports.</p> <p>Mr. Yergin added, &#39;&#39;You don&#39;t want to do a test drive when everybody&#39;s in a total panic, and have something not go right.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Some traders reached last night were skeptical that the test would have much value. &#39;&#39;I wouldn&#39;t expect it to have a big impact - I still think it&#39;s a fear market, not a supply and demand market,&#39;&#39; said Michael Wilner, the president of the Hilltop Trading Company in New York. The sale, he added, could &#39;&#39;get lost in the bigger picture.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Driving the market in the last few weeks, according to experts, is a desire by everyone who uses oil to increase inventories well above normal levels, as a hedge against future shortages. Pushing demand up at a time when supply is down, the result has been sharply higher prices.</p> <p>Expected to Happen</p> <p>Another broker, Andrew B. Shasha of Star Supply Inc. in Englewood, N.J., said that &#39;&#39;the sentiment has been that it was expected to happen.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But the White House is clearly hoping that the prospect of large new supplies hitting the market will depress oil prices, which are a big factor in the economy, and the economy is already weak. Figures released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday indicated that the United States was very close to a recession in the second quarter, before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent convulsions in the oil market.</p> <p>In his remarks last night at the dinner for Representative Lynn Martin, the Illinois Republican candidate for the Senate, Mr. Bush said: &#39;&#39;Today, it&#39;s especially important that America is economically healthy and militarily strong. At home and abroad, let me caution those who might take advantage of the current crisis in the Persian Gulf, those who might seek profit by subverting the sanctions or, here at home, those speculators who might try to drive up the price of oil.&#39;&#39;</p>
512828>U.S. Companies Settle Manila Reactor Suit The Philippines and two American companies yesterday settled a lawsuit involving assertions that the companies had paid big bribes to an associate of Ferdinand E. Marcos to get a contract to build a nuclear plant near Manila. One company, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, agreed to pay $100 million in cash and services that the Philippines characterized as repayment of the bribes. Westinghouse continued to deny that it paid any bribes, and pointed out that a Swiss arbitration panel that heard the case last year had found in its favor. And the settlement gives it a contract to run the plant and take a share of its revenues, leaving the strong possibility of profit.  <p>The other company involved, Burns &amp; Roe Enterprises, which was a subcontractor providing engineering and design services, was not required to make any payment of goods or services, and Westinghouse said Burns &amp; Roe would probably continue to work on the plant.</p> <p>In a complicated arrangement, the deal calls for the Philippines to invest an additional $400 million in repairs and improvements to the plant and for Westinghouse to repay $300 million of that to the Government, from its share of the revenues after the plant opens in three years. This payment would be in addition to the $100 million that Westinghouse is now paying in cash, goods, and services.</p> <p>Westinghouse, based in Pittsburgh, has supplied nuclear reactors for scores of commercial plants around the world, and performs services at many of them, but has never run one.</p> <p>&quot;The bottom line is, we got $100 million to deal with the bribery issue,&quot; said Mark Augenblick, an American lawyer representing the Philippines, &quot;and it&#39;s an arrangement which, with luck, will be in everybody&#39;s best interest.&quot;</p> <p>The plant will be brought up to the 1992 safety standards of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, he said, and electricity from the plant would be priced lower than power from any other sources available in the Philippines.</p> <p>Nathaniel D. Woodson, vice president and general manager of Westinghouse&#39;s energy systems business unit, said the $100 million &quot;has no relationship at all&quot; to the bribe allegations.</p> <p>&quot;We came up with a bargain we were comfortable with, that would remove a continuing pain in the teeth of litigation, which was not producing any electricity for the Philippines or any work for us,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s a bargain that allows us to get the history behind us, and if we can operate it well, we earn a further return.&quot; Breakdown of Payment</p> <p>The payment will be $10 million in cash, $75 million in nuclear goods and services and $15 million in nonnuclear goods and services, he said. Under the settlement, up to $45 million could be used to install solar power units to electrify up to 200 small villages. When the plant is running, he said, the company will get $40 million a year, plus 2.9 cents a kilowatt-hour.</p> <p>When the Government of Corazon C. Aquino took power in 1986, officials said that Westinghouse and Burns &amp; Roe had paid $80 million in bribes, and that the plant, on the slopes of a volcano on Luzon Island 50 miles northwest of Manila, was unsafe and improperly designed. Government officials also complained that it was near an earthquake fault.</p> <p>But Westinghouse stressed that the site had been chosen by the Philippine National Power Corporation.</p> <p>Burns &amp; Roe, based in Oradell, N.J., issued a statement yesterday describing the settlement as &quot;a complete vindication of its position that no bribery occurred.&quot;</p> <p>The plant, ordered in 1974, has cost $2.2 billion so far, more than twice what was budgeted. It has been virtually abandoned since Westinghouse left the site in 1986, shortly after Mr. Marcos was forced from power, and part of the work needed now is refurbishment.</p> <p>A jury had been selected Monday in Federal District Court in Newark. The civil suit was filed in 1988.</p> <p>Before reaching the American court, the case had been tried before the International Chamber of Commerce, in Geneva, as called for in the original contract. In December 1991 that tribunal said it had found no evidence to support the bribery contention.</p> <p>In suits brought against nuclear suppliers by utilities, a common coin in settlements is provision of services by the reactor manufacturer.</p> <p>According to Mr. Woodson, the hardware work can easily be completed in three years. What will determine the start-up schedule, he said, is how long it will take to train the operators, who will be Filipinos, Americans and others.</p> <p>COMPANY NEWS</p>
1827287>New Pay Plan For Control Of Air Traffic Is Proposed The Bush administration proposed Wednesday to eliminate the tax on plane tickets and air cargo shipments, shifting the cost of the air traffic control system largely to user fees and increased taxes on fuel. The proposal would shift some of the burden from airlines to corporate and private aviation. Because the plan would increase taxes on aviation fuels by 250 percent, even people who fly their own small planes would face higher costs, although they do not use air traffic control services so heavily.  <p>In the highly organized world of aviation, nearly every group except the airlines reacted negatively.</p> <p>The proposal would require approval by Congress, where the outcome is uncertain, though Congress is likely to take some action on aviation taxes this year because they are to expire on Sept. 30.</p> <p>The Federal Aviation Administration, which operates the air traffic control system, said its far-reaching plan would charge extra for flights in congested places or at congested times of day. And it asked for the authority to auction landing rights at La Guardia Airport in New York, to reduce demand to a level the airport could accommodate without delays.</p> <p>Marion Blakey, the F.A.A. administrator, said the proposal was &#39;&#39;first and foremost of benefit to passengers,&#39;&#39; but she did not estimate what the effect might be on ticket prices. She said a new financing plan was essential to developing and deploying her agency&#39;s new system of air traffic control, which is to be based on satellite navigation and surveillance instead of radar and radio beacons.</p> <p>But critics of the proposal, including groups that have wielded great influence in Congress, said that the plan was mostly a giveaway to the airlines, and that the agency&#39;s stated goal, tying its income to the level of operations instead of to the price of tickets, was not sound. Because the overall volume of flights varies widely, they said, user fees based partly on the tally of takeoffs and landings are less predictable than percentage taxes on fares and freight tariffs.</p> <p>In theory, the bulk of the F.A.A.&#39;s budget comes from a trust fund, into which ticket tax, cargo tax and fuel tax revenues are deposited. The fund is at a 10-year low, about $1.8 billion. In practice, however, Congress has always appropriated money to the agency from general tax revenues, and at times has granted more than the executive branch has sought.</p> <p>The F.A.A. is now also seeking the authority to borrow money to finance air traffic control. It envisions a 13-member advisory board, including four airline members, to consult on fees.</p> <p>In the last decade, the Clinton and Bush administrations have advanced proposals to move the air traffic control system toward privatization, an idea generally favored by the airlines. Non-airline users of the system argued that the proposal offered on Wednesday was another step in that direction.</p> <p>Today the main contribution of private planes to financing the air traffic system is a tax of about 21 cents a gallon on jet fuel. The airlines have been arguing that they pay nearly 95 percent of the system&#39;s costs but use only about two-thirds of its services.</p> <p>In one example, they say that a JetBlue Airbus A320 flying from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Washington pays $1,575, taking into account cargo, fuel and ticket taxes, while a Cessna Citation X, a large business jet, pays $87.</p> <p>James May, president of the Air Transport Association, which represents airlines, said he did not understand why there should be any difference in what two airplanes pay when flying the same route.</p> <p>But Ed Bolen, president of the National Business Aviation Association, said airline operations cost far more because airlines build hubs with extremely high traffic density, requiring far more equipment and air traffic controllers than are needed by business planes that fly to less-busy places and do not rush in all at once.</p>
1299929>New Focus on an Old Nuclear Problem The nuclear plant here split its first atom in December 1973. Both halves are still here. So is all the other fuel that the twin Peach Bottom reactors have used in almost three decades of making electricity. The same is true at more than 120 other nuclear power plants around the country, even though nearly 20 years ago their owners signed a contract with the federal government for the Department of Energy to take the fuel to Nevada for burial, beginning in January 1998.  <p>What to do with used nuclear fuel is a technical and political conundrum that is getting new attention as the Bush administration pushes for a greater role for nuclear power, while Senate Democrats say they will not agree to the longstanding plan to bury the waste at the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada.</p> <p>The problem will only grow as reactors built years ago seek license renewals to keep running for many more decades. Next month, the owners of the Peach Bottom power plant will apply to extend its operating license from the once standard 40 years to 60.</p> <p>Recognizing the storage problem, in the last few months Peach Bottom has set itself up to store its fuel on site for decades to come.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We never intended that Peach Bottom become a temporary storage site for used fuel,&#39;&#39; said James P. Malone, vice president for nuclear fuels at Exelon, the company that runs Peach Bottom&#39;s two reactors and 15 others around the country.</p> <p>But Yucca Mountain, the federal government&#39;s proposed site for permanent storage, was never a sure thing and is about to become even less so when Nevada&#39;s senior senator, Harry Reid, a longtime opponent of the project, becomes assistant majority leader.</p> <p>An engineer here who is now deeply involved in waste storage, Paul R. Rau, said that when he first went to work for the company that runs Peach Bottom 23 years ago, &#39;&#39;I would never have thought about it.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But the neat grid of 3,819 spaces at the bottom of a pool where the plant stores its spent fuel has steadily filled with fuel rods.</p> <p>So at this 620-acre site on the banks of the Susquehanna River, just north of the Maryland state line, Mr. Rau has built enough storage space to handle waste far beyond the expected lifetime of the reactors. The company built what looks like an exercise yard at a prison, a concrete pad two to three feet thick, surrounded by floodlights, motion detectors and two dozen cameras, with a double row of 10-foot fences topped with concertina wire. On the pad, which is the size of a football field, the company installed four casks last summer, each 18 feet high and 8 feet in diameter, each weighing 90 tons and holding 24 tons of spent fuel. This summer the company will add five more; eventually the total could reach 72, and even after that, the pad could be expanded.</p> <p>The casks, which could also be used for shipping, are designed to last at least 40 years. They are filled with inert gas to prevent corrosion, and require no mechanical cooling systems; David J. Foss, an engineer here who supervised their loading, said maintenance consisted mostly of inspecting them and sweeping the leaves off the pad.</p> <p>Peach Bottom&#39;s approach is typical. For now, the 103 operating power reactors around the country store their wastes in spent-fuel pools like the ones here, 40 feet on a side and 40 feet deep, designed to withstand earthquakes and filled with purified water. Since the fuel rods still generate heat, even years after being removed from a reactor, the water is needed to prevent meltdown. It also provides radiation shielding. But the pool requires additional systems: heat exchangers to keep the water from boiling away, and filtration systems to pick out the radioactive material that builds up in the water. Over the long term, corrosion and cooling are concerns.</p> <p>The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry&#39;s main trade association, says there are already 16 reactor sites with dry cask storage, and an additional 20 that will run out of space in their spent-fuel pools by the end of 2004 and will probably need such storage. Nearly all will need it by 2010.</p> <p>But it costs more than $1 million for enough casks to store a year&#39;s worth of fuel for one reactor. So Peach Bottom&#39;s operator, at the time the parent company of the Philadelphia Electric Power Company, was one of 12 utilities to sue the Energy Department to recoup its costs after the 1998 deadline; Peach Bottom, like other reactors, had been paying the government a tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour generated, in exchange for a government promise, now broken, to take the fuel.</p> <p>Peach Bottom settled, with the department agreeing that the plant could skip payments equal to the price of the casks. But this has not placated Exelon, which is highly likely to be a builder of new plants if any are ever ordered in this country. The company, like other utilities, would like the waste problem solved first.</p> <p>The cask storage sites have created a political role reversal: the companies that build them hate them, and the people who want to phase out nuclear plants see them as bolstering their argument.</p> <p>The companies are eager to empty them and have the Energy Department move the fuel, preferably to a federal burial site, but at a minimum to a centralized above-ground repository -- probably looking much like the one here, only bigger. For the companies, the casks are a reminder of an unresolved problem.</p> <p>But opponents are happy to emphasize that the problem is unsolvable, and that the waste should stay in its containers, right where it is, a reminder in five dozen locations that there is no permanent repository. Their goal is to convince the public that the reactors should stop producing waste -- in other words, that they should stop operating.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Their ulterior motive is to say that there is no solution,&#39;&#39; said Marvin S. Fertel, senior vice president at the Nuclear Energy Institute.</p> <p>But storing the fuel in casks is &#39;&#39;not a pressing problem,&#39;&#39; said Dr. Arjun Makhijani, the president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, a nonprofit group often critical of the Energy Department. Assuming proper regulation, Dr. Makhijani said, cask storage is quite safe, probably safer than Yucca.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;So long as the reactors are operating -- and this is not a plug for relicensing -- the waste should be stored on site,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Dr. Makhijani and others say that the government has proved unable to deal with its own nuclear wastes, from weapons production, and should not be trusted to find a burial spot that will stay essentially intact for 10,000 years.</p> <p>But other scientists like burial, and the industry contends that Congress will, too. &#39;&#39;If you don&#39;t vote for it, the waste stays in your state for 40 or 50 years,&#39;&#39; Mr. Fertel said. Under the language of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, any senator can introduce a motion to approve the project, and the Senate must then take up the matter.</p> <p>When the reactors now operating were designed, mostly in the 1960&#39;s, the builders assumed that reactors would store their wastes for only a few years before they were reprocessed for further use. One reprocessing plant ran for a few years in the 1960&#39;s, in West Valley, N.Y., but was a technical and financial failure. When Jimmy Carter was president, he barred a second plant, in Illinois, from opening. The Bush administration&#39;s energy report raises the possibility of reviving reprocessing, but experts say that technology&#39;s prospects are highly uncertain.</p> <p>Even if Yucca Mountain opens, it is too small; under the 1982 law it is supposed to accept 77,000 tons of civilian and military wastes, but the civilian wastes alone will come to more than that, partly because of license renewals, which were not anticipated in 1982. The industry hopes that by the time this becomes a problem, Nevadans will see the economic benefits of the repository and support a change in the law to accept more waste. But the other possibilities are lengthy storage in casks and the search for a second site, which no one wants to undertake.</p>
723268>Pollution-Control Efforts Zero In on Pleasure Boats Car exhaust has gotten cleaner and cleaner over the years, with catalytic converters and other refinements, but motorboat engines still have all the pollution controls of a &#39;57 Chevy. That would change under an accord announced yesterday by the Environmental Protection Agency. The E.P.A. said it had reached agreement with marine-engine manufacturers to cut smog-producing hydrocarbon emissions by three-quarters, a step that would help reduce the blue haze that sometimes hangs over lakes and harbors on summer days. Nitrogen oxides, the other major ingredient of smog, would also be cut sharply.  <p>The rules, to become final in about a year, after public hearings and comment periods, would be phased in from 1998 to 2006 and would require changes in the design of the outboard motor. The agreement leaves it up to manufacturers to figure out how to comply.</p> <p>Outboard motors, which account for about half of the 600,000 marine engines sold in a typical year, can release as much unburned hydrocarbon in an hour as a late-model car does in 40 hours, according to the E.P.A.</p> <p>&quot;The level of contamination is far greater than anything we ever saw in the automotive world,&quot; said Andre P. Mele, the author of a book on marine pollution, &quot;Polluting for Pleasure&quot; (Norton, 1993). The fuel that does not dirty the air, he said, stays near the surface of the water and interferes with the feeding and breeding of fish.</p> <p>The fraction of smog ingredients that comes from recreational boating differs from city to city; nationally, according to the E.P.A., it is about 3 percent of all hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. A 1991 study by the agency estimated that the figure is about 1.25 percent in Chicago and as high as 7 percent in Miami.</p> <p>Marine engines contribute about 5 percent of smog ingredients in New York State, said David J. Shaw, director of air pollution abatement at the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. The state must cut its output of smog-forming chemicals by about half in the next few years to meet air quality standards, he said, and marine engines are hardly the most obscure of targets.</p> <p>Florida has 700,000 pleasure boats, and the number is rising steadily, said Howard L. Rhodes, director of the Division of Air Resource Management, in Tallahassee. Replacing all the boats now in use will take time, he said. &quot;Like cars, there will still be clunkers that have been out there for 30 years. But you&#39;ve got to start somewhere.&quot;</p> <p>The announcement yesterday is part of a campaign by the E.P.A. to attack &quot;off-road&quot; sources of air pollution, notably pleasure boats, construction equipment and lawn and garden equipment. The boats are a high priority because their emissions are highest when the weather is warm and sunny, precisely the time when smog forms.</p> <p>Most outboard motors are two-stroke engines, like the ones in mowers and chain saws. They weigh very little relative to their horsepower, making them ideal for hanging off the back of a boat. But each time a cylinder fires, the engine expels the exhaust gases using a mixture of fuel and air, and some unburned fuel escapes with the exhaust.</p> <p>Experts anticipate that some manufacturers will gradually replace the current two-stroke models with four-stroke engines, the kind that cars use, which have a separate stroke to expel the exhaust gases. But others may try direct injection, in which the exhaust gases are forced out by ordinary air and then a computer-controlled fuel injector squirts fuel into the combustion chamber. That would add to the cost, but engines would start more easily, run more smoothly and go about 30 percent farther on a gallon of gasoline, engineers say.</p> <p>Most inboard motors, which account for the other half of boat engines sold, are four-stroke models; those will be cleaned up, too, but they are cleaner to begin with.</p> <p>It is not clear how much the changes will add to the cost, or whether that will be offset by fuel savings. But the major manufacturers agreed with the E.P.A. on a system under which they will reduce average emission levels sharply.</p> <p>Marine industry spokesmen said they knew some regulation was likely, given the ever stricter controls on automobiles, power plants and other pollution sources. &quot;Most of us got in the industry because we got in the sport first, and we depend on clean water and clean air or people won&#39;t be attracted to boating and fishing,&quot; said Jeff Napier, president of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, a trade association based in Washington. &quot;Basically, we want to do the right thing because our market depends on it.&quot;</p> <p>Ray Crawford, editor of the publications of the International Game Fish Association in Pompano Beach, Fla., said boat enthusiasts are likely to welcome the changes. He recalled backing up his Boston Whaler, with its outboard motor, and breathing the exhaust he usually left behind.</p> <p>&quot;To get into any dock you have to go into reverse and jockey around there,&quot; Mr. Crawford said. &quot;That&#39;s probably the worst time.&quot;</p>
204416>Ohio Stakes Nuclear Cleanup Claim Environmental officials in Ohio asserted yesterday that they had staked the first claim on the meager resources the Federal Government has devoted to repairing environmental damage at nuclear weapon plants.  <p>A Federal judge in Cincinnati ordered the Department of Energy to pay almost $1 million in penalties and costs to Ohio for radiation releases and other violations of Federal and state pollution laws at the uranium foundry at the plant in Fernald. The court order requires the plant to obey all such laws in the future or face contempt charges.</p> <p>State officials and other experts said it was an important precedent for cleaning up the nation&#39;s nuclear weapon production system, a complex of 17 aging plants in 12 states that have caused extensive pollution of water, soil and air. The plants are owned by the Energy Department, which for decades has ignored environmental standards but has begun to conclude cleanup agreements with the states.</p> <p>Experts also said a pattern of settlements around the country is beginning to set the priorities for the cleanup, which the General Accounting Office has estimated will cost almost $200 billion over several decades. It also sets an interesting legal problem, experts said, because the Energy Department was committing itself to activities for which Congress has not appropriated funds. Glenn Pleased With Order</p> <p>Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who heads the Governmental Affairs Committee, said at a news conference in Cincinnati that the court order went further than any other plan for cleaning up nuclear weapon plants because it involved the state in correcting what he termed &#39;&#39;35 years of sins&#39;&#39; by the Federal Government.</p> <p>The order, signed early yesterday by District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel, requires the Energy Department to pay $335,000 to cover Ohio&#39;s costs in supervising cleanup activities. In addition, the Government is to pay $128,000 to settle allegations arising from the release of radon gas and a gaseous form of uranium, and has been assessed a $525,000 civil penalty for earlier violations. The department is contesting the civil penalty.</p> <p>With the exception of the $525,000, the text of the order does not refer to the payments as penalties, and the Department of Energy has refused to directly link them to the radiation releases, saying simply that the payments were made to settle litigation brought by the state. But Anthony Celebrezze, the Ohio Attorney General, said that the payments clearly met all the criteria of civil penalties. &#39;&#39;If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call it a duck,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The order also requires the department to promptly complete an analysis of all waste streams and correct deficiencies in a plan for monitoring underground water; to stop discharging water from waste pits and a lagoon into a creek on the site, and to take a variety of other steps. &#39;We Are Making Legal History&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Celebrezze declared at the news conference: &#39;&#39;We are making legal history today. For the first time, a Federal Department of Energy facility will operate under a strict court judgment requiring them to comply with all state and Federal hazardous waste laws and meet proper groundwater, surface water and air pollution standards.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>He added that the state would &#39;&#39;oversee&#39;&#39; the cleanup. Officials of the Energy Department said, however, that while Ohio would play a major role, they considered the Federal Environmental Protection Agency the main regulatory agency.</p> <p>While state and Federal officials have not yet said what a cleanup at Fernald will cost, the bill is clearly larger than the amount budgeted. Senator Glenn noted that next year the Department of Energy would probably have only $300 million for cleanup in its whole system.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;That will about buy the blueprint paper and that&#39;s about it,&#39;&#39; he said, adding that he would push for more money.</p> <p>But Mr. Celebrezze said that with the court order, &#39;&#39;we would be put at the head of the line of any funding that is available.&#39;&#39; Hopes on Appropriations</p> <p>Shira Flax, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said such that agreements help win appropriations from Congress.</p> <p>A staff aide to a Congressional committee with jurisdiction over Department of Energy activities said, &#39;&#39;We think quite frankly that these agreements will facilitiate getting funding for these projects.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>At the Department of Energy, officials noted that they could not spend money that had not been appropriated by Congress. At the Oak Ridge Operations office, which oversees the Fernald plant, Jennifer Fowler, an attorney, said the department would not agree to an order like the one issued yesterday unless it was confident that funds would be available, but she added: &#39;&#39;If we don&#39;t fulfill an obligation and the state takes us back to Federal court, we can raise as a defense the unavailability of appropriated funds. We can&#39;t commit funds we don&#39;t have.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Still, she went on: &#39;&#39;We have a Federal District Court judge that fully expects us to meet the commitments. If we do not and the State of Ohio thinks this is some malingering on our part, we better not look him in the eye and say, &#39;Golly, we didn&#39;t even ask for the money.&#39; &#39;&#39;</p>
384237>Price of Oil Surges 6% In Minutes In a stampede that not even floor traders could explain, the price of oil rose nearly 6 percent yesterday in the last 10 minutes of trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  <p>Other Markets Affected</p> <p>Oil&#39;s bouncing price was felt in other markets: Stock prices ended lower after a rally was cut short, prices of Treasury securities moved lower and gold prices tumbled in trading that was completed before the oil-price runup.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, crude traded as low as $28.35, following the pattern of trading in London, where the market was apparently reassured by the weekend meeting between Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The trading range yesterday was thus $3.25, or more than 10 percent.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There was no news, no rumors, but everybody started buying,&#39;&#39; said James Fielder, a broker at E.D.&amp; F. Man International, describing the spasm at the close.</p> <p>Bandwagon Buying</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Everybody saw everybody else buying,&#39;&#39; said a trader at Geldermann, Mitchell Barber, &#39;&#39;and everyone figured that everyone else knew what was going on. Everyone jumped on the bandwagon.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Traders said that the market was now in an unstable configuration that would allow price movements, once begun, to march ahead quickly.</p> <p>Christian D. Gohler, a trader at Merrill Lynch Futures, said that the &#39;&#39;locals,&#39;&#39; or speculative traders, had taken &#39;&#39;short&#39;&#39; positions, promising to sell oil they did not actually have in the hope prices would fall. When prices began rising, they started buying to cover themselves and limit their losses, he said.</p> <p>In addition, many buyers had left &#39;&#39;stop&#39;&#39; orders, to buy a specified number of contracts if the price got to $30.50, or $31, or $31.50, said Mr. Fielder. As prices rose to those levels, more buyers came into the market, he said. And with prices rising, anyone who held a &#39;&#39;long&#39;&#39; position, obligating another market participant to provide the oil, was reluctant to sell because the price was rising.</p> <p>A Financial Creation</p> <p>Yesterday&#39;s movement illustrates the extent to which the commodity market is a financial creature, rather than a place to trade real, or &#39;&#39;wet,&#39;&#39; barrels. Price movements drew momentum not from any changing supply or demand for oil, but from the buy and sell orders of those seeking cash returns on oil contracts.</p> <p>The heating oil and unleaded gasoline contracts took their cues from the crude market. Some contracts had fallen by their daily allowable limit by mid-day, but were up at the close. Gasoline ended at 94.72 cents, up 1.66 cents, and heating oil finished at 85.89 cents, up 1.91 cents, both for October delivery.</p> <p>In his testimony yesterday morning, the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, a part of the Energy Department, raised the possibility of &#39;&#39;localized shortages&#39;&#39; of gasoline later this year.</p> <p>Minimum Gasoline Stocks</p> <p>The official, Calvin A. Kent, pointed out that gasoline stocks are near minimum operating levels. He said that while stocks &#39;&#39;should be adequate to see us through the fourth quarter,&#39;&#39; that &#39;&#39;does not preclude the possibility of some localized shortages.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Given a normal winter, no unusual refinery problems and no unusual building of inventories by consumers, supplies should be adequate, he said, if various producers are able to increase their production.</p> <p>But military activity in the Persian Gulf is raising demand for jet fuel by about 300,000 barrels a day, &#39;&#39;and problems could develop later in the winter&#39;&#39; in the market for that fuel, Dr. Kent said.</p> <p>While Saudi Arabia has pledged to supply fuel for the armed forces of other countries that have come to its aid, they have done this by reducing deliveries to other countries.</p> <p>Dr. Kent said the Energy Department had projected a shortfall of 1 million barrels of oil a day in the fourth quarter, which, he said, &#39;&#39;can be handled&#39;&#39; by &#39;&#39;conservation, both here and abroad,&#39;&#39; brought on by higher prices.</p>
413369>QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF NAVY REACTORS People who have worked for the Navy&#39;s nuclear reactor program, which has been quietly based here for four decades, have accused the program of serious safety lapses and say they were disciplined for raising safety concerns. Their allegations, denied by program officials, have contributed to pressure here and in Washington for wider scrutiny of the training and research centers, which make up the only branch of the Government&#39;s nuclear defense program with its secrecy mostly intact.  <p>Public attention to the nation&#39;s nuclear weapons complex, run by the Department of Energy, disclosed huge health and safety problems. But the Naval Reactors program, a stepchild of the Energy Department and the Navy and covering submarines and surface ships, has so far fended off efforts to lift its veil of secrecy. The complex of reactors here, where sailors are trained to operate the nuclear plants that power hundreds of Navy ships, are subject to little outside regulation.</p> <p>Standing incongruously on a 3,900-acre site in the woods here, 17 miles north of Schenectady and nine miles southwest of Saratoga Springs, are four submarine reactors. They are part of the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in Niskayuna, just east of Schenectady, where the Navy reactors are designed. Knolls, run for the Government by General Electric, also operates a reactor in Windsor, Conn., just north of Hartford.  Safety Record Defended</p> <p>Federal officials and executives of G.E. said the progam, both here and at sea, had an enviable safety record and no serious operating problems.</p> <p>But they acknowledge that this was impossible for an outsider to verify, because the records are classified. The classified records include virtually all the information on whether the program has suffered accidents, as four longtime workers assert.</p> <p>Two of those employees, who have since left the program, said the reactors had suffered several mishaps and that one was shut for two years after an accident that dumped radioactive material into a cooling system. General Electric acknowledged that there was a shutdown but said a radiation leak was not the reason. A spokesman would not discuss the details.</p> <p>The two men say there are several features of the Navy reactors that make them unusually risky. Unlike civilian power-plant reactors, the Navy reactors have no emergency cooling systems, the men say.  Sealed With the Reactors</p> <p>The Navy training reactors here, mock submarines looming in the woods, lack another safety feature common to civilian reactors. The civilian reactors are sealed in containment buildings and the control rooms are in separate buildings, making them safe from steam or radiation leaks.</p> <p>Here, the operators are sealed in with the reactors; a steam leak could kill the operators and destroy the reactor controls, critics say. If there were a pipe rupture, asserted John P. Shannon, one of the four men raising the safety questions, &quot;You blow out the bulkheads and annihilate the crew. Then you have no access to the controls, and you don&#39;t know if the reactor is melting down or still critical.&quot; Mr. Shannon is a former health and safety manager at Knolls; he contends he was demoted for raising safety issues.</p> <p>The Navy says that to get the most value from the training reactors they are built to resemble seagoing reactors, in which a submarine hull, in effect, is the containment building and operators, by necessity, work inside it. The system is safe, the Navy says, but critics say the Navy should follow the practice of the civilian industry and use computer-driven simulators for training.</p> <p>Mr. Shannon has also accused the Navy of failing to pay enough attention to the question of whether an unstoppable nuclear chain reaction would occur during a meltdown.  Lifetime Calculations?</p> <p>Acknowledging, in effect, that program officials did not know, a General Electric spokesman, Gerald E. Sabian, said recently in an interview that the calculations to determine if a meltdown would lead to an uncontrolled chain reaction would take a young engineer most of his career to perform. Mr. Sabian died in November.  Developments that have emboldened the program&#39;s critics in the past two years include radioactive contamination that program officials acknowledge finding in lighting fixtures and office walls, under a parking lot and in a building in Schenectady where General Electric once tested technology for making fuel for nuclear bombs. The building was later used as a food-distribution warehouse.</p> <p>In an interview in his Washington office, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, a graduate of the Navy reactors program who shares its supervision with the Secretary of the Navy, insisted that the program was exemplary. &quot;Naval Reactors wrote the book on effective oversight,&quot; he said. &quot;They have extraordinary checks and balances at all levels, and technical control by people who know the business.&quot; He said outside supervision by &quot;unskilled and untrained eyes&quot; would &quot;discourage honest reporting&quot; inside the system.  The Skeptics Grow Loud</p> <p>But here and in Washington, the voices of the skeptical are growing louder.</p> <p>Representative Michael Synar, an Indiana Democrat, requested an evaluation by the General Accounting Office, which is nearing the end of what it anticipates will be a 15-month study.</p> <p>On the Senate side, John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who heads the Government Operations Committee and was the main legislative force behind revealing the shortcomings of the nuclear weapons program, said in an interview, &quot;If there&#39;s one thing we have found in the rest of the nuclear weapons facilities, it&#39;s that secrecy bred corner-cutting that got us into deep trouble, and has bred contempt for safety and for waste concerns.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I don&#39;t see anything wrong with looking at the Navy up there with outside eyes,&quot; Mr. Glenn went on. &quot;If it&#39;s as good as they say it is, it will stand up to scrutiny. If it won&#39;t, we better be looking at it.&quot; Legislation sponsored by Mr. Glenn established an outside board to oversee much of the nuclear weapons complex, but Navy supporters amended it before enactment to exclude the submarine program.</p> <p>Gordon R. Thompson, director of the nonprofit Institute for Resource and Security Studies in Cambridge, Mass., is studying previous government statements about Navy reactors and the Navy&#39;s plans for a new reactor here. &quot;This is a nut that&#39;s waiting to be cracked, and it&#39;s a long overdue nut,&quot; he said. Scrutiny Doors Long Closed Start to Open</p> <p>Many critics say their best chance at some public scrutiny of the program is now, as the Navy seeks to install a prototype here for a powerful new reactor that would propel a new class of attack submarines, the Seawolf.</p> <p>At a hearing three weeks ago into the issue of whether the program should prepare a statement on a new reactor&#39;s possible effect on the environment, two grim-faced Navy men listened for more than two hours at the Holiday Inn in Saratoga Springs, while 20 residents of the area took turns expressing opposition to the new reactor.</p> <p>The hearing was scheduled after the Natural Resources Defense Council sued in an attempt to force the Navy to prepare such an environmental statement, which would open up many details about the reactor complex.</p> <p>&quot;The biggest nuclear threat to the American people has been that mounted by the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense,&quot; complained Tom Nattell, a medical researcher, who said he was speaking for a local activist group, the Albany Peace and Energy Council.</p> <p>In the hearing, Richard Guida, an official of the program, said the reactors were built to withstand battle shock and thus have characteristics making them less vulnerable to accident.</p> <p>If a new reactor is built, it would be constructed here, at the end of Atomic Project Road in West Milton. Flanked by two trailer parks, the road through the woods leads to a cluster of rusting metal buildings ringed in barbed wire and cameras.</p> <p>The program has a second laboratory, Bettis, operated by Westinghouse, near Pittsburgh, and scattered other units. Allegations Whistle-Blowers Or Whiners?</p> <p>Concern over the reactors is higher now because of allegations by Mr. Shannon, formerly the manager of industrial health and safety, who wrote an internal report in November 1985 describing what he said were botched efforts at asbestos removal. Among Mr. Shannon&#39;s allegations were that managers had falsely said employees were monitored for asbestos exposure and were provided with respirators. He was demoted and received unfavorable performance ratings.</p> <p>Mr. Shannon eventually left work at Knolls and sought a disability pension. A subordinate, Robert G. Stater, a nuclear engineer, quit in protest. The two men assert that the reactors, which are among the oldest operable reactors in the world, have had mishaps.</p> <p>But Mr. Sabian of General Electric said: &quot;These people are not whistle-blowers. They are people who had performance problems.&quot; They &quot;concocted&quot; their story for public sympathy, said Mr. Sabian, who was the Knolls manager of environmental health and security. In response, Mr. Shannon&#39;s lawyer said G.E. had applied to his client a grading system never used before or since.</p> <p>Mr. Sabian, who like Mr. Shannon had spent virtually all of his career in the Naval Reactors program, died on Nov. 11 of a heart attack. He was 55 years old.</p> <p>The interview with Mr. Sabian was conducted in a hotel lobby; few visitors are allowed into the Knolls complex.  Emergency Cooling Debated</p> <p>Mr. Stater and Mr. Shannon said none of the four reactors had an emergency core cooling system. Such systems are standard on civilian plants.</p> <p>Managers at the reactor complex have tried to add such a system to two reactors, but the job has complications, said the two men in an interview. One is that the metal of the reactor vessels is old and may be embrittled by years of bombardment by sub-atomic particles; many nuclear engineers are concerned that an emergency injection of cool water under high pressure could crack a brittle vessel.</p> <p>At Kesselring, Mr. Shannon and Mr. Stater point out, three reactors are in small hulls and the operators are sealed inside with them. The fourth is in a metal sphere that looks like a tank for liquefied natural gas.</p> <p>The reactors&#39; power output is classified, but calculations based on published figures for the horsepower of nuclear-powered vessels indicate that they are no more than one-tenth the size of a large commercial plant. Operators Assure Safety</p> <p>Officials of the Naval Reactors program said they did not consent to on-the-record interviews. In a written response to questions submitted in writing, officials said, &quot;All naval prototype reactors have engineered safeguards to help insure safe operation.&quot; They added, &quot;The stringent design requirements of naval reactor fuel, the conservative design of naval reactor plants, and the detailed training and qualification of naval reactor operators make the likelihood of a naval reactor accident extremely small.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Sabian said the reactors had safety advantages not present in civilian plants and were operated under close supervision. The reactors are designed to operate reliably for weeks at a time. But skeptics say that similar claims were made for civilian reactors before the accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986.</p> <p>Other reports of mishaps at the Navy reactor complex have been made by two other men with long experience, Frank Bordell, a radiation-protection expert who says he was dismissed for applying a new computer program to old records of uranium in workers&#39; urine samples and discovering excessive doses, and Douglas Allen, business agent of the International Union of Electronic Workers, who still works as a quality control inspector at Knolls.</p> <p>General Electric said that Mr. Bordell was using the new computer program improperly, and that by adding to workers&#39; records his calculations of their doses he was falsifying the records, a practice that the company said Mr. Bordell had been told to stop.  Reports of Mishaps</p> <p>One reactor, all four men say, was shut for two years so extensive radiation contamination could be removed from the steam turbine, a part of the system that is supposed to be clean. The reason, the men say, was apparently that a tube in a steam generator ruptured, a failure that can lead to a variety of hazardous conditions, especially in the absence of an emergency core cooling system. As in civilian plants, the men say, the steam generators show substantial corrosion, and many tubes have had to be plugged.</p> <p>Mr. Sabian denied that a reactor had suffered such an accident and would not discuss the matter further.</p> <p>In another reactor, a fluid leak made conditions in the core more favorable for a nuclear reaction, which threatened to cause an unintended nuclear reaction, Mr. Shannon and Mr. Stater said. And in one reactor, operators accidentally depressurized the core twice in one day, a condition that allows steam bubbles to form, all four men say. Such bubbles could block a water pump from working, or prevent cooling of the core.</p> <p>Mr. Sabian denied that either mishap occurred. He also vigorously denied that General Electric had harassed whistle-blowers. According to Mr. Sabian, the asbestos report by Mr. Shannon did not upset the company; rather, Mr. Shannon was performing poorly as a manager and asked to be transferred back to his old job. Questions What Is Known? Who Will Say?</p> <p>Adding to the overall dispute are charges of environmental problems and work-safety issues raised by Mr. Allen, the union official.</p> <p>Inside the propulsion laboratory at Knolls, radioactive contamination has turned up in an office building bathroom and in a records storage room.</p> <p>Knolls is not regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; the Naval Reactors program performs those functions for itself. It also lacks the independent review organizations that look over the shoulders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and civilian power plants, and many Department of Energy nuclear facilities.</p> <p>In their statement, Navy officials said, &quot;A self-regulating organization, such as Naval Reactors, which demands technical excellence and high standards, and employs strict discipline and encourages self-criticism, can do its job well.&quot;</p> <p>But critics -- most prominently, longtime employees no longer at the plant -- say that just as has happened elsewhere in the weapons complex, self-regulation has meant no regulation. &#39;Myth of Excellence&#39;</p> <p>&quot;They have created a myth of excellence,&quot; said Mr. Stater, who quit the program two years ago. &quot;But these are the only reactors in the United States that have no oversight. Naval Reactors won&#39;t even let the Department of Energy in.&quot;</p> <p>The struggle over information has at times taken bizarre twists. Aided by the Government Accountability Project, which represents Mr. Shannon and Mr. Bordell, workers sued General Electric over a &quot;security newsletter&quot; that threatened lifetime imprisonment for disclosing information without prior approval.</p> <p>The warning itself, issued in September 1988, was marked at the top, &quot;Not for circulation or removal from KAPL work sites,&quot; although officials of the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, which is known by its initials, said later that this label was excessive. After the suit was filed, the lab issued a second newsletter diluting the first. In May of this year it issued a third newsletter incorporating some of the same language as the first, and in June a fourth notice retracted the third, saying it had been distributed in error.</p> <p>Illustrating the degree to which security considerations pervade discussions of safety here, Mr. Sabian said that Knolls had been the subject of dozens of articles in The Schenectady Gazette in the last two years and that an adversary, by accumulating facts that were individually unrevealing, could piece together classified information. Asked if any classified information had been thus revealed, he replied that the answer to that question was classified.</p>
1611290>U.S. to Pay Fliers $1.5 Million for Pilfering of Checked Bags The Transportation Security Administration will pay more than $1.5 million to some 15,000 airline passengers who claim that items in their checked baggage were stolen or damaged in the last 18 months, the agency plans to announce next week. Since airport security was tightened after the Sept. 11 attacks, checked baggage has been handled by federal inspectors as well as airline employees. As a result, fliers reporting items stolen or damaged have found themselves in a kind of no man&#39;s land in which both the government and the airlines have refused to take responsibility for compensating them.  <p>Long negotiations between the two sides failed to resolve the impasse, because of differences in how the airlines and the government handle such claims. But on Thursday a spokesman for the security agency, Mark O. Hatfield, said in an interview, &#39;&#39;Passengers have been caught in the middle long enough, and the T.S.A. decided it&#39;s time to settle these claims, even in the absence of a long-term agreement with the airlines&#39;&#39; involving claims processing and the sharing of costs.</p> <p>The government settled some claims in the period before the negotiations began 18 months ago, but has paid few since; settlements have totaled only 1,800 in the last 22 months, in addition to the 15,000 the agency has now agreed to.</p> <p>The airlines have historically had problems with pilferage by their baggage handlers. But since June, more than 20 baggage screeners for the security agency have also been charged with stealing from checked bags.</p> <p>Since the agency&#39;s personnel began baggage inspections, which often take place in secluded, windowless rooms at the airports, passengers have complained about the loss of items as diverse as golf umbrellas, silk underwear, laptop computers and prescription painkillers, and about damage to cameras and other sensitive equipment.</p> <p>By passengers&#39; accounts, airline customer service agents tell them that the problem is security screeners, while security agency personnel blame airline baggage handlers.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The proverbial &#39;chain of custody&#39; has been broken,&#39;&#39; one airline executive said on condition that his company not be identified. &#39;&#39;The airline has possession of your bags when you check them in. But from that point to the point where it&#39;s delivered on the baggage carousel, it could be intercepted by the T.S.A. or a baggage handler.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Several stumbling blocks impeded an agreement in which the government and the airlines might have shared the cost of claims. Some airlines say they wanted a system in which they would have processed the claims, using their adjusters and historical databases, which can help track passenger fraud. They also wanted to know whom the government would be paying, so that customers could not try to collect twice.</p> <p>But government officials said that letting the airlines know who was receiving payments could violate federal privacy laws. And the government has stricter standards for paying damage claims than do private businesses, which often try to accommodate their best customers.</p> <p>In addition, airline executives say, the agency was trying to put a cap on its share of the payments.</p> <p>Jack Evans, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, an industry group, said, &#39;&#39;We&#39;re disappointed that we haven&#39;t been able to reach agreement with the T.S.A. on this, and we continue to encourage them to work expeditiously to reach settlements with our customers.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The security agency, its officials say, has finished processing 18,000 of a total of 26,000 claims. Not all those 18,000 will result in payments. Mr. Hatfield, the agency spokesman, said the government would pay the entire claim in 38 percent of the cases, half the claim in 33 percent, and less than half the claim in 12 percent. In the remaining 17 percent, the claims will be denied because the items reported missing were prohibited in the first place, like butane lighters or other hazardous materials, or because the missing item did not belong to the claimant. The agency is also denying claims for damage to locks, and damage caused by X-rays, mostly to photographic film.</p> <p>In cases where a payment is made, the average will be about $110, Mr. Hatfield said.</p> <p>A spokeswoman, Yolanda Clark, said the security agency was trying to make it easier to file a claim, by setting aside some specialists in its call center. Ms. Clark said the agency also hoped to have a Web page by the end of the year where passengers can enter their case numbers and see the status of their claims.</p> <p>One passenger with a claim, Dr. Thomas H. Crook III, a psychologist in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said of the $110 average payment, &#39;&#39;That&#39;s not much.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>This summer Dr. Crook filed a claim for a BlackBerry, a digital camera and European currency he said was stolen from a bag on a flight home from Phoenix in June. He said his loss was about $1,200, plus some items of sentimental value, including photographs. He said he was encouraged, however, that he recently had a phone call from a representative of the security agency asking him to send receipts for the missing items.</p>
140838>Profits Rise At 3 Big Oil Companies Texaco Inc., the Phillips Petroleum Corporation and the Chevron Corporation all reported much stronger profits in the first quarter yesterday, bolstered by chemicals and refining and marketing operations.  <p>The improvement in results were in line with those of five major oil companies released earlier this week, and continued to show weakness in exploration and production, the &#39;&#39;upstream&#39;&#39; end of the oil business. Texaco Earnings Double</p> <p>Texaco, freshly emerged from bankruptcy and facing a proxy battle at its annual meeting in June, announced first-quarter earnings of $242 million, or $1 a share, more than double its earnings of $118 million, or 49 cents a share, in the comparable period last year.</p> <p>Analysts said that the improvement was in line with their expectations, and that management&#39;s success in fending off a takeover would probably depend on asset sales, rather than the recent operating results of the company. Texaco, based in White Plains, is the nation&#39;s third-largest oil company.</p> <p>James W. Kinnear, Texaco&#39;s president and chief executive, attributed the earnings growth to &#39;&#39;the continuing upward trend in the company&#39;s quarterly earnings from the depressed levels of 1986.&#39;&#39; &#39;Volatile Crude Oil Prices&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Kinnear continued, &#39;&#39;Texaco has been able to achieve this steady improvement in its operating earnings over the last five quarters, even though the petroleum business remains highly competitive with extremely volatile crude oil prices.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Crude oil prices dipped below $10 a barrel in 1986, and have oscillated with unusual speed since late last year. Prices rose again in trading yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with a barrel of West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude oil, closing at $18.60, up 20 cents a barrel, for delivery next month. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries also began meetings yesterday in Vienna with non-OPEC members to consider a coordinated program of production cutbacks.</p> <p>The depressed oil prices have been good news for refining and marketing at all the companies. At Texaco, quarterly profits in the sector were $153 million, up from $6 million, in the comparable period last year. Exploration and production profits were up more modestly, to $248 million, from $204 million. Total revenues were $8.7 billion, compared with $8.5 billion. Capital Gain of $66 Million</p> <p>Texaco&#39;s results also included a $66 million capital gain on the sale of half of the company&#39;s 40 percent interest in an offshore venture in Angola.</p> <p>While the company&#39;s results for the quarter were in line with those of the industry as a whole, and its directors recently reinstated a $3-a-share dividend that prevailed before Texaco entered bankruptcy, more than that will be required to fend off raiders, said George F. Friesen, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. &#39;&#39;They need more than a dividend, more than promising asset sales,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;They have to deliver some significant asset sales.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A group led by Carl C. Icahn, the New York financier, is seeking to elect five members to Texaco&#39;s board at the June meeting. In a filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Inc. said it had been retained to help solicit proxies at Texaco&#39;s annual meeting for this year and next. Chevron</p> <p>Chevron, the nation&#39;s fourth-ranked oil producer, said that profits were up 81 percent, to $653 million, or $1.91 a share, from $361 million, or $1.06 a share, in the 1987 quarter. Its revenues rose 10.3 percent, to $7.5 billion, from $6.8 billion, because of price increases for chemicals and natural gas and higher volumes of crude oil and petroleum products.</p> <p>The San Francisco-based Chevron also posted an extraordinary gain from the sale of its interest in assets in Angola. Chevron sold 20 percent of a 49 percent stake in its exploration and production operations in that African country to AGIP S.p.A., the state-owned oil company of Italy.</p> <p>Chevron&#39;s net income from its American petroleum operations more than doubled, to $180 million for the quarter, from $78 million in the period a year ago. The prior year&#39;s earnings were restated because of accounting changes. The exploration and production component of its first-quarter earnings dropped this year, to $46 million from $124 million, the company said. Phillips</p> <p>Phillips, the nation&#39;s 10th-largest oil producer, said that it earned $130 million in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $32 million in the 1987 period. Sales rose 14.2 percent, to $2.9 billion from $2.54 billion.</p> <p>Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., also attributed its turnaround to higher prices and volumes for natural gas, and to moderately higher petroleum prices, as well as lower operating costs.</p>
713135>Government Says Court Is Impeding Effort to Ease Nuclear Threat The Energy Department said yesterday that a Federal judge&#39;s order blocking the department from importing spent nuclear fuel from European reactors was undermining the Government&#39;s effort to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons. The judge, Matthew J. Perry Jr., ruling in a suit brought in Federal District Court in Columbia, S.C., by the State of South Carolina, issued a restraining order on Tuesday that prevents the Energy Department from importing the rods. Two ships carrying several hundred fuel rods are already at sea, due to land within days at the Sunny Point Military Terminal in Wilmington, N.C. The rods are supposed to be shipped by rail to the Savannah River Site near Aiken, S.C., for storage.  <p>The Energy Department said it would appeal the judge&#39;s ruling.</p> <p>The rods, which were originally supplied to the European countries by the United States, are from research reactors and are much different from those in power plants. Unlike commercial waste, they are made of highly enriched uranium, which can be used in nuclear bombs; they are small, weighing only a few pounds each, and some are not highly radioactive, according to officials. A dozen, maybe fewer, would be enough for a bomb, officials said, although some chemical processing would be needed first.</p> <p>The United States has supplied such fuel to research reactors around the world for decades but in the last few years has been trying to replace the rods with new ones that use low-enriched uranium, which is not suitable for bombs. The Clinton Administration argued in court that unless the Energy Department could take back the old rods, operators of foreign reactors would not agree to swap them for the safer ones.</p> <p>&quot;Highly enriched uranium is a direct weapons-usable material, and it is unnecessary for these reactors to be based on highly enriched uranium,&quot; Charles B. Curtis, the Under Secretary of Energy, said yesterday in a conference call with reporters.</p> <p>But Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. complained in a letter to the Energy Secretary, Hazel R. O&#39;Leary, last month, &quot;It is not necessary to bring this waste to South Carolina with no long-term disposition in sight, while these foreign countries reap the jobs and benefits that come from nuclear research without paying the expense of handling their own waste.&quot;</p> <p>Tucker A. Eskew, the Governor&#39;s press secretary, said yesterday, &quot;Let&#39;s face it, these allies are stable allies, with the capacity to store this material safely.&quot; The reactors are in Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden. &quot;Having it baby-sat in South Carolina, with no long-term plan, solves no problems.&quot;</p> <p>The uranium could be diluted so it is unsuitable for bombs and then used in reactors, Mr. Eskew said.</p> <p>In an unusual twist, the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has considerable experience in suing the Energy Department on environmental questions, testified in support of the department in the case.</p> <p>&quot;It&#39;s our judgment that the benefits for international security far outweigh the inconsequential environmental risk of adding 409 spent fuel elements to the large quantity of nuclear waste at the Savannah River Site,&quot; said Jacob Scherr, a senior lawyer with the group.</p> <p>Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, said in a statement that &quot;acceptance of foreign research reactor spent nuclear fuel, including the shipments that are the subject of the court order, is a critical element of our nonproliferation policy.&quot;</p> <p>The two ships headed to the United States were loaded in France. They will meet in the Atlantic Ocean and wait in international waters until the situation is clarified.</p>
719122>Is a Takeover Good for Lilco? Three weeks before the vote in a tight election race, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has proposed a step no one has taken in 50 years, a government buyout of a major utility. Is it a good idea? It would certainly run against the current policy buzzword, privatization, as other states turn to private companies to run everything from their highway departments to their prisons.  <p>But the world of electric utilities has been turned on its head in the last few months, and many people -- including executives at the Long Island Lighting Company -- think Mr. Cuomo&#39;s bold proposal could work. The underlying reason is that Lilco may be on the edge of losing its monopoly, which for a high-cost utility is fatal.</p> <p>&quot;The situation in the electric power industry has changed dramatically in the last several months,&quot; said S. David Freeman, president of the New York Power Authority, at a press conference here this afternoon. &quot;This is the first time in the history of the power industry that a company like Lilco would seriously entertain a proposal like this.&quot; In 1988, in fact, Lilco turned down a government takeover offer (though the package was less attractive and the company&#39;s prospects were brighter).</p> <p>These days Lilco is living a corporate life of quiet desperation. With the highest electric rates of any major utility in the country, its large customers are shopping for new suppliers. If a few of them find those suppliers and abandon Lilco, the Long Island utility will have to seek even more rate increases to maintain revenues from a smaller base. That would drive more customers away, a phenomenon utility experts call a &quot;death spiral.&quot;</p> <p>But if a takeover is good for Lilco, would it also be good for Long Island&#39;s electricity consumers, and for taxpayers on Long Island as well as around New York State? The taxpayer piece is simple. There would be no impact on Long Island property owners. The legislation that created the Long Island Power Authority, the agency that would take over Lilco, specifies that the Authority would pay the same amount that Lilco would in local property taxes and state taxes.</p> <p>And while there would be some effect on Albany&#39;s tax revenue, since Lilco&#39;s bonds are taxable and the Power Authority&#39;s bonds would not be, the effect would be minor.</p> <p>As for the ratepayers, the effect is far less certain. Mr. Freeman, who heads the state power authority that helped develop the Governor&#39;s proposal, is counting on being able to borrow money at two to three percentage points less than Lilco does, because the governmental authority&#39;s credit is better.</p> <p>He also points out that a government-owned utility would not owe any Federal tax and would not have to pay dividends to shareholders. Financial analysts agree that this could produce savings for ratepayers -- Mr. Freeman believes as much as 15 percent. He promises the deal will not go forward unless it will save customers at least 10 percent.</p> <p>If it happens, it will be the first time in 50 years that a government body has purchased a major utility. That was the Sacramento Municipal District, in California, the agency from which Governor Cuomo hired Mr. Freeman six months ago.</p> <p>But some people doubt the ability of a government to run any large enterprise efficiently and say that poor management could swallow up those savings. The Power Authority has had to keep its Indian Point 3 nuclear reactor in Buchanan closed since February 1993 because of management problems. And even State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, said today that he had &quot;serious concerns&quot; about the takeover.</p> <p>Congress began setting the stage for Lilco&#39;s current troubles in 1990 when it passed legislation intended to foster competition in electric markets by letting customers shop around. In response, legislators in California earlier this year moved toward letting customers there pick and choose among suppliers.</p> <p>And in June, the Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, proposed that his county buy lower-priced power from other utilities. In such a scenario, Lilco&#39;s role would be reduced to delivering electricity produced by others. The Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, also said he had held meetings with independent power producers.</p> <p>Around New York State, power companies are confronting this new world of competition, along with technological and market changes that have reduced the demand for power.</p> <p>Lilco&#39;s problem is the most severe, but other utilities will face the same problems later, industry analysts say.</p> <p>Lilco&#39;s stock price is down about 40 percent in the last year, as are the stocks of many other utilities. Lilco&#39;s stock price was only about three-quarters of its &quot;book value,&quot; the amount of money tied up in plants and equipment.</p> <p>Long Island&#39;s energy problems stem mainly from Shoreham, the nuclear plant on which Lilco spent $5.5 billion. After years of debate over safety, the state and company agreed that the reactor would never open, but that customers would be charged as if it had. That added about 5 cents to the price of a kilowatt-hour of electricity.</p> <p>But the decision not to open Shoreham, according to analysts, turns out not to have mattered very much; oil has been so cheap in the six years since that decision was made that it is unlikely the plant would have saved much money, even if it operated reliably and suffered no accidents. What counted was Lilco&#39;s decision to spend $5.5 billion building the reactor.</p> <p>The state&#39;s ability to try new policy options in energy are much stronger than they have been in years, largely due to Mr. Freeman, who has a national reputation in the utility business for having rescued the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District.</p> <p>It does not hurt, of course, that this is the season in which Governor Cuomo needs some dramatic gestures.  THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: LONG ISLAND</p>
808794>Faucet Makers Will Cut Lead To Settle Suit AS part of an out-of-court settlement with an environmental group, eight faucet manufacturers have agreed to sharply cut the amount of lead their products contribute to water. The settlement is likely to supersede a less stringent voluntary standard developed by the plumbing-fixtures industry and public health officials just last year. The Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit group, brought the suit in California under the state&#39;s Proposition 65, a 1986 law that limits the introduction of toxic materials into drinking water sources. The companies agreed that 95 percent of their faucets would meet the new guidelines by the end of 1999. Faucets that do not comply will be labeled. The lawsuit is proceeding against three manufacturers that did not settle.  <p>Lead, even in small doses, has been recognized as causing brain damage, reproductive problems and other illnesses. Brass, widely used in plumbing, is an alloy that contains lead, which can bleed into the water. Some manufacturers use brass with a high lead content because when they cast it into molds made of sand, lead is needed to keep the mixture from solidifying too quickly.</p> <p>Under the settlement, faucets can contribute no more than half a microgram of lead a day to water, or about five parts per billion. A year ago, the plumbing fixtures industry, in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local public health officials, agreed to a limit of 11 parts per billion. Faucets that meet that standard are marked NSF, a reference to the organization that set the guideline. Some faucets had been shown to add hundreds of parts per billion to water, and consumers had no way to know.</p> <p>The eight companies that settled the lawsuit are American Brands (which makes Moen faucets), American Standard, Eljer Industries and a subsidiary, United States Brass, the Elkay Manufacturing Company, the Masco Corporation of Indiana  (which makes Delta and Peerless faucets), the Universal-Rundle Corporation, the  Chicago Faucet Company and Whirlpool (which makes hot-water dispensers). The companies that did not settle are the Kohler Company and a subsidiary, the Sterling Plumbing Group, and Price Pfister.</p>
599338>Winter&#39;s Lash Still Lingers Despite Thaw With the first balmy weather in months, the snow banks from the blizzard two weeks ago are gone or dwindling everywhere. But some effects of the winter in the New York region will linger longer: the brownish-reddish tips of salt-damaged evergreens, the sounds of schoolchildren still in the classroom at the end of June, and the depletion of bank accounts, both municipal and personal.  <p>Many municipalities in the New York region report that they used twice as much road salt this winter as the winter before, and as the most recent big snowfall has melted, it has washed salty water into the earth. It may not be obvious immediately, said A. Wayne Cahilly, the manager of the arboretum and grounds at the New York Botanical Garden, in the Bronx, but for some roadside trees around the region &quot;a lot of serious damage will occur.&quot; Damage to Trees</p> <p>The problem is that for trees, the first growth spurt of the year takes place in the finer roots when the soil temperature rises to about 42 degrees, a level that soil in the New York City area will soon reach. The roots absorb water, usually with ease because the water in the root cells has a higher mineral content than the water in the ground and the water flows into the cells to equalize the concentration.</p> <p>But for many roadside trees, Mr. Cahilly said, the water in the ground will have the higher mineral concentration because of the runoff of salty water, and the roots will be pickled. The problem is worse for trees on the downhill side of the road.</p> <p>And some roads may wind up in bad shape, too. New York City, with 18,242 miles of traffic lanes, counts on 35,000 potholes a winter but since the beginning of this year has been seeing them develop at twice the normal rate, said Joseph DePlasco, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation. For the year, the department is expecting as many as 200,000, which works out to 11 per mile, or one every 480 feet or so. Potholes tend to be concentrated on the secondary roads, which are repaved less often, have more cracks, and are therefore more vulnerable.</p> <p>The last storm created about 25,000 potholes, said Mr. DePlasco, and the city Transportation Department crews began filling them only last week, because the department was concentrating on snow removal. Another three weeks of work is ahead; the department planned to have 58 crews at work yesterday.</p> <p>The road damage was not so much the result of the depth of snow, he said, but the repeated pounding that the streets took from snowplows. Then the snow melted, seeped into cracks in the road and froze again, causing more damage.</p> <p>At about $16 a pothole, most of it for labor, the last storm caused about $400,000 in road damage. Snow and salt are not particularly good for bridges, either, Mr. DePlasco said, but the salt effect there is cumulative over years and years.</p> <p>Those costs will be shared, but some costs of the winter hit home literally, with dozens of seacoast houses across the region carried out to sea. There was also damage to beaches. The lighthouse at Montauk Point was about 300 feet from the Atlantic Ocean when it was built in 1797, but as this winter ended it was only a little more than 50 feet away and in danger of being undermined. A New Experience</p> <p>In North Hempstead, L.I., it had been so long since the last rough winter that in the town highway department &quot;some of the guys had never done any plowing before,&quot; said Benjamin L. Zwirn, the town supervisor.</p> <p>New York City has lots of experience plowing snow but did things this winter it had not done in the last 10, said Emily Lloyd, the Sanitation Commissioner. With the snowbanks frozen solid and the trash trucks all plowing instead of collecting refuse, the earth-moving equipment that usually covers the garbage at Staten Island&#39;s Fresh Kills Landfill was idle, she said. So her department loaded the bulldozers on flatbed trucks and hauled them to other boroughs to clear streets.</p> <p>The winter did not expose any major flaws in the city&#39;s snow-clearing operations, she said, but it cost the city several million dollars more than the $11 million budgeted for snow removal. It will also increase next year&#39;s budget, because by law the snow-removal budget is based on the average cost from the previous five winters. &#39;We Got Walloped&#39;</p> <p>The New Jersey Department of Transportation budgeted $7 million for snow removal for the fiscal year that ends June 30 and is now about $6 million over budget, said Jeff Lamb, a department spokesman. &quot;We&#39;ve been fortunate for the past couple of years,&quot; he said. &quot;This year we got walloped.&quot;</p> <p>Bergen County is only slightly over its $1.2 million snow-removal budget, but its budget runs from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31. &quot;The problem is that we don&#39;t have anything left over for November and December,&quot; said Quentin Wiest, director of public works.</p> <p>The winter had its high spots, though. On March 15, schoolchildren in Nassau County got their first snow day since 1987, said Dr. Joseph A. Forte, deputy superintendent for the Board of Cooperative Education Services. The 8,400 pupils in Danbury, Conn., got five days, but they will have to pay them back. Students in one of the two middle schools and one of the high schools will also be making up for a late start because of school construction last September, so they will be in class until June 30, two weeks later than normal and the last day they can legally be kept, said Jay Eriquez, director of personnel and administrative services.</p> <p>In Little Ferry, N.J., students lost (or gained, depending on the perspective) one day in December and three in March; they will pay them back in April or June, said Stacy Holmes, the school superintendent.</p> <p>Woolly adelgids, which suck on hemlocks, favor the cold weather of the last few weeks. But populations of gypsy moths and grubs will be down because of the sustained cold. Higher Heating Bills</p> <p>The big hit, though, was in so many pieces that it was close to invisible: heating bills. New York State&#39;s 7.2 million households spend about $3 billion a year for heat, and commercial establishments spend an additional $1.8 billion. But this heating season is running about 9 percent colder than last, meaning that people are spending roughly 9 percent more. In New Jersey and Connecticut, that means more than $700 million. In New York, that means about $40 per housing unit, but for a typical suburban house the extra cost could easily be twice that.</p> <p>Whatever it comes to, it is more than some people can afford. At the Nassau County Department of Social Services energy program, Frederick R. Weimann, the director, said, &quot;The biggest surprise has been this March.&quot;</p> <p>The program gives small emergency grants, usually $180. &quot;At this point in the year we expect to be caught up, but we are still getting more applicants than we can interview on a daily basis,&quot; he said. Calls for aid are up 52 percent over last year, he said. Shelters Filled</p> <p>At least those people had homes to heat. The Hoboken Clergy Coalition Shelter, in St. John&#39;s Lutheran Church, was busier this winter even though it is normally filled beyond capacity anyway. &quot;We&#39;re licensed by the state to house 20 people with an emergency capacity of 30,&quot; said the Rev. Marvin Krieger, the co-director. During this month&#39;s storm the shelter remained open around the clock and 36 people were given a place to sleep, he said. &quot;I tell the State of New Jersey that when any individual is homeless, we are always in a state of emergency,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But don&#39;t blame mother nature for the cold weather, said Charles R. Guinn, deputy commissioner of the Energy Office in New York. This winter was roughly average in temperature, he said, while the last two were abnormally warm. &quot;We haven&#39;t had a colder than normal winter since 1987-88,&quot; he said. &quot;People have become accustomed to warm winters.&quot;</p> <p>Joseph Nicoletti, the Commissioner of Public Works in White Plains, N.Y., made a similar point. In the past, he said, &quot;We averaged 15 to 20 winter storms a year, and this year, including the big one, there have been 13.&quot;</p> <p>If the region is back into a pattern of normally cold weather, that may not mean any basic changes in behavior for people, said Mr. Guinn of the New York energy office. But in the office&#39;s promotions this summer for attic insulation and weather stripping, &quot;we&#39;re not above saying &#39;remember last winter.&#39; &quot;</p>
1498045>Report on Shuttle Disaster Is Likely to Leave Important Questions Unanswered The report by the independent commission investigating the Columbia shuttle disaster promises to be wide and deep, but it will also most likely have some gaping holes. A month before the anticipated completion of the inquiry, the panel&#39;s chairman, Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., has often referred to the idea that there are &#39;&#39;no showstoppers&#39;&#39; to resuming flight with the three surviving orbiters, meaning all of the problems the board has identified so far are solvable.  <p>The implication of that unofficial conclusion, though, means that some profound questions could remain unanswered and even unmentioned.</p> <p>That conclusion endorses NASA&#39;s finding in the 1970&#39;s, at the end of the Apollo program, and was supported by President Richard M. Nixon. It is the very basis of the shuttle program: that a reusable orbiter strapped to booster rockets and an external tank can be reliably operated. And comments by the investigative panel strongly suggest that that concept will remain unchallenged.</p> <p>Yet it is the nature of the design that brought on two shuttle disasters and the deaths of 14 astronauts. Leaky O-rings in the boosters ignited the external tank of the Challenger in 1986. And foam falling from the external tank almost certainly fatally damaged the Columbia this year.</p> <p>Falling foam has been a frequent phenomenon on rockets, but there is usually nothing for the foam to hit besides the rocket itself; likewise, without a shuttle attached, there is nothing for a tongue of flame to burn if one escapes around a seal.</p> <p>The endorsements for the shuttle concept, in the 1970&#39;s and today, have had two additional, more subtle effects: freezing the technology and allowing time for age-related problems to develop in reusable parts.</p> <p>The shuttle&#39;s planners thought they were building a vehicle for 20 years, but it has already lasted that long, and NASA may stick with the design for 20 more.</p> <p>In contrast, the first three programs to carry astronauts -- Mercury, Gemini and Apollo -- took only 11 years combined. With disposable rockets, improved technology was rapidly incorporated.</p> <p>The reuse concept behind the shuttles, of course, allows the three main engines, 21 tons of high-precision machinery, to fly over and over. But the shuttle program is the only one to reuse engines that run on cryogenic fuel, according to experts. This appears to allow damage, like cracks in components of the fuel lines, known as flowliners, to develop slowly. The shuttle program was shut down for months last year after cracks were found, almost by accident.</p> <p>Similarly, metal balls that support the orbiter&#39;s liquid oxygen lines developed problems, and numerous internal e-mail messages between engineers discussed the deterioration of the so-called Stoody balls, named after their manufacturer. The investigative board may now focus new light on these devices.</p> <p>Reuse is also accompanied by a loss of proficiency. The shuttles fly so seldom that technicians have told members of the investigating commission that they have lost proficiency in some tasks, which they perform only a few times a year.</p> <p>Gen. Duane Deal of the Air Force, a member of the commission, said at a recent briefing that NASA had tried to adhere to quality standards used worldwide in industry. But, he said, in most industries a technician &#39;&#39;does something dozens of times a week.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>If NASA technicians prepare only a few launchings a year, he said, &#39;&#39;it&#39;s kind of a stretch to say that some of those principles apply.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In contrast, it is the launchings of disposable rockets that are routine.</p> <p>And the cost to put a pound of cargo in orbit is still $10,000, 10 times what NASA wants to spend. Unmanned launchings for the cargo that the shuttle now carries to the International Space Station would probably be cheaper, some analysts say, because the rockets do not have special features to assure that they are safe enough for launching people.</p> <p>Some of them, however, are statistically more reliable than the shuttle.</p> <p>Sean O&#39;Keefe, the NASA administrator, told reporters on Wednesday that NASA would &#39;&#39;comply fully without any equivocation&#39;&#39; with whatever recommendations the board made. But if it eliminates the foam hazard, as it previously eliminated the O-ring hazard, then it will have reduced the number of hazards by two.</p> <p>Admiral Gehman repeatedly muses in public about the &#39;&#39;unknown unknowns,&#39;&#39; the future foams and O-rings, and while the Gehman board may find a few in its investigation, all that can definitively be said about the two shuttle disasters is that they will have reduced the number of unknown unknowns by two.</p> <p>The number remaining is, of course, unknown.</p> <p>To judge from the public comments of board members, the report is likely to be an unusually public and frank discussion of risk in human spaceflight.</p> <p>One member of the board, Steven Wallace, on loan from the Federal Aviation Administration, has repeatedly said that flying on the shuttle is more dangerous than flying an airplane in combat -- possibly 10 times as dangerous, possibly 100.</p>
1623008>Candidates Preach Oil Independence to Unconverted Public Both major candidates for president want the country to be less dependent on foreign oil. But whoever is elected will face many of the same challenges that defeated attempts by three previous presidents who hoped for the same thing, experts say. With gasoline at $2 a gallon and American forces uneasily occupying the country with the world&#39;s second-largest oil reserves, the issue of American dependence on imported oil has come to prominence only intermittently.  <p>Senator John Kerry, the Democratic candidate, has promised to &#39;&#39;make this nation independent of Middle East oil in 10 years,&#39;&#39; in remarks that heartened energy experts who favor big changes in American consumption patterns.</p> <p>President Bush, who said in his State of the Union address last year, &#39;&#39;Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country,&#39;&#39; has argued that Congress should pass his plan to permit some increase in domestic oil production and modestly increase fuel efficiency.</p> <p>But experts caution that neither public attitude, economic conditions nor technology provide a clear path for any major changes in oil consumption.</p> <p>Public perception is a crucial stumbling block.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Energy independence does not rate as an issue,&#39;&#39; said John R. Boesel, president of Calstart, a nonprofit consortium of companies working on clean and efficient energy transportation technologies. When watching the debates, Mr. Boesel said: &#39;&#39;I just sit there at home just pulling my hair out. Can&#39;t somebody talk about oil when we&#39;re talking about Iraq? There&#39;s this conspiracy of silence about oil.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Nancy Hazard, executive director of the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association, said the war in Iraq and high gasoline prices were not enough to interest most drivers in changing what they drive.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You can&#39;t get people to make a change unless the thing they&#39;re going to is cooler, better or groovier than what they did before,&#39;&#39; said Ms. Hazard, whose organization sponsors an annual race of vehicles that run on alternative fuels.</p> <p>So far, rising gasoline prices do not appear to have had much impact on demand. In September, gasoline deliveries rose 1.8 percent compared with the same month a year earlier, when the price was about $1.50 a gallon. Diesel demand was up by even more. Demand for the biggest sport utility vehicles is off somewhat.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;People don&#39;t want to do anything different if they don&#39;t have to,&#39;&#39; said Richard R. Kolodziej, president of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition. He said the wholesale price of natural gas for the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline was still under $1.</p> <p>Neither Mr. Kerry&#39;s proposal nor Mr. Bush&#39;s plan is really new. In November 1973, during the Arab oil embargo, President Richard M. Nixon declared that &#39;&#39;in the last third of this century, our independence will depend on maintaining and achieving self-sufficiency in energy.&#39;&#39; He called for a program to reach that point by 1980. By April 1977, President Jimmy Carter had called on Americans to invent and conserve their way out of an energy crisis.</p> <p>And in 1992, after the Persian Gulf war, President George Bush signed a law that was supposed to nurture an alternative fuel system, so that by 2000, 10 percent of new vehicles would be able to run on something besides gasoline. By 2010, under the law, it would be 30 percent.</p> <p>In the intervening years, General Motors built a fleet of battery-powered electric cars but then retired them. Ford produced a selection of natural-gas powered vehicles but recently gave those up too. The automakers have produced millions of cars that are capable of running on ethanol or an ethanol-gasoline blend, but most run on gasoline. Ethanol is not universally accepted, because it takes energy to produce.</p> <p>Efficiency has, in fact, increased. For each dollar of goods and services produced in this country, consumption of oil and natural gas has fallen by 55 percent, according to the Energy Department. Consumption of all forms of energy per dollar of goods and services is also down, by nearly 50 percent.</p> <p>And car engines do far more work on a gallon of gas than they used to, by using fuel injection instead of carburetion, four valves per cylinder and other enhancements. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, if cars and other light-duty vehicles, like minivans, S.U.V.&#39;s and pickups, were the same average size today as they were in the late 1980&#39;s, and if they had the same acceleration, they would go 20 percent farther on a gallon of gas than the actual 2004 models do. But vehicles have gotten larger, with greater acceleration.</p> <p>And while shoppers opted for vehicles that were big and fast, they seldom clamored for anything that ran on an alternate fuel.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The big auto companies are interested in selling what they can make a lot of money on,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Kolodziej, of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition. &#39;&#39;It is much easier to sell gasoline vehicles.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Some experts say there are several changes that make a push toward energy independence more likely now. One is that worldwide demand is galloping ahead, and no longer driven by the United States, but by China. This has helped push the price of a barrel to a record in dollar terms, although not when adjusted for inflation. Still, experts say that the point at which global oil production peaks is uncertain but coming.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;re 10 years closer,&#39;&#39; said Dan W. Reicher, who was assistant secretary of energy for conservation in the Clinton administration.</p> <p>Mr. Reicher, who is an adviser to Mr. Kerry, said the effort to carry out the fuel diversification called for in the 1990&#39;s was underfinanced, but that Mr. Kerry was proposing billions of dollars to do the job.</p> <p>Another change is that in the decade since the last big push to decrease dependence, technological advances in various fields have offered promise for easing the fuel problem. One is in microelectronics, which has allowed hybrid gas/electric automobiles. Another is in biology, where gene-altered bacteria are used to produce alcohol-based fuels from agricultural wastes.</p> <p>But independence from imports, or even self-sufficiency, is not enough, some experts say.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The problem is oil use, not imports,&#39;&#39; said Amory B. Lovins, chief executive of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a consultant on energy efficiency. Mr. Lovins is a co-author of a new book, &#39;&#39;Winning the Oil Endgame,&#39;&#39; which describes technologies to reduce oil use in transportation.</p> <p>He has for years been predicting that a wave of new energy-efficient technologies will displace conventional fuel sources and thus lower demand. He said that eventually the United States would turn to strategies that would minimize oil use, and quoted Winston Churchill&#39;s adage that America could always be relied upon to do the right thing after it had exhausted all the alternatives.</p> <p>As for alternatives, he said, &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve worked our way pretty well down the list by now.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: ENERGY ISSUES</p>
1617627>Cheaper Part for Fuel Cells To Be Announced Today With oil near $50 a barrel, alternatives to gasoline are attracting more attention -- including fuel cells, devices that convert hydrogen into electric current with no waste products except heat and pure water. Fuel cells have found their way into power systems for laptop computers and into many experimental cars. The main drawback to automotive use of fuel cells, though, has been their cost, which at $100,000 can be 25 times the $4,000 for a gasoline engine of equal power. Lately, some companies, including Honda, have been trying to come up with cheaper versions of the most expensive part of a fuel cell: the membrane that takes the hydrogen fuel and separates it into protons and electrons.  <p>This morning, a California company, PolyFuel, plans to announce that it has achieved a breakthrough in fuel-cell membranes by using an alternative material: a hydrocarbon that it says costs only about half as much per square meter.</p> <p>Compared with the fluorine compounds that are the most commonly used for membranes in fuel cells now under testing, PolyFuel says that hydrocarbon membranes allow production of more electricity per square centimeter of membrane. That could mean that a fuel cell could produce the same power as a fluorine-membrane version, but would be smaller and lighter, further adding to efficiency, according to the company.</p> <p>PolyFuel is quick to say that it has not moved the fuel cell to the point of commercial viability, but now hopes to be closer to that goal. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re on a great trajectory here to continue to improve state of the art,&#39;&#39; said Jim Balcom, the company&#39;s president and chief executive.</p> <p>Hydrocarbon membranes can also run under a wider range of temperatures, and thus allow better performance, he said. But he acknowledged that other drawbacks to fuel cells would still need to be resolved -- including the logistics of producing hydrogren and transporting it to electric-car filling stations. The hydrogen molecule is so small that it would escape through the cracks in the pipes used for natural gas. And it is so light that it must be pumped up to extreme pressures to transport more than a few pounds by tanker truck -- requiring more expensive pumps and tanks than are currently in use.</p> <p>While some other experts say they are skeptical of some of PolyFuel&#39;s claims, a variety of companies, including Honda, which builds prototype fuel-cell cars, are doing work in the area. Gore, the chemical company, has done work on membranes that include hydrocarbons.</p> <p>The dominant membrane for the fuel cells now in use is a fluorine-based DuPont product called Nafion, which was developed for use in the chemical industry. It is chemically related to Teflon, which DuPont makes. Nafion and other membranes look like plastic food wrap, but are thicker.</p> <p>According to Mr. Balcom, Nafion will let enough protons slip through to generate about 6.5 kilowatts a meter, but his membrane will generate current of more than 7 kilowatts. (A kilowatt -- a thousand watts -- would run a single window air-conditioner. A car would require 50 to 75 kilowatts.)</p> <p>Honda demonstrated a fuel-cell car with a hydrocarbon membrane in Japan in October 2003, according to Ben Knight, vice president for research and development of Honda&#39;s American subsidiary. It has 12 such cars on the road in California and plans to put one in the Northeastern United States soon. A hydrocarbon membrane functions well at temperatures slightly below zero degrees Fahrenheit, he said. Fluorine-based membranes can produce very little power at such low temperatures.</p> <p>In addition, it can tolerate temperatures near the boiling point, substantially hotter than the fluorocarbon membrane, both men said. This is important because fuel cells generate heat that must be dissipated, and getting rid of heat from a system at 200 degrees is easier than cooling off a device that is already closer to the temperature of ordinary air.</p> <p>Mr. Balcom said that hydrocarbon membranes also require less humid air, allowing for simpler equipment within the fuel cell.</p> <p>Skeptics of some of PolyFuel&#39;s claims include Scott G. Ehrenberg, the chief technology officer of Dais-Analytic, a Florida maker of hydrocarbon membranes. He said that operating the membranes too close to water&#39;s boiling point risked surpassing that point -- as when a driver quickly accelerated. If the water turned to steam it would tear holes in the membrane, he said.</p> <p>But he acknowledged the economic importance of cheaper membranes because they can represent nearly half the cost of the fuel cell. In a car, he said, the membranes would require replacement every year or so, the way existing cars require oil and spark plug changes.</p> <p>Mr. Ehrenberg suggested another advantage to hydrocarbon membranes: they are already mass produced. His company sells millions of square feet of hydrocarbon membranes every year, he said, not for fuel cells but primarily for use in raising the efficiency of commercial air-conditioning systems.</p> <p>In a commercial building, the ventilation system draws in warm, moist air, chills and dries it, and pumps it inside, and exhausts air that is cool and dry. With a hydrocarbon membrane between those two air flows, the dry air on its way out can suck humidity out of the fresh air on the way in, reducing the workload for the air-conditioner, Mr. Ehrenberg said.</p> <p>People pursuing hydrocarbon membranes as a cost-cutting measure are &#39;&#39;barking up the correct tree,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>TECHNOLOGY</p>
743802>Big Airlines to Monitor Safety at Little Ones The Federal Aviation Administration and the airlines are exploring ways to restore confidence in air travel after a series of crashes. A simple idea that is gaining momentum is making the big carriers supervise safety at the little commuter airlines that feed them passengers. Those commuter lines have long been a source of confusion, according to some aviation officials. Because the airlines have similar names, and the name-brand carrier sells tickets on the little planes, passengers, not surprisingly, tend to think that the commuter line is part of the big carrier.  <p>That is not exactly the case. The Delta Connection, for example, comprises four airlines that most passengers have never heard of: Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Com air Holdings, Skywest Airlines and Business Express Airlines. Delta owns 20 percent of each of the first three and none of the fourth.</p> <p>Commuter affiliates like these should be overseen by the big carriers they are associated with, the safety board said in November, and the Federal Aviation Administration said the same last month at a two-day safety conference. The paying passenger should get the &quot;same level of safety regardless of which type of service he&#39;s on,&quot; said the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, James E. Hall.</p> <p>Delta, in fact, announced last month that by March 31 it would formally institute what has been an informal safety program, and others are expected to follow suit.</p> <p>Although safety experts say this is a worthwhile step, it is not a cure-all. Pilots at American Eagle, for example, are trained in the same program as those at American Airlines, although the commuter line lost an ATR-72 on Oct. 31 in Roselawn, Ind., in a crash that killed all 68 aboard, and suffered another crash on Dec. 14 of a smaller plane on approach to Raleigh-Durham.

1586046>Report Links Oil Mergers To Slight Rise in Gas Prices An extensive series of oil company mergers in the 1990&#39;s reduced competition in gasoline sales, but the resulting changes in wholesale prices were small, the General Accounting Office said on Thursday. The report comes at a time of high gasoline prices and renewed suspicion of whether oil companies are making unfair profits, but the study failed to find any significant effect from consolidation in the industry.  <p>The study covered 1990 to 2000, and of eight mergers studied, six led to price increases, averaging 1 to 2 cents a gallon, according to the report, and two resulted in decreases of about a penny a gallon. The biggest increase was 5 cents a gallon, said the report, which was prepared by Congressional auditors at the request of Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The preponderance of price increases over decreases indicates that the market power effects, which tend to increase prices, for the most part outweighed the efficiency effects, which tend to decrease prices,&#39;&#39; the report said. &#39;&#39;Market power&#39;&#39; is an economist&#39;s term for the ability to limit competition and thus sell gasoline above competitive prices.</p> <p>Senator Levin requested the study in May 2001, when retail gasoline prices reached a peak of about $1.73 a gallon. That was about 25 cents higher than at the beginning or end of that year. Regular gasoline is now selling for just more than $2.05 a gallon on average, according to the AAA.</p> <p>Mr. Levin has questioned for years whether lack of competition was driving prices higher. He had no comment on Thursday, his office said.</p> <p>The study also said that the mergers might have reduced the ability of new companies to come into the markets but said that the data to answer that question did not exist.</p> <p>The mergers may also have reduced the amount of &#39;&#39;unbranded&#39;&#39; gasoline, or gasoline sold under names other than that of major national companies, which is generally less expensive, the study said.</p> <p>The report indicated that large companies have closed some refineries and now have only enough capacity to serve their own needs.</p> <p>It added that in some cases these companies had decided to sell gasoline only in large quantities, freezing out small buyers. But the authors said that the data available to them did not allow them to determine the extent of the effect on prices.</p> <p>Price increases were driven by many factors, including the level of demand and of inventory, and the amount of refinery capacity available, the report said.</p> <p>The Federal Trade Commission, which reviews proposed mergers to ensure that they do not reduce competition, said that the analysis by the accounting office was flawed.</p> <p>The two agencies have been trading letters since last August about the proper way to conduct such a study, with the chairman of the commission saying that the accounting office&#39;s study was &#39;&#39;so flawed that reliable judgments cannot be formed regarding the competitive effects of mergers in the petroleum industry.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But the commission and the accounting office, which did not make any recommendations, disagreed about how the study was conducted.</p> <p>The American Petroleum Institute, the industry&#39;s main trade group, pointed to the commission&#39;s objections to the study.</p> <p>The commission, it said, is &#39;&#39;the independent agency fully staffed with experts to deal with these issues.&#39;&#39;</p>
1600683>High Accident Risk Is Seen In Atomic Waste Project An Energy Department plant under construction in Hanford, Wash., that is designed to remove highly radioactive waste from leaking tanks and immobilize it in glass has a 50 percent chance of a major accident over its 28-year lifetime, according to an independent government audit. The audit, which drew little notice when issued three years ago by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, has recently gained prominence through the efforts of Robert Alvarez, an adviser to the energy secretary in the Clinton administration.  <p>The regulatory commission, whose report cited several design problems, was the last outside agency to perform an in-depth engineering review of the project. Since then, the Energy Department has altered the design, and has also sped construction in an effort to cut decades and tens of billions of dollars off the cost of solidifying the waste, which is left over from half a century of nuclear weapons production.</p> <p>In a second report, however, the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional auditing agency formerly known as the General Accounting Office, criticized the department earlier this month for carrying out major construction before the design is complete, a risky technique called fast-tracking. The plant &#39;&#39;departs from conditions appropriate for fast-track management,&#39;&#39; the G.A.O. said.</p> <p>The Energy Department maintains that it has resolved the design problems and that it has no alternative to fast-tracking the project if it is to meet its promises, issued to the State of Washington and the Environmental Protection Agency in signed agreements, to empty the tanks into glass canisters by 2028.</p> <p>Plans are for the factory, which the department hopes to open in 2011, to use technologies that have never been demonstrated on so broad a scale. It is to carry on a process called vitrification, in which the wastes, some of which will be radioactive for millions of years, are dissolved in an extra-strong form of glass and poured into steel canisters, which are then welded shut.</p> <p>The plan is to bury the canisters eventually at Yucca Mountain, Nev., in a &#39;&#39;glassified&#39;&#39; form that is far more stable than the salts, sludges and liquids in 177 underground tanks now at the Hanford nuclear reservation. Many of those tanks have leaked, and some have oozed waste into the Columbia River.</p> <p>But Mr. Alvarez, the former adviser to the Energy Department, said that the plant would have as much radioactive material inside as a nuclear reactor and that &#39;&#39;the likelihood of it getting out is much greater.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Alvarez is the author of a paper on Hanford that has been accepted for publication by Science and Global Security, a peer-reviewed journal at Princeton. In an interview, he referred to the Hanford cleanup as &#39;&#39;perhaps the most expensive, complex and risky environmental project in the United States.&#39;&#39; He said he was unable to determine what changes the Energy Department had made since the regulatory commission&#39;s report that would reduce the risk of a major accident at Hanford.</p> <p>Roy J. Schepens, manager of the Office of River Protection, an Energy Department unit in Richland, Wash., that is in charge of the waste tanks and the vitrification project, said the commission&#39;s conclusions about the chances of a major accident concerned previous efforts at the site by a private company, BNFL, formerly British Nuclear Fuels Limited.</p> <p>When BNFL&#39;s price estimate rose to $14 billion from $3.2 billion, the Energy Department dropped that company and hired another, Bechtel National, to build the plant as a government-owned project. The commission, which generally regulates only private facilities, then left the site.</p> <p>Responding to the most recent criticism, by the Government Accountability Office, John Britton, a spokesman for Bechtel National, acknowledged construction problems, including improper testing of a stainless-steel tank that is supposed to hold liquid used in scrubbing the gas given off by heated waste.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We had some quality-assurance issues with the vendor,&#39;&#39; Mr. Britton said, though adding that construction was going well.</p> <p>Mr. Schepens, the Energy Department official, pointed out that a Congressionally created independent body, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, monitored Hanford. He also said there had been many design improvements since the regulatory commission&#39;s audit.</p> <p>Among them are plans for hardware that would limit the flow of radioactive waste into the glass; water in the waste can cause steam explosions when hitting molten glass. Another change is continuous mixing of the wastes and venting the tanks where it is stored, to get rid of hydrogen, an explosive gas produced by radiation in the tanks.</p> <p>Mr. Schepens said the risk of an accident at the plant would be comparable to that at a civilian reactor, though Mr. Alvarez pointed out that the department had a history of melter accidents.</p> <p>The cost of the project undertaken by Bechtel National has risen to $5.7 billion, a third more than the estimate. One reason is that the Energy Department decided to make the plant bigger so it could get the vitrification done more quickly. Another is that trying to build the plant while it was still under design caused costly delays.</p> <p>The accountability office said it feared that the department might end up with a plant that could not treat all the waste. In fact, the department built a vitrification plant in South Carolina in the 1990&#39;s to deal with similar wastes and is still trying to resolve operating problems there. One of the problems is hydrogen gas in the system that prepares waste for the melter.</p> <p>In a letter to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said the regulatory commission&#39;s estimate of the accident risk was &#39;&#39;quite startling.&#39;&#39; The senator said that &#39;&#39;it is not at all clear how and if D.O.E. has responded to the N.R.C.&#39;s findings regarding safety issues at the waste treatment plant.&#39;&#39;</p>
1376638>Big Hopes for Gas From Gasoline Like a salesman at a party supply store, a technician at the Ztek lab here gently unfolded a Mylar balloon and inserted a little plastic hose to fill it with a gas that made it float stiffly at the end of a string. But the gas was not helium, it was hydrogen. Even more odd was the source: gasoline.  <p>Ztek&#39;s balloons were not for birthday parties but part of a demonstration of making hydrogen for fuel cells, which use that fuel to make electricity.</p> <p>After 19 years of research and development, the company, a privately held start-up, says its process can help put pollution-free cars on the street, and it hopes to sell its first hydrogen-making machines soon. [In fact, the State of Connecticut announced Wednesday that it had chosen Ztek as part of a demonstration project that the company hopes will be worth $500,000.]</p> <p>Ztek is the latest entry in a race toward a widely sought goal, a way to manufacture nature&#39;s simplest molecule, two hydrogen atoms, so it can be delivered to a fuel cell. Fuel cells are highly efficient, almost silent and emission free, making them potentially tremendously attractive for powering cars and other vehicles.</p> <p>President Bush seemed to accept  some of that vision in February, when he kicked the tires of a hydrogen-powered Chrysler Town and Country minivan at an event on the South Lawn of the White House. &#39;&#39;Fuel cells will power cars with little or no waste at all,&#39;&#39; Mr. Bush said.</p> <p>But there are plenty of complications. Current processes for making hydrogen are cumbersome or not very efficient or both. The fuel does not exist in nature, and turns out to be rather hard to find in industry, too. While oil refineries make hydrogen, for use in the refining process, the molecule is so small that it would escape from conventional  pipelines.</p> <p>Environmentalists argue that hydrogen can be made using renewable sources, especially solar power cells. The low-voltage direct current they produce is perfect for cooking water (H2 O) into hydrogen and oxygen. The environmentalists can imagine fields of solar cells in deserts, creating hydrogen for fleets of fuel cell vehicles. But, at the moment solar cells are expensive, and there is no efficient way to get vast amounts of remotely produced hydrogen to service stations.</p> <p>And there is, said the manager of the fuel cell program at one automaker, also a &#39;&#39;chicken and egg&#39;&#39; problem: no one will want to buy fuel cell cars until the fuel is available, and no one will market the fuel until there are customers driving cars that use it.</p> <p>At the moment, no one can make a fuel cell at a competitive cost, but the fuel cell people look at hydrogen production as the problem. In that field, &#39;&#39;the technology development hasn&#39;t kept pace with the desires,&#39;&#39; said Robert Rose, director of the United States Fuel Cell Council, a trade group. There also is another cost problem. A new book, &#39;&#39;Tomorrow&#39;s Energy: Hydrogen, Fuel Cells and the Prospects for a Cleaner Planet,&#39;&#39; by Peter Hoffmann, (M.I.T. Press, 2001) puts the cost of hydrogen at anywhere from 40 percent as expensive as gasoline to almost four times as much, per unit of energy, although the fuel cell might get more work out of each unit of energy.</p> <p>Enter Ztek. Its product so far is a prototype, which lives in the back of a small panel truck so it can be hauled around for demonstrations. The full-size unit would fill a bay in a service station.</p> <p>The company&#39;s projections of cost and efficiency are imprecise, since there is no standard estimate of how many cubic feet of gas a typical car would consume. But Michael S. S. Hsu, Ztek&#39;s president and chief executive, said that the bay-size unit could convert 10 gallons of gasoline into about 4,000 cubic feet of hydrogen each hour. Running around the clock, this would be enough to give 30 to 40 cars a day their weekly fill-up. The company believes it could produce the units for $300,000 each if it had enough orders to reach a steady level of production.</p> <p>The $300,000 is far from attractive commercially, but Dr. Hsu says it could be used to support a fleet as a demonstration. It is too soon to say if the technology will catch on, but it could offer a kick-start to the hydrogen vehicle business.</p> <p>In the prototype device, gasoline runs over a material that acts as a catalyst. In a high-temperature chemical reaction, the gasoline is broken down into hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.</p> <p>The company has a longer-term plan that would produce far more hydrogen than was in the gasoline originally. The plan would bundle the reformer, the part that converts other chemicals into hydrogen, with a fuel cell, a high-temperature model called a solid oxide cell. The solid oxide cell runs at about 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,800 degrees Fahrenheit). The waste heat can be used to heat the carbon monoxide, which is then mixed with water. There, the carbon monoxide reacts with the water, or H2 O, stealing an oxygen atom to become carbon dioxide. The H2 O, robbed of the O, becomes hydrogen gas.</p> <p>Dr. Hsu said that by linking the reformer to the fuel cell, &#39;&#39;the energy required for the reformer is free.&#39;&#39; And the carbon dioxide could potentially be brought off in a separate stream, allowing it to be sequestered. The electricity from the solid oxide cell would be used to pressurize the hydrogen, for delivery to cars. The system, he said, would use up only 15 percent of the energy in the gasoline.</p> <p>Since a fuel cell will push a car more than twice as far on a unit of energy than an internal combustion engine will, this would still allow substantial gains in efficiency.</p> <p>[The Connecticut project announced Wednesday also involves a fuel cell and a reformer, but the main product will be electricity, not hydrogen; it will produce only as much hydrogen as the fuel cell will consume.]</p> <p>When Dr. Hsu began work, his approach was seen as radical, because the advocates of fuel cells were focusing on &#39;&#39;on-board reformers,&#39;&#39; essentially small refineries that would fit under the hood and convert natural gas, methanol or gasoline to hydrogen for immediate use.</p> <p>This made it easier to store the hydrogen, but also made a car that was tremendously complex and costly. And its inefficiency and the pollutants from the process of making hydrogen tended to cancel out the fuel cell&#39;s advantages.</p> <p>In the last few years, though, mainstream thinking has moved in Dr. Hsu&#39;s direction.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The auto industry and most of the oil industry would be extremely enthusiastic if a system were developed,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Rose of the Fuel Cell Council. &#39;&#39;It would make their lives easier.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>TECHNOLOGY</p>
1529908>Flaw Is Found In Plan to Bury Nuclear Waste The Energy Department&#39;s design for burying nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, near Las Vegas, would cause corrosion that would perforate the waste containers and allow leaks, an expert panel is preparing to advise the department. Nuclear waste gives off heat as well as radiation, and the Energy Department is considering taking advantage of that, by spacing the waste containers closely. That would heat the tunnels to nearly 300 degrees Fahrenheit in the first few decades, a factor that, the department says, would keep the metal dry and thus prevent corrosion.  <p>But the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, a panel created by Congress to advise the department, believes otherwise, according to a letter the members have drafted. Members said changes to the letter were possible before it is submitted to the department, but the draft, circulated on Monday, said two new sets of laboratory tests &#39;&#39;cast doubt on the extent to which the waste package will be an effective barrier under the repository conditions that have been presented to the board.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>One board member, Thure E. Cerling, a professor of biology and of geology and geophysics at the University of Utah, said that the problem was that &#39;&#39;most reactions take place faster at higher temperatures,&#39;&#39; and that this included rust.</p> <p>Any available water would be mixed with salt, present in the tunnels&#39; dust, the experts said. And just as salt prevents water from freezing, it also makes it harder to boil. The salty water could lead to pitting and perforation, the experts said.</p> <p>Another board member, David J. Duquette, head of the department of materials science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, remarked, &#39;&#39;We basically raised a flag and said, &#39;If you&#39;re going to do this, you&#39;ve decreased the possiblity of your container being a real barrier.&#39;&#39;</p>
1836132>F.A.A. Calls for a Runway Mapping System The Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday that it had asked the industry to design a device for the cockpit of a plane that shows the plane&#39;s position on an airport map to help pilots avoid becoming confused and using the wrong runway or taxiway. The agency acted in advance of a National Transportation Safety Board symposium on runway safety on Tuesday. An electronic map display like those commonly found in cars, relying on the global positioning satellite system, would be &#39;&#39;a breakthrough application,&#39;&#39; said Marion Blakey, the aviation agency administrator.  <p>Last August the crew of a jet trying to take off in Lexington, Ky., picked the wrong runway, which was too short. The jet crashed into a field, killing 49 of the 50 people on board.</p> <p>Ms. Blakey would not speculate about whether that crash could have been avoided by a moving map device, but said that it could help drive down the number of cases of &#39;&#39;runway incursion,&#39;&#39; in which a plane is in potential conflict with another plane, truck, car or other vehicle.</p> <p>In poor weather, pilots can use cockpit instruments to find the runway and land safely, but those instruments cannot help them navigate over the taxiways to the terminal.</p> <p>Pilots have been involved in harrowing close calls when they have mistaken one runway for another, one taxiway for another, or a taxiway for a runway. For years, aviation experts have said that a global positioning map system is an obvious solution.The safety board has called for development of a system that would warn pilots in their cockpits of impending collisions on the ground. But the aviation agency says that is beyond reach for now because it would require knowing the intentions of planes at the airport. So it is seeking development of a device intended only to show each crew its own position, and not the position of other planes.</p>
301916>Bush Pressed to Drop Pick for Weapons Post Five senators have called on President Bush to withdraw his nomination of an official who regulates civilian atomic power plants to head the nation&#39;s nuclear weapons program.  <p>The five said in a letter sent Thursday that &#39;&#39;we have deep reservations&#39;&#39; regarding the &#39;&#39;qualifications and fitness&#39;&#39; of the official, Victor Stello Jr. The letter cited what the senators, all Democrats, called &#39;&#39;his record of circumventing health and safety regulations and obstructing investigations while at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Senate Armed Services Committee is scheduled to take up the nomination on Wednesday.</p> <p>Mr. Stello, the chief of staff at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, has been on loan to the Department of Energy&#39;s bomb program since July, when his nomination was announced. Because of the delay in confirming him in the job, the Energy Secretary, James D. Watkins, last month announced that the position for which Mr. Stello has been nominated, Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs, would be given on an acting basis to the department&#39;s top-ranking official, John Tuck.</p> <p>Mr. Tuck said in a telephone interview yesterday that the Secretary&#39;s move was intended to dramatize the need for Senate action on the nomination.</p> <p>The five Democratic senators are Richard H. Bryan of Nevada, where the department is seeking to situate a permanent repository for high-level radioactive waste; Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio, where the department has been sued by the state and citizen groups for pollution from bomb factories; Brock Adams of Washington, where the department&#39;s heavily polluted Hanford reservation is situated; Tim Wirth of Colorado, where the Rocky Flats plant is under investigation for surreptitious dumping of toxic wastes, and Alan Cranston of California, where two bomb laboratories are situated.</p> <p>The five wrote that &#39;&#39;as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#39;s executive director, Mr. Stello has contributed to criticism that the N.R.C. is unable or unwilling to assure the high level of nuclear safety contemplated by the Atomic Energy Act.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Tuck yesterday restated Secretary Watkins&#39;s support for Mr. Stello.</p>
1843526>U.S. Employees Selling Transit Passes Illegally, Investigators Say To save gas, cut air pollution and unclog roads, the federal government gives its workers about $250 million a year in bus and subway passes. But many of the employees drive to work anyway and sell the transit passes on the Internet for cash, according to Congressional investigators. &#39;&#39;The metro cards are brand new, never used and do not expire,&#39;&#39; read one online description for subway passes in Washington, where many of the sales originate. &#39;&#39;I am selling these because I receive them monthly as part of my benefits at work, and I now have too many.&#39;&#39;  <p>Government employees who resell the passes are committing fraud, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office, scheduled to be released Tuesday by Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota.</p> <p>But little has been done to stop the sales, investigators said, adding that they did not know of any prosecutions.</p> <p>In one case, a man working at the Defense Department began receiving cards in March 2003; his wife, who also worked there, joined the program in September 2005. But they drove to work, according to the auditors, and the husband made 61 separate sales of the cards on eBay, netting about $6,000.</p> <p>The cards commonly sell for about 80 percent of face value. The delivery charge is sometimes listed as the price of a first-class stamp.</p> <p>The report made evident that there were problems other than sales that the government had not done anything about.</p> <p>For example, according to the auditors, one woman signed up for the benefit when she worked at the Commerce Department. After she left there in 2001, the fare cards kept coming. The government did not notice the error until 2006, and then only because the woman changed home addresses.</p> <p>Over all, she improperly received about $4,000 worth of fare cards, the auditors said. The investigators did not make clear whether she sold or used them.</p> <p>Investigators also found that some federal employees who received the maximum subsidy -- $110 a month this year -- appeared to live in places where the price of commuting was less than that.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Loose internal controls and a complete lack of government oversight have led to waste and fraud in an estimated 25 percent of these distributions,&#39;&#39; Mr. Coleman said in a statement.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;This is more than just pocket change in a $250 million per year subsidy program.&#39;&#39;</p>
334945>Whistle-Blowers in Atomic Plants Would Be Protected by New Plan The Department of Energy says it will propose procedures to protect nuclear weapons workers who complain about health or safety violations from retaliation by their employers.  <p>The new procedures, the department said Wednesday, will extend the protections of the Federal Whistle-Blower Protection Act of 1989 to about 100,000 employees of Energy Department contractors.</p> <p>James D. Watkins, the Secretary of Energy, said, &#39;&#39;We must protect these people so that they will feel free to come forward with their good-faith concerns.&#39;&#39; The department is in the early stages of a vast cleanup, having acknowledged in recent years that the nation&#39;s nuclear weapons plants were operated for decades with little concern for the environment or for workers&#39; health and safety.</p> <p>Complaints of Harassment</p> <p>Despite protections in the Atomic Energy Act and other laws, employees of four contractors at four different sites have said that after they raised safety concerns, their superiors ordered them to see psychiatrists or psychologists. Others have said they were harassed, demoted or laid off.</p> <p>Thomas Carpenter, a lawyer who represents some who complained, said in an interview that the proposed rule was &#39;&#39;the first step toward due process.&#39;&#39; But he added that the new procedures would still provide a weaker standard than those at other agencies, like the Department of Defense and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Department of Energy disputed that.</p> <p>Mr. Carpenter&#39;s group, the Government Accountability Project in Washington, had petitioned the department to develop a rule. But the department said it had acted independently.</p> <p>Under the proposed procedure, to be published this week in The Federal Register, employees who felt they were victims of retaliation could complain to the Energy Department field manager. If the manager could not resolve the complaint, the department would appoint a hearing officer. The proposal does not make clear who the hearing officer would be, but department officials said he would be independent of the contractor and department managers.</p> <p>Procedure Is Faulted</p> <p>But Mr. Carpenter noted that other agencies draw hearing officers and administrative law judges from the Department of Labor. He said this made it more likely that they would be impartial than would be the case under the Energy Department procedures, which say an outside investigator or judge can be used only at the option of the department, not the employee.</p> <p>In most cases, the hearing officer would make a recommendation to the head of the regional office of the Department of Energy, who would make a ruling. If that ruling upheld the employee&#39;s complaint, the manager could order the contractor to give back pay, restore benefits and cover lawyers&#39; fees. Either party could appeal to the Secretary of Energy.</p> <p>Mr. Carpenter complained that the regional managers who would make the decisions are graded by headquarters on how well they meet production schedules and budgets. &#39;&#39;A whistle-blower is often bringing up safety problems that can cost money,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>But M. J. Jameson, a spokeswoman for the department, said, &#39;&#39;The priorities around here are completely changing.&#39;&#39; The goals for the managers now, she said, &#39;&#39;very heavily emphasize the protection of the environment and those who step forward to make statements in furtherance of that aim.&#39;&#39;</p>
83494>Seabrook Utility Has New Woes The Public Service Company of New Hampshire moved a step closer to bankruptcy yesterday when its board voted to skip a $37.5 million interest payment due tomorrow.  <p>The missed payment will automatically begin a 30-day grace period after which the company could be declared insolvent. A bankruptcy, if it occurred, would be the first of an investor-owned electric utility since the Great Depression, according to industry experts.</p> <p>Public Service of New Hampshire has been driven to the brink of insolvency because of its $2.1 billion investment in the Seabrook nuclear power plant, which may be blocked from opening because of safety fears raised by its neighbors. The company&#39;s 35.6 percent share of the nuclear plant represents two-thirds of its current assets. Rate Request Still Pending</p> <p>Seeking relief, Public Service earlier this year sought a 15 percent emergency rate increase, which would yield about $70 million a year. But that request has become mired in a procedural tangle.</p> <p>The company said yesterday that it would not make the interest payment on 17.5 percent debentures due 2004. It said it would also omit principal and interest payments on its floating rate unsecured promissary notes due May 1, 1988; 15.75 percent debentures due 1988; 14 3/8 percent debentures due 1991, and 15 percent debentures due 2003, effective immediately.</p> <p>The company has not paid dividends on its common and preferred stock for more than three years.</p> <p>In late July, Public Service proposed a capital restructuring plan under which holders of third mortgage bonds and unsecured debt, including all the instruments on which payments have been suspended, would exchange them for new debt and equity securites. Creditors Propose Alternate Plan</p> <p>Consolidated Utilities and Communications Inc., a creditors&#39; group that says it represents a majority of the outstanding third mortgage bonds, has proposed an alternate plan. But no agreement appears imminent.</p> <p>The company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 22 that, without a change in its circumstances, it could no longer borrow money on Wall Street.</p> <p>The decision to skip the payment due tomorrow had been recommended by management &#39;&#39;to reduce the possibility that the company will exhaust its cash during the pendency of the exchange offer,&#39;&#39; a spokesman, John Cavanagh, said yesterday.</p> <p>The company maintains that before it can get the rate increase, the New Hampshire Supreme Court would have to invalidate a 1979 law forbidding utilities to collect money from customers for investments in plants not yet in service. Public Utility Commission Role</p> <p>The State Supreme Court, after hearing this argument, sent the case to the Public Utility Commission to determine whether the rate increase could be granted without counting the Seabrook investment and how the timing of that investment fit with the passage of the law.</p> <p>The Public Utility Commission may answer those questions this week, but it is not clear whether the court would have time to rule before Nov. 15.</p> <p>A consumer group is arguing that Public Service cannot challenge the law now, because it failed to do so when the commission first ruled on the matter in 1979. The State Attorney General, who is defending the constitutionality of the statute, filed a motion last Thursday asking the court not to dismiss that argument without a full hearing.</p> <p>Another possibility is that investors might be induced to put more money into the company if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted to give the nuclear plant a low-power license or made it easier for the plant to get an operating license. The plant in Seabrook, a coastal town near the Massachusetts border, has been fervidly opposed by its neighbors, who have raised questions about its emergency evacuation plans. Avoiding Involuntary Bankruptcy</p> <p>The utility might still avoid an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding in November without new capital, according to James Heffernan, a bankruptcy lawyer and partner in Consolidated Utilities and Communications.</p> <p>Although any three creditors owed an aggregate of $5,000 could ask a judge to declare the company insolvent, he said, the court might give the company more time to pursue an out-of-court restructuring agreement.</p> <p>However, Mr. Heffernan said, failure to make principal and interest payments might start defaults that would make it impossible for Public Service to issue the new securities that would be required for restructuring.</p>
735677>Privatizing Airports: Cities&#39; Successes and Giuliani&#39;s Plan What goes on at airports is about the same everywhere: planes land and take off, dropping off passengers or cargo and taking on more; travelers park, eat, shop, use telephones, meeting rooms and bathrooms. But some airports provide good service at low cost, and some don&#39;t, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani thinks that Kennedy and La Guardia are in the second group. To move them into the first -- and increase city revenues from the airports, which he says are &quot;scandalously low&quot; -- he would like to sell the airports to a private company or at least hire a private company to run them.  <p>The proposal by Mr. Giuliani is one of several ways in which he has suggested that the private sector might take over government services, and it is an idea that has been tested at airports elsewhere. Private management is now in use to varying degrees in Toronto, Albany, Pittsburgh and Burbank, Calif. And in London, the agency that runs the airports has been made a private company.</p> <p>&quot;You bring in an outfit or an organization that has expertise in the running of an airport, and there is a greater incentive on the part of the private entity to do a good job,&quot; said Michael J. Hoblock, the Albany County Executive. Albany stopped short of selling its airport because of objections from the Federal Government, but turned the management over in 1990 to Lockheed Air Terminal Inc. (A different subsidiary of Lockheed was barred from contracting with New York City during the Dinkins administration in the Parking Violations Bureau scandal, but Lockheed Air Terminal says it is not affected by that ban.)</p> <p>The president of Lockheed Air Terminal, Viggo Butler, gave another reason. Shopping centers and other businesses compete with one another, and airports are no different, he said. &quot;They have to attract people because people have lots of choices,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Lockheed entered discussions 18 months ago on managing Kennedy and La Guardia, and is still interested, along with a handful of other companies that specialize in the field. In some places these companies run whole airports, from managing capital projects to bringing in new airlines and renting retail space; in others they manage only a terminal or two, or some aspect of operations, like fueling.</p> <p>Pittsburgh International, for example, has a new terminal, with the normal array of jetways and waiting areas at the periphery, and in the center has a sparkling Airmall, with dozens of stores and restaurants of the kind found in upscale malls around the country, including the Body Shop, the Nature Company, Ethel M Chocolates, W. H. Smith, Waterstone&#39;s Booksellers, Johnston &amp; Murphy, T.G.I. Friday&#39;s and Au Bon Pain. Prices are guaranteed to be no higher than at the chains&#39; off-airport operations.</p> <p>The mall is managed by BAA USA Inc., a company that used to be the British Airports Authority until it was privatized by the British Government under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980&#39;s. It still runs the London airports and now sells its services abroad.</p> <p>The airport in Burbank was privately built in the 1920&#39;s and has been privately run ever since, although it is now state-owned. The head of the public works aviation division of Los Angeles County, Ted A. Gustin, said the operator and former owner, Lockheed, ran the airport well and had successfully brought in new carriers as old ones had cut back. It also brought in innovations like valet parking.</p> <p>In Albany, Lockheed replaced an airport manager who Mr. Hoblock said was performing poorly. If the manager&#39;s job had been a Civil Service position, Mr. Hoblock said, the replacement would have been very difficult.</p> <p>When the Canadian Federal Government needed a new terminal at Lester B. Pearson Airport in Toronto, it turned to private companies because they had the investment capital. Lockheed spent $550 million (Canadian) to build Terminal 3, now home to United Airlines, American Airlines and other carriers. The building is an architectural showcase, according to the airport public affairs manager, Bruce Reid, who said that &quot;everything seems to be running very well.&quot;</p> <p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages Kennedy International and La Guardia, along with Newark International Airport, says it agrees with most of the logic of privatization. But in the authority&#39;s view, both Kennedy and La Guardia are already mostly private.</p> <p>For example, Stanley Brezenoff, the executive director of the Port Authority, says that his &quot;quasi-public&quot; agency can pay competitive wages for managers, above government caps.</p> <p>And of the 60,000 people employed at the two airports, he said, only 1,200 work for the Port Authority, including 300 police officers, who would presumably continue no matter who owned and ran the airports. Of the remaining employees, only about 1,500 work for the Port Authority&#39;s own contractors, he said; the rest work for airlines or other companies that the authority does not control.</p> <p>The authority also believes it has more to offer City Hall than another operator would because of an unusual provision of Federal law. Generally the Federal Government bars local governments from using airports as a way to finance municipal budgets because Washington&#39;s goal is to maintain a national transportation system, not balance city budgets. But the Port Authority has an exemption that allows it to use airport revenues to pay rent to the city. Bringing in a private operator might require changes in the Federal law before New York City could benefit.</p> <p>But City Hall believes that others could do the job better. &quot;The Port Authority is a bit too chunky around the middle and resembles the Board of Education,&quot; said Forrest R. Taylor, a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani. Among the authority&#39;s notable stumbles at Kennedy in the last few years was a $21 million baggage tunnel that was never used, a $22 million freight mover that was stopped after six weeks and a $56 million parking garage that is mostly unused.</p> <p>Meanwhile, supporters of privatization are gaining influence in Albany. One is Gov. George E. Pataki, who will join Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey in choosing a successor to Mr. Brezenoff when he steps down next month; Mr. Pataki will also be replacing half of the Port Authority&#39;s board.</p> <p>In addition, the new State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, is a strong backer of privatization and has argued in the past that the sale of the airports would generate revenue that could allow Albany to reduce aid to New York City.</p> <p>How far New York could go is an open question. It might follow the model of Pittsburgh, which brought in BAA; the city of Philadelphia announced on Dec. 14 that it would bring in a private management team to run retailing at its airport.</p> <p>What BAA does, said Michael E. Bell, the head of the Pittsburgh operation, is manage, not operate.</p> <p>&quot;We don&#39;t make a sandwich or pour coffee, any more than we fuel a single plane,&quot; he said. &quot;We make sure there is competition and choice.&quot;</p> <p>BAA also enforces a rule, he said, that its subtenants cannot price anything above what they charge in off-airport operations.</p> <p>According to the Port Authority, it is already moving in a similar direction. On Feb. 10, the authority said it had signed an agreement with one of the companies involved in Philadelphia, MarketPlace Development Inc. of Boston, to manage retailing at La Guardia&#39;s central terminal.</p> <p>&quot;People&#39;s expectations of retailing are pretty high because of shopping malls,&quot; said Susan M. Baer, the general manager at La Guardia, who said that the company had submitted its plans on Dec. 30 and that the first phase of an overhaul would begin this summer.</p> <p>While the Port Authority tries bringing in private management for its retail space, BAA would like to go much farther and run a whole airport in this country. At Heathrow and Gatwick, London&#39;s two big international airports, which are entirely operated by BAA, Mr. Bell cited one study that showed that charges to airlines run less than half what they do at Kennedy and Newark.</p> <p>A less drastic approach than the one taken by the Thatcher government but one that goes further than the Pittsburgh operation is letting a corporation own the buildings, as Toronto did.</p> <p>&quot;There&#39;s a feeling, I guess with some validity, that airports are a thriving business activity and it&#39;s difficult to run a business activity in a government framework,&quot; said John H. Spinks, director of marketing at Transport Canada, which is the Canadian equivalent of the Department of Transportation.</p> <p>Another option is the process now under way in Indianapolis, where the mayor, Stephen Goldsmith, has taken municipal services ranging from filling potholes to running the sewage treatment plant, and put them out to bid, with municipal employees as one of the bidders.</p> <p>Competition may seem to play little role in air travel since passengers who live in the New York region or must travel to the area have no choice. But transportation experts say a passenger traveling between, say, London and Los Angeles can decide whether to stop at Dulles, O&#39;Hare or Kennedy, and, all other things being equal, may avoid Kennedy.</p> <p>&quot;The airports were bought and paid for by airlines and their customers,&quot; said Timothy Neale, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, an airline industry group, who pointed out that construction was financed with fees from the airlines and passengers, not general tax revenues. &quot;We don&#39;t want to be in a position of paying for those facilities a second time.&quot;</p> <p>But noting the importance of the details of the deal, he added, &quot;The bottom line is if it makes for a more efficient operation and lowers costs, they&#39;re going to favor it.&quot;</p> <p>There is no deadline for a decision -- the current leases do not expire until 2015 -- but the uncertainty has already introduced complications. The Port Authority has switched to selling bonds that mature no later than 2015 and has started paying down some debt in anticipation of losing the lease.</p> <p>The authority has also begun to argue that it needs the revenues from the airports to support other operations, like the PATH commuter trains, which get a subsidy of $200 million a year, and the authority&#39;s midtown bus terminal, which costs $60 million a year more than revenues earned there.</p>
1295350>New Technologies Are Highlighted Coal, the fuel already used to generate most of this country&#39;s electricity, could create more kilowatt-hours per ton and less of the pollutants that cause smog and acid rain, according to the Bush administration&#39;s energy plan, which proposes spending $2 billion in federal money on research and demonstration projects. The country has hundreds of years of coal available, probably at stable prices. &#39;&#39;New clean-coal technologies are showing that air pollution can be reduced and energy efficiency increased, by using America&#39;s abundant supply of coal,&#39;&#39; according to the report. But even when cleaned of conventional pollutants, environmentalists point out, coal produces far more carbon dioxide, which is thought to cause global climate change, than natural gas or oil.  <p>The federal government has spent about $1.8 billion on clean-coal technologies in the last 15 years, combined with $3.6 billion from states and private companies, but some money available for subsidies has gone unspent.</p> <p>The report highlights a technology developed by Powerspan, a company in New Durham, N.H. In a test using a tiny part of the exhaust from a First Energy plant in Shadyside, Ohio, the Powerspan technology cut nitrogen oxides, which cause smog, by 76 percent, and sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, by 44 percent, while reducing mercury and other toxic metals. First Energy hopes to soon replicate the test on a larger scale at a plant near Cleveland.</p> <p>David G. Hawkins, at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: &#39;&#39;The president&#39;s plan proposes to squander $2 billion by making it available to virtually any coal project that wants to put the label &#39;clean&#39; on its proposal. It would be much better to take a small fraction of the $2 billion and concentrate it on the most promising technology.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>MATTHEW L. WALD</p> <p>THE ENERGY PLAN: COAL</p>
119876>ANTISMOKING CRUSADER: Richard A. Daynard; Using Liability Law To Put Tobacco On Trial WHEN rumors hit Wall Street in late November that Richard A. Daynard, professor of law at Northeastern University, was about to disclose something embarrassing to the cigarette industry, it was enough to send the stocks of tobacco companies down 4 percent.  <p>The &#39;&#39;something,&#39;&#39; disclosed at a news conference called by Professor Daynard on Dec. 1, was a memorandum stating that a lawyer for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company had privately acknowledged the link between smoking and cancer.</p> <p>The memo was immediately disputed by the industry, and afterward, Professor Daynard appeared to be disappointed that it was not more widely accepted. But by the end of the day, tobacco stocks regained only 26 percent of what they had lost.</p> <p>Wall Street&#39;s skittishness shows how much investors think the industry is vulnerable to product-liability cases of the kind supported by the work of Professor Daynard and the legal-resource group he heads, the Tobacco Products Liability Project. &#39;&#39;When you talk to investors, I don&#39;t think you&#39;d have many say they thought any of the tobacco companies would be another Manville,&#39;&#39; said Henry D&#39;Auria, an analyst at Paine Webber, referring to the asbestos company that entered bankruptcy after courts found its products caused lung disease. &#39;&#39;But they are definitely pricing tobacco companies as though that fear were certain.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>So far, the fear has not been realized. Since 1954, 321 liability cases have been filed against tobacco companies; 207 have been dismissed or withdrawn, and none have been lost by the industry. Not a penny has been won in judgment.</p> <p>But Professor Daynard is out to change that. &#39;&#39;The industry is invulnerable as long as everybody says the industry is invulnerable,&#39;&#39; he said. Since he co-founded his tobacco-liability group, he has been helping attorneys who take the cases of smokers - or, more often, their estates.</p> <p>His nonprofit project, financed largely by a $30,000 annual grant from the Rockefeller Family Fund, is a clearinghouse of information and ideas. Its official publication, the Tobacco Products Liability Reporter, is a thick compendium of recent opinions, briefs, legal theories, legislation and other documents related to tobacco. About 100 subscribers pay $750 for 10 issues a year.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;A lot of the successes of the lawyers, a lot of their efficiencies, would not be there but for Dick&#39;s efforts,&#39;&#39; said Marc Z. Edell, who represents the estate of Rose D. Cipollone in a widely watched liability case in Federal District Court in Newark against Philip Morris, the Liggett Group and the P. Lorillard division of the Loews Corporation.</p> <p>Professor Daynard says his efforts on behalf of smokers do not include weaning them from tobacco. &#39;&#39;I&#39;m not interested in cold turkeying 47 million adults,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Nor is he out to bankrupt the tobacco companies, he says. What he wants is for smokers or their families to win liability verdicts or settlements that will raise the price of cigarettes. &#39;&#39;My purpose is to keep kids from getting hooked on tobacco,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The basic premise of his campaign: Cigarettes cause cancer, and the tobacco industry knows it. When smokers suffer from tobacco-related illnesses, it is the fault of the industry, not of the smokers.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, Professor Daynard&#39;s premise does not go over well in the tobacco industry, which has never publicly accepted as conclusive the studies showing that smoking contributes to lung cancer, heart disease and other ailments.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;He&#39;s not terribly inventive; he&#39;s a Johnny one-note, the same old thing, time after time,&#39;&#39; said Walker Merryman, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute in Washington. He added, though, that Professor Daynard was &#39;&#39;not as offensive&#39;&#39; as some in the anti-smoking campaign. &#39;&#39;Some others have called me &#39;the fifth horseman of the apocalypse;&#39; he has not.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Less offensive he may be. But the 44-year-old bearded lawyer could not be a more tenacious adversary. A few weeks ago, after a deadlocked jury caused a mistrial in a $17 million Mississippi lawsuit against the American Tobacco Company, a unit of American Brands, tobacco stocks rose briefly. But Professor Daynard said the outcome of the case - brought by the family of Nathan Horton, a smoker who died of lung cancer - was &#39;&#39;like flipping a coin and having it land on the edge. It&#39;s the closest we&#39;ve come yet.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Others in the legal community seem to agree. But in the past, say some supporters and almost every critic, Professor Daynard has been overconfident. &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know of a single prediction he made that has come true,&#39;&#39; said James A. Fyock, a spokesman for RJR Nabisco Inc., the parent of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco.</p> <p>Indeed, in December 1986 Professor Daynard told the National Law Journal that he &#39;&#39;would be amazed and upset&#39;&#39; if the movement did not win its first liability verdict against the multibillion-dollar tobacco industry by the end of 1987.</p> <p>But while some in the anti-smoking movement worry he may have damaged the cause by raising expectations too high, others say such passion will pay off.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;When you try to establish a new doctrine or principle, usually you will lose initially,&#39;&#39; said John F. Banzhaf 3d, a law professor at George Washington University and the head of Action on Smoking and Health, who brought the suit that forced cigarette advertising off television.</p> <p>A GRADUATE of the Bronx High School of Science and Columbia University, where he was a philosophy major, Professor Daynard says he first became concerned about tobacco while in college. &#39;&#39;I always felt something was wrong with the assumption that smoking was normal and that if you have an adverse reaction, you should be quiet.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A philosophy professor told him that if he wanted to change society, he should go to law school (he was &#39;&#39;too much of a klutz&#39;&#39; for medicine, Professor Daynard said).</p> <p>He went, graduating from Harvard Law School and also picking up a master&#39;s degree in sociology and a Ph. D. in urban planning from M. I. T. In 1969, he began teaching law at Northeastern, specializing in consumer protection - and again began to focus on the tobacco issue.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It always struck me as troubling that the most damaging consumer product was the least regulated,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;If you think rationally about what kind of change is conceivable and beneficial to society, short of reducing the risk of nuclear war, this comes next. It&#39;s much more important than all the other things consumer activists worry about.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Professor Daynard says his school-aged son has become so imbued with the idea that smoking is not healthy that the boy has been known to approach motorcyclists on the street and suggest that they crush out their smokes. &#39;&#39;Luckily, it&#39;s not macho to shoot 7-year-olds,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>While he taught at Northeastern, Professor Daynard became active in the local anti-smoking movement. He wrote the ordinance now in force in Newton, Mass. that bars smoking in some public places, and in 1983 joined the board of the Massachusetts chapter of GASP, the Group Against Smoking Pollution.</p> <p>Meanwhile, he recalled, plaintiffs began winning verdicts from asbestos manufacturers for diseases that were caused by the action of asbestos and tobacco together, and the principles began to emerge for legal action against tobacco companies.</p> <p>TO those legal precedents, Professor Daynard applied a philosophy drawn from the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s: through the courts, plaintiffs and their lawyers can bring about justice on a sweeping scale. The attraction of the law, he said, is that &#39;&#39;it&#39;s a place where genuine heroism can occur.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>He helped start the Tobacco Products Liability Project with a convention of attorneys and law professors who thought the industry was not invulnerable. The group now operates from a cluttered fifth-floor room on campus with cinder-block walls and a good view of the Northeastern gym. The staff consists of six people, including Professor Daynard himself.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Daynard gives you incredible leverage,&#39;&#39; said Donald K. Ross, director of the Rockefeller Family Fund, which provides about three-quarters of the group&#39;s financing. &#39;&#39;The guy is a non-stop worker. He does high-quality work and he squeezes every penny out of the dollars.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The project&#39;s Tobacco Products Liability Reporter carries documents that can be cited directly by a plaintiff&#39;s attorney - for example, a recent ruling in the Cipollone case that denied a defendant&#39;s attempt to bar testimony that Mrs. Cipollone was addicted to cigarettes.</p> <p>Professor Daynard has tried to disseminate the argument that smokers can be addicts, to counter the position of the tobacco companies that smoking is a matter of choice.</p> <p>Mr. Edell, the plaintiff&#39;s lawyer in the Cipollone case, also credits Professor Daynard for disseminating the concept that cigarettes are not just tobacco (which jurors might see as inherently dangerous and thus not the fault of cigarette makers) but a manufactured product. &#39;&#39;That is something he&#39;s gotten other people to focus attention on,&#39;&#39; Mr. Edell said.</p> <p>What&#39;s more, Mr. Edell says, Professor Daynard has spread the word about a tactic used in the Cipollone case: demanding, during the discovery phase of the trial, all research documents, marketing promotion documents and trade association documents in the files of the cigarette company, to find out what it knew about the risks of tobacco.</p> <p>PROFESSOR Daynard&#39;s controversial Dec. 1 news conference was part of the same effort to provide evidence for suits around the country. It was meant to show that the tobacco companies know that cigarettes and cancer are linked.</p> <p>In terms of the legal debate over smoking, the companies cannot be found guilty of knowingly selling a dangerous product if they do not accept the consensus view that smoking causes cancer.</p> <p>The memo disclosed by Professor Daynard was written by a Government doctor who said a tobacco-company lawyer admitted in a meeting with the Surgeon General that cancer is linked to cigarettes. The memo&#39;s author and one other participant in the meeting have stuck to the story; others - including the Surgeon General - have refused to comment.</p> <p>Still, Professor Daynard says the memo&#39;s release may eventually put before a jury the question of whether the companies sincerely believe that cigarettes do not cause cancer.</p> <p>John Madigan, director of governmental affairs for the American Cancer Society, agrees. &#39;&#39;In some court, sometime soon,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;some jury is going to realize what people have realized since 1964, when the Surgeon General first came out with his report - that there is a direct relationship between the use of tobacco and death, and that the tobacco companies are aware of what&#39;s going on.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Professor Daynard, Mr. Madigan said, is important in moving cases toward the point where juries decide that since tobacco companies have chosen to be in the marketplace, &#39;&#39;this is the cost of playing.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>That cost is what most interests Professor Daynard. If the price of cigarettes (now $1.10 a pack on average, according to the Tobacco Institute) were to rise toward the cost that smoking imposes on society, there would be many fewer smokers, he says. He quotes a Government study that says each pack sold adds $2.17 to the nation&#39;s costs in health care, lost wages and other areas.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Even if you were only 10 percent successful, if you added 25 cents,&#39;&#39; he said, &#39;&#39;you&#39;d probably get a savings of hundreds of thousands of lives.&#39;&#39;</p>
373523>Bursts of Solar Energy Endanger Power Lines Bursts of charged particles from the Sun sporadically cause huge surges of electric current through power lines on Earth, destroying transformers or tripping protective devices to take power lines and other equipment out of service and raising the possibility of widespread blackouts, utility experts say.  <p>Solar magnetic disturbances have long been recognized as a hazard to communications on earth and to satellites in earth orbit and, more recently, as a health risk for frequent airline passengers and flight crews. The disturbances, which also cause expanded displays of the northern lights, are increasingly being recognized as a threat to electric utilities.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;That&#39;s the sort of thing that can lead to a systemwide collapse, or a blackout,&#39;&#39; said John Kappenman of the Minnesota Power and Light Company, an engineer who has extensively analyzed a solar storm that occurred March 13, 1989, and caused wide damage, including $8 million worth to transformers at a New Jersey plant. &#39;&#39;It looks like we came extremely close to experiencing that sort of problem, from Pennsylvania up through the East Coast,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It would have been larger in scale than the great blackout of 1965.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Kappenman is a leader of a utility campaign to send a $30 million spacecraft aloft to stand sentry duty a million miles from Earth and provide about an hour&#39;s warning of solar storms.</p> <p>The next peak of activity in the Sun&#39;s 11-year cycle is expected between 1992 and 1994.</p> <p>North American Peril</p> <p>When the charged particles from such storms reach Earth, they can move the magnetic field that surrounds the planet, and if a magnetic field moves in relation to a conductor, it produces an electric current in the conductor. In this case, the conductor is the surface of the Earth itself, and the electric current that develops in it interferes with the man-made electric systems.</p> <p>Generally the electric charges in the Earth&#39;s surface equalize themselves by flowing back and forth through the soil or rock. But in places where the Earth is relatively impepvious to electricity, as in regions of the dense igneous rock formed by cooling of the planet&#39;s molten core, the current seeks an easier route. Power lines, which are deliberately attached to the ground as part of the way electric systems operate, provide a perfect alternative.</p> <p>Such currents are incompatible with the equipment that handles manufactured electricity and can disrupt or destroy it. The March 1989 solar storm, imperceptible to people, caused a blackout all over Quebec and ruined two of the three huge transformers at the Salem 1 nuclear station in southern New Jersey. The transformers cost $8 million to replace.</p> <p>Could Have Been Worse</p> <p>The Salem failures were among 200 that the North American Electric Reliability Council, a utility group, determined resulted from that storm. The damage extended as far as southern California. Eugene F. Gorzelnik, a spokesman for the council, said the failures would have had more serious consequences if the storm had occurred at a period of peak electrical demand, either in winter or summer, when there is far less safety margin in the transmission system.</p> <p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also registered its concern last month, warning reactor operators that a power surge could isolate them from electric supplies for instruments and controls and would require them to start their emergency generators.</p> <p>Representatives of several utilities and other experts discussed the problem this month at a conference of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. The engineers already voted at an April session to endorse a proposal by the reliability council for a spacecraft to watch for incoming particles.</p> <p>The satellite, called Windsock, would fly to a point where the gravitational fields of the Earth, the Sun and the Moon cancel each other out.</p> <p>The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration has already orbited satellites that measure solar activity, but their usefulness is limited because they are usually inside Earth&#39;s magnetic field, said Gary Heckman, chief of the Space Environment Services Division at the administration. The Windsock craft &#39;&#39;would be a tremendous help,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Heckman, who said that simply watching the Sun from a distance did not give enough information to predict storms on Earth.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Some small blob of mass leaves the Sun, and travels out through space, and we don&#39;t know quite what direction, how big it is, or how fast it&#39;s traveling,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We don&#39;t know the density, so we don&#39;t know how much energy it has in it. And we don&#39;t know the orientation of the field.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Windsock would take such readings from a location directly &#39;&#39;upwind,&#39;&#39; so to speak, of the Earth. The advance warning would be possible because the subatomic particles and other components of the &#39;&#39;solar wind&#39;&#39; travel much slower than light and other electromagnetic radiation from the Sun, so the satellite&#39;s radioed alarm would outrace the solar burst by about an hour.</p> <p>Time Is Short for Launching</p> <p>Utility engineers differ on how useful the warning would be, but most say it would be at least some help because they could reduce the power loads on certain transformers and lines that have proved vulnerable in the past. In addition, much of the equipment that is set to trip out of service at certain levels of abnormality in the current could be temporarily made less sensitive.</p> <p>But Mr. Heckman and officials of the reliability council say it is not clear where the money would come from. Moreover, time is short to launch a satellite.</p> <p>The potential beneficiaries of a satellite&#39;s warning would also include airlines and their passengers. The Federal Aviation Administration is planning a meeting in September of about 200 experts on the subject.</p> <p>The airlines now have more planes flying at high altitudes, above most of the protective blanket of the atmosphere, and over the North magnetic pole, where the Earth&#39;s magnetic field does not block incoming particles, than they did in earlier peak periods of solar activity.</p> <p>Some frequent travelers receive radiation doses that are higher, even when solar activity is normal, than do most nuclear plant workers. With warning, say experts, some planes could be rerouted or flown at lower altitudes, beneath more of the protective blanket of the atmosphere.</p>

714174>Transportation Workers Face More Frequent Tests for Drugs Thousands of bus drivers, train engineers and other transportation workers in the region will face more frequent random testing for drugs and alcohol beginning in January under a Federal law that is expected to cost regional transit operators millions of dollars a year. The New York Transit Authority expects its annual cost of testing to rise to $5 million from $1.5 million.  <p>It&#39;s going to be a complicated proposition,&quot; said Jared Lebow, a Transit Authority spokesman, &quot;with some overtime or regularly scheduled extra train operators or bus operators, to make sure we don&#39;t impact service too greatly.&quot;</p> <p>The law requires that transit systems conduct one random urine test for drugs each year for every two employees in &quot;safety sensitive&quot; jobs, and one breath test for alcohol for every four &quot;safety sensitive&quot; employees.</p> <p>The degree to which alcohol is a problem is not clear. In August 1991 a drunken subway operator killed five people in a crash in Union Square, which prompted New York to increase its testing. In contrast, Connecticut Transit, a bus system with 775 employees, conducted 1,172 random tests over three years from 1991 to 1993 and found no alcohol use. It did find more than a dozen with traces of marijuana or cocaine, though.</p> <p>Some bus drivers in Connecticut and New Jersey have never been subject to random alcohol tests.</p> <p>At the Federal Transit Authority, Judy Z. Meade, the senior drug and alcohol program manager, said that some systems that had never tested would find &quot;in the neighborhood of 5 to 6 percent positive tests.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Rates will be fairly high for the first two years, because it takes time for corporate climate to change,&quot; Ms. Meade said. &quot;It takes time for John Doe to see his buddy Sam Smith be hauled away.&quot; But the deterrent will grow over time, she said.</p> <p>The Federal rules, issued by the Department of Transportation in February under the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing of 1991, requires testing in the middle of workers&#39; shifts, which means having substitute workers available. Most systems that test now do it at the beginning or end of the work day.</p> <p>Conducting even half as many tests as there are employees will not insure that everyone is tested. Michael A. Sanders, the Transit and Ridesharing Administrator at the Connecticut Department of Transportation, said that despite having conducted nearly 1,200 random tests in three years on a work force of 775, about 200 people have never been tested.</p> <p>While the Connecticut tests found no alcohol, Mr. Lebow said that at the New York Transit Authority in 1993, 0.47 percent tested positive for alcohol on random tests, and 1.85 percent in drug tests. The drug rate was comparable to Connecticut Transit&#39;s.</p> <p>The Transit Authority and other systems also conduct tests as part of pre-employment physicals, when workers return to duty after extended absences, after accidents, and whenever the authority is suspicious.</p> <p>At the Port Authority, about 1,400 employees who drive snowplows, dump trucks and runway sweepers will be subject to testing for the first time, said John M. Kampfe, a spokesman. Another 450 workers on the PATH system, including engineers, train dispatchers and signalmen are already tested for drugs, but not alcohol.</p> <p>At New Jersey Transit, existing drug tests nearly meet the new Federal standards, said Elizabeth Schneider, director of medical services. But alcohol tests will be new and will probably turn up a substantial number of people working under the influence, especially in rail operations, she said. &quot;People work unsupervised,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s a traditional railroad problem.&quot;</p> <p>Under the new Federal regulations, breath test readings showing a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.02 to 0.039 constitute grounds for taking an employee out of service for up to eight hours. From 0.04 up, the employee must be removed from the job and referred to a substance abuse program for professional evaluation, she said.</p> <p>In most states a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.1 (or two and a half times as high as 0.04) is sufficient to convict the driver of a private automobile of driving while impaired or drunk.</p>
581822>Lawmakers Call Bomb Plant Prosecution Too Lenient Congressional investigators looking into the prosecution of the Rockwell International Corporation for environmental crimes at the Rocky Flats nuclear bomb plant charged yesterday that the Justice Department was far too easy on the company. The investigators said some department officials, inexperienced and overly conservative, probably gave up millions of dollars in fines and additional convictions against the corporation and some executives. The Justice Department was so reluctant to go to trial that it caved in to Rockwell&#39;s main goals in negotiations over a plea agreement, the Congressional investigators assert in a report. Most important, the company refused to plead guilty to any charge that implied that toxic or radioactive materials had escaped from the site, the report says. This would have left Rockwell vulnerable to civil suits by neighbors of the plant, which is in the northwest suburbs of Denver. Lobbying by Energy Dept. The report, by the Investigations and Oversight Sub  <p>The report, by the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, also said the Energy Department lobbied the Justice Department to go easy on the company, apparently to limit the possibility of civil suits.</p> <p>The chairman of the subcommittee, Representative Howard Wolpe, Democrat of Michigan, said in a telephone interview yesterday that because the charges were dropped, prosecutors &quot;lost the ability to disclose the totality of what happened there.&quot;</p> <p>He said his panel found that prosecutors had evidence that poisons were spread into drinking water, in violation of the Clean Water Act, but had no data on how much or how serious a problem was created. In fact, he said, the prosecutors stopped pursuing some leads when it became clear that more charges would jeopardize a negotiated settlement. A Denial From Justice</p> <p>The panel&#39;s assertions were denied yesterday by Neil Cartusciello, chief of the Environmental Crimes Section of the Justice Department, who said in a telephone interview, &quot;The notion that Washington was holding the reins or hamstringing the U.S. Attorney&#39;s office in Denver is just flatly untrue.&quot; He called the committee&#39;s argument &quot;reckless and irresponsible.&quot;</p> <p>Nevertheless, from interviewing Justice Department officials and studying internal documents, the committee found that even as prosecutors in Denver wanted to charge executives and pursue a broader investigation against the corporation, a deputy assistant attorney general in Washington was telling his superiors that Rockwell had &quot;some quite persuasive defenses to many of the corporate charges.&quot;</p> <p>Writing to Attorney General William Barr last March, nearly three years after scores of agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the plant to gather evidence, the deputy, Barry Hartman, said: &quot;Quite frankly, although we can meet the standards under the principles of Federal prosecution, had we known at the time of the warrant what we now know, it is likely this matter would have been resolved civilly.&quot; Mr. Hartman was the highest-ranking official criticized in the report, which names about a dozen Justice Department aides. &#39;Terrible Substances&#39;</p> <p>Federal prosecutors in Denver were aware as they bargained away some of the charges that they could be creating questions about the worth of their efforts, according to the report. For instance, the report cites a March 19, 1992, memorandum from Kenneth Fimberg, the lead lawyer in the case, which said that the department should anticipate &quot;a barrage of inquiries&quot; because &quot;terrible substances&quot; were getting into drinking water.</p> <p>Rockwell pleaded guilty last June to five felony and five misdemeanor violations of Federal environmental laws and paid a fine of $18.5 million. But the plea agreement, which followed a five-year investigation, raised bitter protests in Denver. The grand jury that heard the case was so outraged that a majority of its members reassembled recently and signed a letter asking President-elect Bill Clinton to investigate the Justice Department&#39;s handling of the prosecution.</p> <p>A Rockwell official said yesterday that the company would have no comment until it had seen the Congressional report.</p> <p>In defending himself against assertions that Rockwell was let off too easily, the United States Attorney in Denver, Michael Norton, has pointed out repeatedly that the $18.5 million fine was the first against a bomb plant contractor without the contractor&#39;s invoking a standard clause in its agreement with the Energy Department that makes the Government liable for such fines. The agreement for Rockwell to pay the fine was hailed as a landmark.</p> <p>However, the report notes, to date Rockwell has billed the Government for $7.9 million of its legal fees in the case, and it suggested a General Accounting Office study of whether that money should be paid.</p> <p>The report also asserts that Mr. Norton and especially Mr. Fimberg pushed for more charges but were held back by their superiors in Washington. Those superiors also blocked the release of a grand jury report on the plant, the report said.</p> <p>The report is a parting shot at the top echelon of the Justice Department, which will be replaced when Mr. Clinton takes office, by Mr. Wolpe, who is retiring and whose term expires today.</p> <p>The report also makes these points:</p> <p>*The Energy Department, which hired Rockwell and which owns Rocky Flats, lobbied the Justice Department during the plea negotiations to allow the company to plead &quot;nolo contendere&quot; instead of guilty. The lobbying, by Henson Moore, then Deputy Secretary of Energy, came despite the department&#39;s pledge of cooperation with the investigation and was apparently an effort to limit the possibility of civil suits against Rockwell or the department by the plant&#39;s neighbors.</p> <p>*Prosecutors in Denver could not pursue some charges because they were uncertain about the contents of some barrels of waste, and the only laboratories that could analyze the wastes were controlled by Rockwell itself or the Department of Energy.</p> <p>*The Justice Department, as part of a campaign to have Rockwell agree to a plea bargain, assured the company that if there were a grand jury report, it would not say anything that would open Rockwell to civil suits. When Congressional investigators asked about this, the Justice Department tried to keep the matter secret by saying it was covered by rules governing grand jury secrecy.</p> <p>The report concludes that prosecutors in Denver were repeatedly held back by their superiors in Washington, and that Justice Department headquarters blocked the preparation of a grand jury report that could have been released to the public.</p> <p>When the settlement was first proposed last March, the Justice Department said that one reason the prosecution was not more extensive was that the violation had been condoned by a Department of Energy &quot;culture,&quot; a rationale that Mr. Wolpe called &quot;the white collar equivalent of blaming an armed robbery on &#39;society,&#39; not the individual holding the gun.</p> <p>His report recommended that the committee take testimony from the officials in Washington who were involved in the decision to block the release of a grand jury report, and that Congress look for a way to allow grand jury members to be released from their oath of secrecy.</p>
426998>The Ground War and the American Economy; Further Drop Seen In the Price of Oil The ground war against Iraq is likely to result in lower oil prices, at least in the short term, experts said yesterday. Most of these experts said a short ground war was more likely to bring lower prices than a longer conflict. The new phase of the war reduced still further what the market had seen as a minuscule chance of Iraq&#39;s interfering with Saudi Arabia&#39;s oil production, the experts said.  <p>&quot;It was never going to happen, but everyone was worried about it,&quot; said Peter C. Beutel, an oil analyst at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. Mr. Beutel said that uncertainty had kept prices higher than they otherwise would have been. Adding to Exports</p> <p>Mr. Beutel added that pushing Iraq out of Kuwait would hasten the resumption of oil exports from Kuwait, and even from Iraq, adding to the oil supply on world markets.</p> <p>Daniel C. Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said that if the war continued to look &quot;fairly quick and pretty clear in its outcome,&quot; it would reinforce the underlying direction of the market, which is down.</p> <p>Mr. Yergin, the author of a recent history of the oil industry, &quot;The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power,&quot; said this oil crisis appeared likely to end like the five others since World War II. &quot;Each one began with a shortage or specter of shortage and ended with a surplus,&quot; he said. Short-Term Surplus</p> <p>Many experts say the market seems to expect a surplus that will depress prices for the short term. In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price for delivery of oil in the soonest-available month is low relative to prices for delivery in later months.</p> <p>But the short-term price could rise, Mr. Yergin said, if the war dragged on, if chemical weapons were used or if questions arose about the determination of the United States and its allies. As Mr. Yergin made his assessment, however, on the day after the ground war had begun, that scenario seemed unlikely.</p> <p>Oil for April delivery had closed down 59 cents, at $17.91 a barrel, on the Merc on Friday, its lowest price since July. In the after-hours cash market, it was trading 25 to 30 cents below that. And it was trading even lower in the limited cash market over the weekend, said Edward A. Silliere Jr., the managing news editor of Telerate, an electronic financial reporting service.</p> <p>He said that when the Merc re-opens today, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be at all surprised to see oil $1 down.&quot; One reason, he said, was that Iran and Saudi Arabia had substantial &quot;floating inventories&quot; of oil on tankers, amassed partly in anticipation of a price increase, and that they would now want to sell these stocks.</p> <p>OPEC ministers from three countries outside the Persian Gulf are scheduled to consult in Geneva today, and Nauman Barakat, an oil market specialist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, said they might ask the other ministers to join them. If the other ministers did attend, it would, in effect, move up the organization&#39;s next ministerial meeting, which is now scheduled for March 11, and cuts in production to stem the decline in prices could be discussed.</p> <p>Mr. Barakut said oil prices were likely to fall initially if the ground war was swift and successful because traders would expect a quicker return of Kuwaiti and Iraqi crude to the market, and that they would expect a worsening glut unless Saudi Arabia cut its production. But he added that continued high Saudi production probably would not mean a worsening glut because the Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil operations may not be repaired for many months.  Damage Assessment Ahead</p> <p>With allied forces moving into Kuwait, a clearer assessment of the damage to the country&#39;s oil industry is likely in the next few days. Before the war, Kuwait&#39;s exports were about 1.6 million barrels a day, about 7 percent of OPEC&#39;s total.</p> <p>Experts think that the Iraqi oil industry, which was about double Kuwait&#39;s production before the war, will take longer than Kuwait&#39;s to repair. When it will resume exporting oil is also complicated by the political issue of when international trade embargoes will be lifted.</p> <p>A more lingering effect, probably, will be the loss of Kuwait&#39;s refineries, which will take years to rebuild.</p> <p>But oil traders point out that the world learned months ago to live without Kuwaiti and Iraqi crude, and that the next few months are a relatively slack period for oil demand, as warmer weather approaches in most industrial countries. Some Not Convinced</p> <p>But not everyone is convinced that prices will stay low. &quot;All of the numbers, as best we can look at them, tend to show there is no particular oversupply anywhere,&quot; said Aivars Krasts, an economist for Conoco Inc. in Houston.</p> <p>If prices stay low, he said, it is probably because the market has begun to see the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as readily available. The reserve, which has been tapped twice by the Bush Administration, contains nearly 600 million barrels.</p> <p>At the Amoco Corporation, Theodore R. Eck, the chief economist, added that a quick war could raise demand for oil by &quot;getting the issue behind us&quot; for Europe, Japan and especially the United States, thus encouraging an upturn in economic activity and a rise in demand for oil products.</p> <p>The end of the war should mean less volatility in oil markets, he said, because OPEC would be better able to predict demand and supply. Demand for Revenue</p> <p>Mr. Eck said that the war would create a vast demand for more revenue in the Middle East, and that this was likely to push up prices. In the past, he said, OPEC &quot;has not been a short-term profit-maximizing operation.&quot;</p> <p>Some members, he said, had been willing to settle for lower prices in the short term so that oil would maintain its share of the world energy market and industrial countries would not find substitutes or learn to do without, a step that would mean hard times for exporters in decades to come.</p> <p>Now, he said, rebuilding could cost $150 billion or more, and &quot;everyone in the Middle East is going to have desperate requirements for more revenue, and nobody will take the long-term view.&quot;</p>
548248>It Burns More Cleanly, but Ethanol Still Raises Air-Quality Concerns Ethanol, an alternative fuel made from farm products like corn, is closely linked with the national effort to clean up the air. But a fierce battle is under way in Washington over whether it is a cure for pollution or a cause. Late last week, after days of maneuvering by supporters of the fuel, the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, and the minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, sent a letter to the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency arguing that the intent of Congress was to allow ethanol in the new, cleaner gasoline required in the nine dirtiest cities by 1995 under the Clean Air Act amendments adopted two years ago.  <p>The scientific validity of such an argument is unclear, however, because adding ethanol to gasoline makes the fuel more prone to evaporation, and the evaporation of chemicals is a major step in the formation of smog. It is for that reason that the E.P.A. had been preparing to issue regulations under the act that would have penalized the fuel, but the White House blocked the agency earlier this year.  Yeutter&#39;s &#39;Good Payoff&#39;</p> <p>Blocking those regulations was a defeat for the states, which face penalties if they fail to meet the Clean Air Act standards. And the White House action prolonged the uncertainty for the oil companies, which need to know what they can sell, since some regulations take effect in November. But the ethanol lobby -- mostly farm-state senators including Mr. Dole, and an Illinois company that produces most of the nation&#39;s supply -- see the White House decision as a victory.</p> <p>Clayton K. Yeutter, the former Secretary of Agriculture who is President Bush&#39;s chief domestic adviser, said the delay represented &quot;one of the times when the agriculture industry got good payoff from my being in the White House.&quot; Mr. Yeutter made the comment before the National Cattlemen&#39;s Association in March.</p> <p>Among the opponents of widespread ethanol use is Thomas Jorling, the New York State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, who said, &quot;there is a use for alcohol fuels, but I suspect they are limited to areas that don&#39;t have air pollution problems.&quot;</p> <p>The state Attorney General apparently agrees. After one New York retailer, Northville Industries, started mixing ethanol with its gasoline and advertising &quot;the clean air gasoline,&quot; it was challenged by the Attorney General and agreed to drop the claims and pay $20,000 in costs. Cleaner, but Not Perfect</p> <p>Proponents argue that ethanol is an American-made replacement for imported oil, created from renewable resources. They push ethanol as the ingredient needed to produce the &quot;oxygenated&quot; gasoline that the Clean Air Act requires, incorporating oxygen molecules into the fuel to reduce the carbon monoxide emissions from tailpipes.</p> <p>Some of this is true. Ethanol does come from agricultural products, although most farmers use diesel fuel to plant and harvest them. And ethanol does, in fact, burn cleanly. But it also increases &quot;evaporative emissions&quot; of smog-causing chemicals by about 25 percent, compared with gasoline that contains no ethanol. The Clean Air Act requires, in a different section, that emissions of those chemicals, called volatile organic compounds, be cut by 15 percent.</p> <p>Opponents of ethanol point out that the fuel is roughly twice as expensive as unleaded gasoline, and they say that it would have disappeared from the marketplace entirely but for a subsidy of about $19 a barrel from the Federal Government, in the form of an exemption from a 5.4-cent-a-gallon gasoline excise tax if the fuel is 10 percent ethanol. Some states add to the subsidy by giving breaks on their taxes, too.  The Powerful Ethanol Lobby</p> <p>To the extent that ethanol has been adopted, its opponents complain, the blame should go to what they see as greedy and politically influential producers.</p> <p>Those producers had agreed to the regulations for new fuel, after laborious negotiations with environmentalists, refiners and the staff of the E.P.A. The rules set limits on a characteristic of gasoline called vapor pressure, which measures the fuel&#39;s tendency to evaporate.</p> <p>But the ethanol lobby is now seeking an amendment to allow ethanol even though it increases the vapor pressure. Such a waiver exists in other parts of the Clean Air Act, and ethanol backers say they assumed, wrongly, that it carried over into the rules for gasoline that will take full effect in 1995. Their fuel is so clean-burning, they say, that the extra volatility will not hurt the air.</p> <p>&quot;They&#39;ve got a sob story based on a lie,&quot; David Doniger, an air pollution expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said of the ethanol lobby. &quot;Their fix is based on a fraud, that there are these wonderful qualities of ethanol that offset this extra volatility.&quot;</p> <p>The E.P.A., despite the regulations it had formerly planned to issue, is currently considering a waiver for ethanol.  A Summertime Problem</p> <p>The debate centers on regulations for gasoline sold during the summer, the worst time of year for some types of air pollution.</p> <p>Regardless of the outcome, ethanol will continue to have a role in reducing carbon monoxide concentrations in winter, when evaporation and ozone formation are less of a problem. Some cities&#39; biggest air pollution problems are caused by wintertime carbon monoxide.</p> <p>From a public policy standpoint, the debate over summertime use would be more clear cut if the interests of those involved were a little less commercial.</p> <p>The main opponents to using ethanol are the oil companies, which have demonstrated a willingness to say almost anything to stop government tinkering with fuel regulations, and have predicted doom at even simple changes. The main proponent is the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, of Decatur, Ill., which produces 700 million to 750 million gallons of ethanol a year, about two-thirds of the national supply. The State and Local View</p> <p>The company now makes $50 million to $65 million a year on ethanol, about a tenth of its total earnings, said John M. McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Securities. If the company gets the rule change it is seeking, it could earn substantially more, he said.</p> <p>Mr. Yeutter, the President&#39;s adviser, in a telephone interview, explained the &quot;payoff&quot; comment he had made earlier this year: &quot;It&#39;s a payoff in the sense of me making sure that ethanol was treated fairly rather than unfairly. We&#39;re not asking for any special privilege, we&#39;re trying to make sure that ethanol doesn&#39;t get zapped in this process.&quot;</p> <p>Scientific evidence on the question of smog, he said, is still developing.</p> <p>But the evidence is already sufficient in the view of many state and local air pollution officials, like Mr. Jorling of New York State. &quot;Every time a state comes in with a strategy and attempts to reduce ozone precursors, and that provision runs afoul of one of political constituencies of the Administration,&quot; he complained, &quot;the Administration comes down on the side of industry, and tries to repeal what the state is adopting.&quot;</p> <p>A recent study by Common Cause, the Washington-based government watchdog group, found that the Archer-Daniels-Midland chairman, Wayne O. Andreas, his family and the company&#39;s political action committee have given nearly $2.8 million in political contributions in the last decade. A Proponent of Ethanol</p> <p>At the Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group in Washington to which Archer-Daniels refers all comment on ethanol, Kim R. Pearson, the general counsel, said hostility by the states to ethanol was &quot;residual resentment over our ability to get the excise-tax exemption extended two years ago.&quot; The big oil companies do not like ethanol, he said, because it replaces crude oil that would otherwise go through their refineries.</p> <p>Mr. Pearson said ethanol would not make the air worse, even if it increased evaporative emissions of volatile organic chemicals, because it improves engine burning so much that emissions of volatile organics through the tailpipe are reduced.</p> <p>And carbon monoxide, along with being a regulated pollutant and a direct hazard, also contributes to smog formation, Mr. Pearson said, so cutting the carbon monoxide output helps hold down smog.</p> <p>A study paid for by the oil companies and the car manufacturers, released earlier this year, said ethanol would make smog worse. A study sponsored by the ethanol producers found the opposite, but the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry&#39;s main trade association, picked it apart and Mr. Pearson later acknowledged that some of the study&#39;s assumptions were faulty.</p>
1304086>Judge Objects to F.A.A. Plan for No-Bid Contract to Lockheed An administrative law judge has found that the Federal Aviation Administration&#39;s intention to give a huge air traffic control modernization contract to the Lockheed Martin Corporation without competitive bidding is premature. The judge said he based the ruling on the fact that the agency had only a vague idea of how the new system would function. The contract would replace the computing systems in the nation&#39;s long-distance high-altitude air traffic control centers.  <p>The F.A.A. has said that its current computers, replaced in anticipation of Year 2000 problems, will not be maintainable beyond 2007 and it wants to give the job to Lockheed partly because it did not have time for a full-scale competition. But the Raytheon Company filed a protest.</p> <p>The judge said that there was &#39;&#39;no rational basis&#39;&#39; for some of the arguments advanced by the agency.</p> <p>The ruling is an unusual look by an outsider into the F.A.A.&#39;s system of contracting. The agency&#39;s administrator, Jane Garvey, sent the dispute to the General Services Administration when she disqualified herself from ruling on the issue, because she had favored the no-bid approach.</p> <p>Congress has exempted the F.A.A. from federal procurement rules, and given it the authority to devise its own bidding system. But the judge, Stephen M. Daniels, found that the agency was not following its own rule, and, he said, &#39;&#39;The F.A.A. has not specified what it is looking for.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In a statement, the F.A.A. said that in keeping with the ruling, which was technically only a recommendation because the General Services Administration does not have jurisdiction, the air traffic agency would &#39;&#39;complete defining its requirements before deciding on its future acquisition strategy.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;The specific actions and dates are still to be determined,&#39;&#39; the agency said.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the F.A.A. posted a notice on its Web site saying that it intended to give the job to Lockheed, but that other companies could submit proposals if they had competence in each of six specialized areas. Raytheon argued that two of those involved detailed knowledge of the existing system, that only Lockheed Martin has because of its previous work with the F.A.A.</p> <p>The ruling by Mr. Daniels said that the agency&#39;s conclusion that only Lockheed Martin &#39;&#39;could provide best value to the agency in modernizing the system is also based on nothing more than the repeated vision of F.A.A. officials.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The F.A.A. said it wanted to use Lockheed Martin to reduce the risk of technical failure, delay and cost overrun. But, the judge found that  since the agency had not specified what it wants and the company has submitted no proposal, that conclusion &#39;&#39;makes no sense.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The F.A.A.&#39;s track record in modernization projects is poor. From the mid-1980&#39;s to the mid-1990&#39;s it tried to replace the computing system that handles lower-altitude traffic, but decided that most of the system could not be made to work. At least $500 million was wasted on software that could not be reused.</p>
1631018>New High-Tech Passports Raise Concerns of Snooping The State Department will soon begin issuing passports that carry information about the traveler in a computer chip embedded in the cardboard cover as well as on its printed pages. Privacy advocates say the new format -- developed in response to security concerns after the Sept. 11 attacks -- will be vulnerable to electronic snooping by anyone within several feet, a practice called skimming. Internal State Department documents, obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union under the Freedom of Information Act, show that Canada, Germany and Britain have raised the same concern.  <p>&#39;&#39;This is like putting an invisible bull&#39;s-eye on Americans that can be seen only by the terrorists,&#39;&#39; said Barry Steinhardt, the director of the A.C.L.U. Technology and Liberty Program. &#39;&#39;If there&#39;s any nation in the world at the moment that could do without such a device, it is the United States.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The organization wants the State Department to take security precautions like encrypting the data, so that even if it is downloaded by unauthorized people, it cannot be understood.</p> <p>In a telephone interview, Frank E. Moss, deputy assistant secretary of state for passport services, said the skimming problem &#39;&#39;can be dealt with.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We are certainly still working hard on the question of whether additional security measures should be taken,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The technology is familiar to the public in applications like highway toll-collection systems and &#39;&#39;smart cards&#39;&#39; for entering buildings or subway turnstiles. In passports, the technology would be more sophisticated, with a computer having the ability to query the chip selectively for particular information. The chip, expected to cost about $8, would hold 64 kilobytes of data, the same as early personal computers.</p> <p>Last month the Government Printing Office awarded $373,000 in contracts to four manufacturers to design the passports, which would contain chips that stored all the printed data on the passport, as well as digitized data on the traveler&#39;s face.</p> <p>At an airport immigration checkpoint, an antenna could read a passport waved a few inches away. A digital camera could look at the traveler&#39;s face and compare it with the data from the passport chip.</p> <p>The problem, though, is that the passport might be read by others, too. According to one document obtained by the A.C.L.U., a State Department memo from September detailing negotiations on the subject, the American position is that the data &#39;&#39;should be able to be read by anyone who chooses to invest in the infrastructure to do so.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Steinhardt of the A.C.L.U. described a test in which a chip was read from 30 feet away, but Mr. Moss of the State Department said that was in a laboratory and would be hard to duplicate in the field.</p> <p>Government officials from the United States, Canada and western European countries, and chip manufacturing experts, have been discussing standards for chips in passports for more than two years under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization, which is affiliated with the United Nations and promulgates a variety of standards for aviation. Mr. Steinhardt complained that the organization had ignored the civil liberties group&#39;s request to participate in sessions when standards were discussed.</p> <p>The State Department, which issues about seven million passports a year, hopes to begin issuing a limited number with chips early next year, initially to government employees.</p> <p>To combat passport fraud and theft, the government will soon require all visitors who do not need visas to enter the United States -- those who are deemed low security risks because of the countries they come from -- to carry passports that are machine-readable and contain &#39;&#39;biometric&#39;&#39; information like fingerprints or facial measurements.</p> <p>Australia is already issuing passports with chips, and others will follow soon, Mr. Moss said. And since passport requirements are usually reciprocal, the United States anticipates that those countries will demand similar features on American passports.</p> <p>Neville G. Pattinson, the director of business development, technology and government affairs at Axalto, one of the vendors, said the problem with encryption was that the chip had to be readable by governments all over the world. But, he said, &#39;&#39;there is a considerable concern over skimming.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The chips raise the possibility of someone &#39;&#39;brushing against you with the equipment, in a briefcase or another disguise, and hoping they can read it out of your pocket or purse,&#39;&#39; Mr. Pattinson said. Another possibility is someone embedding a reader in a doorway, he said.</p> <p>But he said low-cost fixes were available. One would incorporate a layer of metal foil into the cover of the passport so it could be read only when opened.</p> <p>Another would put a password into the printed information in the passport. A reader would optically scan for the password, which would be visible only when the passport was open, and then use it to obtain data from the chip.</p> <p>Another possibility would be to keep the passport in a foil pouch, like those issued with highway toll-collection devices so they can be carried through a toll booth without being read. In multilateral discussions, though, some experts said they feared that terrorists would use the pouches to smuggle weapons.</p> <p>The A.C.L.U. is seeking to portray the new passports as part of a continuing loss of privacy.</p> <p>In March, the A.C.L.U. and 12 other organizations from North America, Europe and Asia signed a letter to the aviation organization saying they were &#39;&#39;increasingly concerned that the biometric travel document initiative is part and parcel of a larger surveillance infrastructure monitoring the movement of individuals globally.&#39;&#39;</p>
803905>Congress Uses A Budget Bill To Reshape The F.A.A. Impatient with the subcommittees that are trying to reshape the Federal Aviation Administration, House and Senate budget conferees have done the job themselves, appending the result to the transportation appropriations bill. Borrowing from the House and Senate versions of legislation, which have been the subject of contentious hearings for weeks, the conferees last week voted to exempt the aviation agency from Federal procurement procedures and from most Civil Service protections for its employees. The exemptions are long-held goals of the agency, which contends that to modernize the air traffic control system, it needs to operate with more flexibility, like a private corporation.  <p>But because of repeated failures this summer in aging air traffic control equipment, the momentum for change has increased.</p> <p>The conferees did not give the agency another provision it wanted, new user fees, to address the long-term question of financing that the agency says it faces.</p> <p>The F.A.A. expects to need more money in the future because of anticipated growth in air traffic, and it wants new user fees to pay for operations. The Congressional budget resolution calls for gradual elimination of financing from the Treasury&#39;s general revenues, now about $2 billion a year, and does not propose any new sources of money.</p> <p>The conferees approved a Transportation Department budget of $8.2 billion for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, about $100 million less than the previous fiscal year, and about $100 million less than the Administration had sought.</p> <p>But it also gave the Department of Transportation the authority to shift money from the Coast Guard to the aviation agency if needed.</p> <p>&quot;We&#39;re pleased that we have access to enough money now to perform vital safety missions,&quot; said Steven O. Palmer, Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Governmental affairs.</p> <p>Mr. Palmer added that it was urgent that rules governing personnel and procurement be changed because the current regulations &quot;forbid the F.A.A. from moving the right people to the right location, quickly and effectively.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;They have this cumbersome procurement process, having to document every step of the process, and fearing lawsuits every time an award is made,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Indeed, the procurement system had no defenders in the hearings before the House and Senate aviation subcommittees. But the personnel system is another matter, and unions representing the air traffic controllers and the equipment technicians said last week that their existence was threatened by the personnel changes. They plan to ask the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which is holding its annual convention this week in New York, to pass a resolution calling for a veto by President Clinton.</p> <p>However, Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena issued a statement generally supportive of the compromise, and praising the inclusion of changes in the personnel system.</p> <p>The conference language gives the F.A.A. administrator until Jan. 1 to devise a new personnel and procurement system that would take effect on April 1. The aviation subcommittees could pre-empt that system if they can write legislation and have it approved by Congress by April 1.</p> <p>Representative John J. Duncan, the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, said that the F.A.A. often missed deadlines and could fail to come up with a plan by Jan. 1, leaving little time for review. Further, he said, the complex changes have been under debate for years and should go through the normal legislative process.</p> <p>The unions are objecting for another reason: They could lose rules on transfers and schedules that are now the subject of negotiation, and, they claim, they could even lose the right to organize.</p> <p>&quot;They can do anything they want, a complete blank check for the administrator,&quot; said Michael P. McNally, a vice president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. The unions recently have been among the most vocal critics of the aviation agency, accusing it of being stingy with training time and allowing the work force to shrink, creating a threat of severe shortages as many workers become eligible for retirement.</p> <p>But House Republicans contend there is no plan to dissolve the unions. The conference report says, in part: &quot;The conferees believe that a harmonious management-labor relationship within the F.A.A. is important to the effectiveness and efficiency of the national airspace system. The conferees do not intend that the personnel management reforms included in this bill force the disestablishment of any existing management-labor agreement or lead to the dissolution of any union.&quot;</p>
1740421>Arriving Planes to Line Up Closer Together Above City Planes approaching airports in New York will be permitted to fly closer together in a trial period beginning Monday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, which says it is trying to fine-tune its standards to improve traffic flow without diminishing safety. But the 90-day trial comes amid an extended dispute between the agency and the air traffic controllers&#39; union about how many employees are required to meet safety standards. Last year the union pointed out scores of cases in which planes were too close together, violations that the F.A.A. did not know existed.  <p>The agency recorded more than 270 of these &#39;&#39;operational errors&#39;&#39; in low-altitude traffic in the New York area last year, cases in which planes under the jurisdiction of an air traffic controller were found to be too close together, up from 24 the previous year.</p> <p>It is trying to separate the violations into those that are important from those that Bruce Johnson, vice president of the Air Traffic Organization of the F.A.A., called &#39;&#39;ticky-tack.&#39;&#39; The rules cover planes being supervised by the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, known as a Tracon. Around the country, Tracon rules state that planes in line to land must be at least three miles apart, or the controller is charged with a violation and sent for retraining. After three violations, a controller can be fired.</p> <p>But supervisors also pressure the controllers to keep separations as close to three miles as possible, to achieve as many landings as possible. Controllers generally herd planes into a line at an altitude of about 20,000 feet, beginning several miles from the end of the runway. Like cars approaching a toll booth, the planes at the front of the line slow down as they prepare to land, especially as they lower their landing gear. As they slow, distance between them and planes behind them shrinks.</p> <p>The problem, according to managers, is that if a plane puts its gear down early, or runs into headwinds as it descends, the plane behind can come too close.</p> <p>Last year the controllers, angry that the F.A.A. was reducing staffing levels at the Tracon, anonymously reported dozens of operational errors, mostly involving &#39;&#39;compression&#39;&#39; of planes lined up to land. F.A.A. officials, reviewing tapes of radar displays, were surprised to discover that it was apparently common practice for controllers to squeeze planes slightly closer than three miles apart. The F.A.A. then began random audits of the tapes, and discovered numerous other errors. The error rate was found to be six times higher than previously reported.</p> <p>Mr. Johnson, with the F.A.A., said in a telephone interview that controllers were being penalized for errors so small that it required intense analysis to find them. At first glance, he said, looking at a radar playback, &#39;&#39;You&#39;d be patting that controller on the back saying, &#39;Hey, great job.&#39; &#39;&#39;</p> <p>The F.A.A. is trying to develop a computer program that would sound an alarm when an operational error occurs, raising the possibility that the rate of known errors would jump even higher. In the last few months, though, it has also retrained controllers to try to reduce violations of the three-mile rule.</p> <p>Under the policy that will be enforced beginning on Monday, the separation standard will remain at three miles, but controllers will not be charged with errors for occasional incidents in which planes become closer than three miles. The F.A.A. plans to try the same policy in the Chicago area, and in Charlotte, N.C., Dallas/Fort Worth and Southern California.</p> <p>The president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association in New York at Tracon, Dean Iacopelli, said that in the last few months, two controllers had been suspended for 10 days, and two for four days, for making errors, and seven more were told, &#39;&#39;One more operational error, and we&#39;re firing you.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Phil Barbarello, a regional vice president of the national union, said that F.A.A. has also threatened to fire controllers if they leave too much space between airplanes.</p> <p>Both men said they thought the agency was making the change to avoid embarrassment over a high number of errors, but Mr. Johnson said the trial would give controllers confidence and help traffic flow.</p>
1490716>Advances in Airplanes Are Mostly Invisible IF the thrill of air travel hadn&#39;t already vanished, a traveler could conclude that the last wisp of it disappeared last month with the announcement by British Airways and Air France that they were retiring the Concorde later this year. Now that the only supersonic passenger plane is heading for the museum, where has the innovation gone? If it is still there, it is decidedly not in speed. Boeing found this out last year when it tried to sell a 250-seat Sonic Cruiser, a striking passenger plane that would have flown 15 to 20 percent faster than most commercial models -- at nearly the speed of sound, cutting a couple of hours off long trans-Pacific flights. Engineers liked the planes but airline purchasing managers responded with a resounding silence. Among airlines, many contemplating bankruptcy, there was no market for even that modest speed improvement.  <p>But innovation still exists, according to aviation experts. It has simply moved to places that few air travelers will notice, or care about. One is lower operating costs. Last December, when Boeing dropped the Sonic Cruiser, it began work on a new model that would be 17 to 20 percent more fuel-efficient than the Boeing 767.</p> <p>In contrast, the Concorde used about twice as much fuel per passenger as the long-haul jet it was built to compete with, the Boeing 747. Sir Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, made a bid to keep flying the planes if they were sold to him for a nominal £1, but even with Virgin&#39;s lower operating costs, airline experts say it would be hard to turn a profit. The plane lacks the basic elements of the jetliners that airlines buy these days.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It&#39;s the two-person crew, the fuel efficiency, all those things that sell an airline on an airplane,&#39;&#39; said Donna Corbutt, an aviation historian in Reading, Mass., near Boston. &#39;&#39;The manufacturers don&#39;t sell the public on an airplane now; they&#39;re selling to the airlines,&#39;&#39; she said. The Concorde requires two pilots and a flight engineer; the only other plane in common use that does that, the Boeing 727, is also headed toward extinction. Younger planes are more automated and fly with two pilots and no engineer.</p> <p>Ms. Corbutt said: &#39;&#39;To me, being on a 747 is still the be-all and end-all. Now they&#39;re all the same.&#39;&#39; But she and other airplane experts say that distinctive planes like the 747, with its bulbous front and spiral stairway, were hurt in the 1980&#39;s by deregulation of flights over the Atlantic. Places like Pittsburgh and Atlanta became international gateways, and the result was a market for smaller planes like Boeing 767&#39;s. That diffusion of traffic, which brought Europe closer to people in the American South and Midwest, did not help planes like the Concorde.</p> <p>Only two major American passenger airlines still fly the 747: United and Northwest. The others fly planes that are less distinctive, like Boeing 777&#39;s or Airbus A-300&#39;s.</p> <p>Other innovations are invisible to the public and designed to stay that way. For example, the engines on big airplanes send continuous reports on their operation to a satellite that beams them back to the company maintenance headquarters; another set of cockpit instruments compares the plane&#39;s location, measured by satellite, to the location of mountains all over the world, to assure that a mechanically sound airplane will not fly into a cloud-covered peak.</p> <p>There is one area of innovation that is obvious to the public, and that is size, as planes get both larger and smaller. But it is not entirely to the public&#39;s liking.</p> <p>In the last few years, as full-sized jetliners like the early Boeing 737&#39;s begin to accumulate in storage, retired at least temporarily and possibly forever by changing business conditions, airlines have been pushed to use planes with greater fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, and a swarm of smaller jets, with about half as many seats, has taken to the skies. They are called regional jets, but they are often used on the same routes that the bigger planes fly.</p> <p>At the other end, Airbus expects its double-decker A-380 to be in commercial service in 2008, after $10 billion in development costs. Early concepts for the extra space included amenities like a cocktail bar, a gym or sleeping rooms, but airline experts predict it will simply be a more massive version of mass transportation, seating up to 550 people.</p> <p>One change for people on ordinary planes may be Internet access. Lufthansa and Boeing declared success in April for their three-month experiment on a 747 that flies from Dulles to Frankfurt. An average of 50 to 80 passengers used the service simultaneously, connecting to the Internet at high speeds, either by plugging into a jack or using a wireless connection. Other airlines seem likely to follow, providing the amenities of the office at 35,000 feet.</p> <p>TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT&#39;S REPORT  Correction:  June 1, 2003, Sunday  The Correspondents Report column on May 18, about technical advances in airplanes, misspelled the surname of an aviation historian.

656066>Report Sees Explosion Risk at Energy Dept. Plants Eleven nuclear processing factories in six states may be vulnerable to the same kind of chemical explosion that spread radioactive contamination in a wide area around a Russian plant last April, according to a report by the staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. The April explosion, which contaminated nearly 50 square miles around the Siberian city of Tomsk-7, involved chemical compounds that are used in American plants run by the Department of Energy, according to the report. At most of those plants, plutonium for bombs is separated from other materials in processing tanks.  <p>&quot;The potential risk here in the United States is real and widespread at several D.O.E. plants,&quot; said Senator John Glenn of Ohio, the chairman of the committee, which has been investigating safety at the nuclear weapons plants for years.</p> <p>The Energy Department had no comment yesterday. In the past, engineers working for the contractors who run the plants have raised the possibility of such explosions in processing tanks, but the department has not been able to say how big the risk is.</p> <p>Yesterday the staff of the committee stopped short of saying for certain that there is a risk, because the contents of the American tanks are so poorly understood. Still, at the Hanford reservation, in Washington State, some waste tanks are already being watched for the buildup of hydrogen, a gas that can burn or explode. Other tanks are believed to be in danger of exploding because of a different type of organic chemical, ferrocyanides.</p> <p>The report was made public yesterday in Washington, but because the Senate is in recess, the committee has not voted on its findings.</p> <p>The committee&#39;s staff found a risk at Hanford, which has several factories; at the Savannah River Site, in South Carolina; at Oak Ridge, Tenn.; at Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico; at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Springs, and at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, in Ohio. The first five are involved in bomb making, but the last is where different types of uranium are sorted for use in reactors, including civilian power plants.</p> <p>Explosions or other accidents involving the chemicals occurred at Savannah River in 1953 and 1973 and at Hanford in 1953. Like the explosion at Tomsk, these were chemical reactions, not nuclear ones, but because the tanks held radioactive material, there was a risk of nuclear contamination.</p> <p>The chemicals, red oils, which are used in extracting the plutonium, can settle into a dense layer and explode.</p> <p>&quot;I want to emphasize that no red oils or related compounds have been found in storage tanks,&quot; said Senator Glenn. The storage tanks, where the radioactive materials are held after processing, would be of particular concern because they are huge, some holding more than a million gallons, and an explosion could spread radiation over a large area. But he added that the presence of red oils in the smaller processing tanks &quot;should be concern enough for D.O.E.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;This potential problem cuts across the D.O.E.&#39;s various programs in a manner which may require a more formal, disciplined and uniform approach to ensure adequate safety margins are provided,&quot; Mr. Glenn said in a letter to the Energy Secretary, Hazel R. O&#39;Leary.</p>
1748553>Agency Sees Little Risk From a Leak At Indian Point The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said in a report released yesterday that the risk from the tritium-contaminated water leaking from the Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor is so small that it is unlikely to affect the health of plant workers or the public. The leak was discovered last fall next to the spent-fuel pool for Indian Point 2, which is in Westchester County, as workers dug a new foundation for a crane that will take fuel out of the pool for storage in dry casks.  <p>Water in the pool is contaminated with tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen that is incorporated into the water just as normal hydrogen is. Several weeks ago, samples from a new monitoring well found that the tritium has come closer to the Hudson River than previously believed, although the presumption since the leak&#39;s discovery was that the tritium would eventually reach the river.</p> <p>In its report, the commission said it had &#39;&#39;not found any condition that indicates that occupational or public health and safety have been, or likely will be, affected by the current onsite groundwater contamination.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The commission said it had reviewed, and did not dispute, an estimate by the plant owner, Entergy, that the largest direct exposure that a member of the public could receive from the leaking tritium was less than one ten-thousandth of 1 percent of the maximum that the plant is allowed to cause by leaking liquids. The figure refers only to the leak, and not from the routine, planned releases of slightly radioactive liquids into the Hudson River. Those are far larger than the amount being leaked, but still well below legal limits, plant operators say.</p> <p>The dose would be minuscule compared to background doses from natural sources, according to radiation experts.</p> <p>The report also noted that New York State had found a second radioactive material, strontium-90, in the water, but that the commission&#39;s own tests had not; it said that further tests were pending.</p>
263768>Energy Dept. to Pay $73 Million To Settle Uranium Case in Ohio The Energy Department promised yesterday to pay at least $73 million to settle claims by up to 24,000 neighbors of a nuclear weapon plant in Ohio that has spread uranium into water and air.  <p>The settlement was the first time the Government has acknowledged that a weapon production plant may have harmed large numbers of its neighbors. In a nonbinding trial before a Federal jury that ended two weeks ago, the department had maintained that the uranium it released was not harmful.</p> <p>The jury in that trial recommended payment of $136 million for the plant&#39;s neighbors, and the Energy Department said last night in announcing the settlement in Washington that it had been guided in part by that ruling. Emotional Distress Cited</p> <p>The Government did not acknowledge that the emissions at the plant, the Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald, made neighbors ill. Instead, it made the money available to pay claims of emotional distress, which the department had never done before. The money will also be available to compensate the neighbors for &#39;&#39;diminution of property values caused by the nuisance.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The settlement was described as tentative because it requires the approval of a Federal district judge in Cincinnati.</p> <p>Lawyers in the case said they expected a large part of the settlement would be used for studies of the health of people within five miles of the Fernald plant.</p> <p>While the settlement does not cover &#39;&#39;cancer claims, claims of genetic abnormality and other physical injury claims by members of the class,&#39;&#39; people who have such claims now or who become ill later and seek compensation could sue the Government later, according to a memorandum spelling out the settlement between the Department of Energy and the plaintiffs. Significance of Case</p> <p>The chief lawyer for the neighbors, Stanley M. Chesley, said the case had national significance because it was the first time that a private contractor operating a Government plant had been held liable. The contractor, NLO Inc., a subsidiary of NL Industries, had asserted that it could not be held liable because it was following Government orders, Mr. Chesley said.</p> <p>The settlement does not fix liability or blame for operations at the plant. Technically, the Federal Government will pay the $73 million on behalf of NL Industries.</p> <p>The $73 million will be divided under the direction of a special master who is to be appointed by the Federal district judge in Cincinnati. Mr. Chesley said the settlement could grow by $5 million when commercial property is included.</p> <p>Mr. Chesley said his clients had not sought damages for cancers, genetic defects and other physical effects because they lacked the health studies to show that such illnesses had been caused by the plant. This settlement will finance studies that could provide such evidence, he said. Blame Is Not Fixed</p> <p>Excluded from the settlement are claims that arise from &#39;&#39;contamination, sufficient to cause a serious threat to public health and safety, which is not now known because relevant information was purposefully withheld from plaintiffs, with fraudulent intent and with wanton disregard for the public health and safety,&#39;&#39; according to the memorandum.</p> <p>The Government has admitted it has little idea just how much uranium dust the plant has emitted since it opened in 1951. The most recent Government estimate was 394,000 to 552,000 pounds, but an estimate by a private researcher put the amount at up to five times that.</p> <p>In addition, because of the settlement, the Department of Energy eliminated the possiblity that a jury would impose punitive damages. The nonbinding trial was suggested by the Federal district judge in Cincinnati, S. Arthur Spiegel, as a way to lay the basis for a settlement. If no settlement had been reached, a full-scale trial would have been held. When the case was heard in June by a jury of eight, the members recommended that $55 million of their proposed $136 million award be for punitive damages.</p> <p>Louise Roselle, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said of that jury: &#39;&#39;We were able to convince this jury that they operated that plant with willful and wanton disregard for the health and safety of offsite residents. They were not only convinced, they were well convinced.&#39;&#39; Satisfaction Is Expressed</p> <p>She said she was satisfied with the settlement. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re happy primarily because our first obligation is to our clients,&#39;&#39; she said, &#39;&#39;and we feel this settlement will enable us to get for them the relief they need.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A lawyer for the Department of Energy, Henry A. Gill, drew a different conclusion from the trial. He said the jury&#39;s message was this: &#39;&#39;We think it&#39;s your responsibility to do some medical monitoring out there. People who have lived there are uncertain. We think you ought to spend some money to find out if there are any unusual health effectis in this population.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Gill, in a telephone interview last night, added: &#39;&#39;I think the department has done a wise thing here. It listened to that jury, and the jury said it had concerns, not about the present health of these people, but about what might be out there.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;From a public policy standpoint, it&#39;s a prudent and appropriate thing to have done. It&#39;s not the usual mechanism under which it&#39;s done, but this is the way it came out.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But Arjun Makhijani, an independent researcher and expert on the department&#39;s bomb production system, who served as an adviser to the plaintiff&#39;s lawyers, called the settlement &#39;&#39;a de-facto admission&#39;&#39; that the Government had done wrong. Earlier Settlements Made</p> <p>The agreement is unusual but not unprecedented in all respects. The Department of Energy agreed in 1981, as part of out-of-court settlments, to buy land near the Rocky Flats nuclear plant, outside Denver, that it had contaminated. It also established a $150 million fund to cover claims by residents of the Marshall Islands, in the South Pacific. The islands had been damaged by nuclear bomb tests.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the group that brought the suit, Lisa Crawford, said last night, &#39;&#39;I think we&#39;ve shown the world that the Department of Energy is wrong, that what they&#39;ve done to us is wrong, and that they&#39;re being penalized for it.&#39;&#39;</p>
1368997>Energy Department Recommends Yucca Mountain for Nuclear Waste Burial The Energy Department recommended this evening that President Bush designate Yucca Mountain, a volcanic ridge in the desert about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, as the main burial spot for radioactive wastes from the nation&#39;s nuclear power reactors and bomb production. The choice is the culmination of an $8 billion, 40-year search, but the project still faces many technological and political hurdles. One is that Nevada has said it will try to block the selection.  <p>In a letter accompanying his recommendation, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said, &#39;&#39;Yucca Mountain will bring together the location, natural barriers and design elements necessary to protect the health and safety of the public, including those Americans living in the immediate vicinity, now and long into the future.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The wastes will be dangerously radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. To win approval to open the site, the department must persuade safety regulators that leakage will be strictly limited for the first 10,000 years.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the president said last night that the White House had just received the recommendation and would not act tonight. Some opponents said they think the president will act as soon as Friday.</p> <p>After the president acts, Nevada  will have 60 days to file its objection, which would throw the issue into Congress, probably this summer. Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the deputy majority leader, has said he will fight it, as have other members of Nevada Congressional delegation.</p> <p>Mr. Reid said on the Senate floor shortly after the recommendation that Mr. Abraham&#39;s decision was &#39;&#39;hasty, poor and indefensible.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Abraham said in his letter that he based his decision on &#39;&#39;sound scientific principles,&#39;&#39; but Mr. Reid said, &#39;&#39;That science does not yet exist.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Opponents of the disposal plan have also mounted a campaign to convince elected officials around the country that shipment of the wastes is too risky.</p> <p>Mayor Oscar B. Goodman of Las Vegas said in a statement issued  before Mr. Abraham&#39;s letter was  made public: &#39;&#39;What a Valentine&#39;s day gift. Cupid shot nuclear-tipped arrows at the 43 states along the proposed transportation routes. What an expression of love for the country.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The Energy Department must win a license for the project from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, an independent agency. The department has not finished designing the repository or completed basic studies of how containers it proposes to use will corrode over the eons and how the rock will hold up under heat and radiation.</p> <p>Last month, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, an independent body created by Congress, reported that &#39;&#39;the technical basis for D.O.E.&#39;s repository performance estimates is weak-to-moderate at this time.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Still, the designation by the Energy Department is a major milestone in a process laid out by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. That bill foresaw a repository opening by January 1998, but the most recent goal is 2010, and most experts think it will be considerably later, if ever. The government has been searching for a repository site since the early 1960&#39;s.</p> <p>Mr. Abraham said another reason to open the repository was &#39;&#39;homeland security,&#39;&#39; an allusion to the risk of terrorist attacks on nuclear plants, either operating or retired, where large amounts of spent fuel are stored. But opponents are raising the same risk as an argument against shipments. The wastes are now stored at 131 locations in 39 states, according to the Energy Department.</p> <p>A judge has ruled that the department has breached its contracts with the utilities from which it has been taking money for 20 years in exchange for a promise to accept the wastes beginning four years ago.</p>
660045>Inquiry Into Radiation Tests Extends to Veterans The Energy Department is expanding its inquiry into improper use of human subjects in radiation experiments to determine whether patients in Veterans Administration hospitals were used, a department official said last night. The number of veterans involved, the nature of the experiments and when they were conducted are not clear, the official said. But he said that between the veterans and other subjects now coming to light, it appeared that &quot;at least 1,000&quot; people had been exposed to radiation for purposes clearly unrelated to their health.  <p>The department has acknowledged that it and its predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, sponsored experiments using a variety of subjects in a wide range of experiments in which the subjects were not properly informed about what was going to be done to them. Among the subjects were prisoners, retarded children and civilians who were believed to be terminally ill.</p> <p>The department established a toll-free number this month seeking information about radiation experiments, and the department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it soon began receiving calls from men who reported that they had been exposed to radiation in veterans hospitals</p> <p>The use of veterans in the experiments was first reported last night on the CBS Evening News.</p> <p>The experiments appear to have been performed under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Commission, acting as an agent for the Defense Department. For years the commission maintained a program under which it performed nuclear-related tasks at the behest of other Government agencies, most prominently the Pentagon, which wanted to know how much radiation soldiers could take before they became dysfunctional, and NASA, which wanted to know how radiation from the sun would affect astronauts.  Hundreds Affected</p> <p>The official said the Energy Department was also uncovering evidence of radiation experiments sponsored by other Federal agencies without the Atomic Energy Commission&#39;s involvement. Some of these, he said, have been mentioned before in public but never fully explored. For example, he said, the Defense Atomic Support Agency, which is now known as the Defense Nuclear Agency, paid the University of Cincinnati about $600,000 between 1960 and 1971 to irradiate 87 cancer patients.</p> <p>&quot;All but three of them were charity patients, with an average I.Q. of 86 and schooling of less than 10 years,&quot; the official said. &quot;We&#39;re talking about hundreds of rads, battlefield doses.&quot; In contrast, diagnostic x-rays are usually a small fraction of a rad, which is a unit of radiation dosage.</p> <p>The Cincinnati experiment&#39;s purpose, he said, was to determine what level of exposure would cause a soldier to &quot;not follow orders, be dysfunctional or throw up in his face mask in an airplane.&quot;</p> <p>Of the 87 patients, the official said, 9 died within 20 days. Army Test in Alaska</p> <p>The department is also looking into an Army study in the 1950&#39;s in which radioactive iodine was given to Eskimos or Indians in Alaska and to G.I.&#39;s stationed there, to study the function of the thyroid gland in cold weather. &quot;When you&#39;re dealing with people who were maybe a decade or two out of the Stone Age, there is a very big question about what constituted &#39;informed consent,&#39; &quot; the official said.</p> <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration signed a formal agreement in 1964 to have the Atomic Energy Commission perform radiation experiments on people, the official said, adding, &quot;Sooner or later this will lead us to a lot of different doorsteps.&quot;</p> <p>The Energy Department is still carrying out scores of radiation experiments for its own research and for other agencies, the official said. But, he added, these must all meet protocols established by the Food and Drug Administration or the National Institutes of Health and require informed consent.</p>
1599680>Looking Back and Looking Ahead, Panel Assesses the Opportunities for Prevention Transportation Security The nation&#39;s investment in improving transportation security has been too focused on passenger airlines, the commission said, arguing that the Transportation Security Administration was trying &#39;&#39;to fight the last war.&#39;&#39;  <p>&#39;&#39;Opportunities to do harm are as great, or greater&#39;&#39; in maritime or surface transportation, or cargo aviation or general aviation, the report says.</p> <p>Over 90 percent of the agency&#39;s $5.3 billion budget goes to airline security, the report says, and it is time to make hard choices in allocating limited resources.</p> <p>It says that defending mass transit is very difficult and that &#39;&#39;perfection is unattainable,&#39;&#39; but that spending should be based on a systematic analysis of risks, costs and benefits. &#39;&#39;Terrorists should perceive that potential targets are defended,&#39;&#39; the report says. &#39;&#39;They may be deterred by a significant chance of failure.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>And the aviation security system still has shortcomings, the commission said. One is that the United States has a comprehensive list of terrorists and terrorism suspects, the commission said, but is afraid to share it with the airlines, which carry out the current security system, called the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System, known as Capps. The Transportation Security Administration is trying to develop a more advanced system, called Capps 2, which it would operate directly. But Capps 2 would involve extensive use of computerized databases and has raised civil liberties concerns. The commission said that switching to a more extensive list for screening &#39;&#39;should not be delayed while the argument about a successor to Capps continues.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Capps relies on facts about passengers including how the ticket was paid for and whether the trip is one-way. Homeland Security officials have said that Capps is antiquated, but in the report&#39;s history of the events of Sept. 11, Capps identified eight of the 19 hijackers as suspicious.</p> <p>But at the time, Capps was intended only to foil suitcase bombers, and was used to assure that no baggage was loaded on a plane unless its owner was on board.</p> <p>MATTHEW L.

643361>After 20 Years, America&#39;s Foot Is Still On the Gas TWENTY years after the Arab oil embargo, after the gas lines, after the fist fights, after the nation&#39;s promise to itself to do better, some things have changed. Mostly they&#39;ve gotten worse. The United States today uses almost as much oil as it did then, but imports 44.6 percent of it, up from 37.2 percent in 1973. At the time of the embargo, 5.3 percent of the oil used here came from Arab members of Opec; now it is 11.6 percent. Then our largest supplier was Venezuela, which is geographically and culturally close to the United States; now it is Saudi Arabia, which is neither.  <p>Then, we imported oil to help drive our cars and trucks 1.3 trillion miles a year; today we drive 2.2 trillion.</p> <p>Some of the people most concerned about energy say none of this should come as a surprise. &quot;The only thing we learn from history is we learn nothing from history,&quot; said James Schlesinger, a former Defense Secretary and head of the C.I.A., who was the &quot;energy czar&quot; during the second oil crisis, in 1979.</p> <p>Everyone who thinks about it agrees that some supplies are shaky. Venezuela, now the second-largest supplier to this country, has had two coup attempts this year. Nigeria, No. 5, is also unstable. Saudi Arabia, No. 1 at 1.5 million barrels of the 8.5 million barrels imported each day, faces religious strains.</p> <p>Production from stable, friendly places, like Texas and Oklahoma, continues to dwindle; domestic production is down by about 2 million barrels a day over the 20-year period, despite tapping the Alaskan fields. The oil industry wants import tariffs or tax incentives, along with access to areas that environmentalists want protected.</p> <p>Environmentalists like heavier gasoline taxes, and on Oct. 1 the Federal tax rose 4.3 cents a gallon, as much as Congress could stand but not as much in the average motorist&#39;s weekly budget as a morning newspaper.</p> <p>&quot;Our energy policy is to take the cheapest oil in the world, regardless of source, and take our chances that it will continue to be cheap and available,&quot; said William K. Tell Jr., senior vice president of Texaco.</p> <p>On the consumption side, the problem is partly technology but mostly will. A Federal standard established after the embargo sets average mileage at 27.5, and the Environmental Protection Agency said in a recent report that manufacturers have no incentive to do better.  Accelerating Acceleration</p> <p>While the manufacturers are getting more from a gallon of gasoline these days, they are applying the gains to performance, not mileage. The average time to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles an hour was 14 seconds in 1974, and is now about 11.5 seconds, thanks to multi-valve engines and other technical improvements. If Detroit had interrupted that trend in 1984, when the average time was about 13.4 seconds, and applied all subsequent improvements to fuel economy, average miles per gallon would be about 30 instead of 27.5, the agency believes.</p> <p>&quot;We have testosterone cars instead of efficient cars,&quot; said Daniel F. Becker, an energy expert at the Sierra Club in Washington.</p> <p>Detroit does, in fact, build some efficient cars. The Coalition for Vehicle Choice, a lobby backed by the auto makers, analyzed the E.P.A. statistics on the 1994 models and pointed out that the 10 models with the highest ratings, 43 miles a gallon to 58 miles a gallon, &quot;represent less than 2 percent of all passenger cars sold.&quot; Mr. Becker&#39;s response is that Detroit doesn&#39;t try very hard to sell the efficient ones.</p> <p>But the trend to indulge the vehicular equivalent of hormones leads some consumers into vehicles less efficient than cars. &quot;The industry&#39;s gone to tremendous efforts to improve the fuel economy of cars, but for the fleet as a whole we&#39;re losing it to trucks,&quot; said Robert M. Heavenrich, an automotive specialist at the E.P.A., who noted that 4 of 10 vehicles sold are light-duty trucks. Among the top 10 most popular vehicles in the last model year were four pickups and a van.</p> <p>Intermittent schemes to get people out of cars do not get very far. A recent book on Americans and their cars, &quot;Where the Road and the Sky Collide,&quot; by K. T. Berger, (Henry Holt, $22.50) says even the most casual observer would conclude that the car and driver are &quot;the dominant life-form roaming the countryside.&quot;</p> <p>President Clinton recently announced a program to put idle nuclear bomb scientists to work helping the industry make an 80-mile-a-gallon car. A tall order, but maybe more likely than getting drivers to take the bus.</p> <p>Are there any grounds for optimism? Maybe a few.</p> <p>For one, the world&#39;s largest oil producer, the Soviet Union, collapsed in the early 90&#39;s with barely a ripple in the market. For another, some exporting companies are unlikely now to cut off supplies to consuming nations&#39; distributors, because the exporters are the distributors; the Saudis own half of Texaco&#39;s eastern retailing system, and the Venezuelans have invested heavily in Citgo.</p> <p>There is no more Soviet Union to march into the Persian Gulf. At least at the moment, there is no more Arab-Israeli conflict. And there is recent evidence, from the invasion of Kuwait, that war in the oil fields does not mean a catastrophic reduction in supplies.</p> <p>Charles DiBona, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, said, &quot;Although we&#39;re importing a larger fraction, there&#39;s also more oil in the world than there was then.&quot; It seems unlikely, but world reserves now are nearly 50 times annual consumption, the highest ratio ever.</p> <p>&quot;The idea that we&#39;re running out is getting to be sort of weak,&quot; he said. &quot;The idea of weaning yourself off oil with expensive methods makes less sense.&quot;</p> <p>There are reasons to be wary of imports, though, he said, among them the tremendous cost. In 1973, spending on oil imports was $23.9 billion, and total trade deficit was a paltry $3.9 billion; last year, oil imports cost $44.8 billion and total deficit was $84.5 billion.</p> <p>Eventually, the habit will have to change, said Mr. Becker of the Sierra Club. The deciding factor may not be the stability of distant countries; it may turn out to be pollution or global warming, or the realization that this resource should be shared with future generations. No matter how much oil is found, Mr. Becker said, it is a finite resource: &quot;After all, they&#39;re not making new dinosaurs.&quot;</p> <p>THE NATION</p>
289826>Five Exchanges Weighing Move To Jersey City The five commodity exchanges in New York, outgrowing their space in the World Trade Center, are considering moving to Jersey City and are talking to municipal officials on both sides of the Hudson River to see which could provide a better package of tax breaks and other inducements.  <p>The exchanges, now in cramped quarters at 4 World Trade Center, provide jobs for 5,000 people, with 15,000 more indirectly involved. The exchanges pay tens of millions of dollars annually to the city and state, directly or through employees&#39; taxes, exchange officials said.</p> <p>Z. Lou Guttman, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the largest of the five, told reporters visiting the exchange yesterday, &#39;&#39;There&#39;s a premium we&#39;re willing to spend to stay in New York, but it&#39;s not a big premium.&#39;&#39; The reporters had gathered for a lunch to introduce the new president of the exchange, R. Patrick Thompson. &#39;Very Concrete Proposals&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Guttman said that the exchanges had considered seven sites and now had one prime site in lower Manhattan, a secondary site in that area and a prime site in New Jersey, which, he said, was less than 10 minutes from Manhattan by mass transit. Without naming Jersey City, said, &#39;&#39;The New Jersey entity is starting to make very concrete proposals.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Officials in New York and Jersey City confirmed that they were discussing inducements with the exchanges. New York has programs to provide property-tax breaks, low-interest construction loans and other benefits. A spokesman for Jersey City, Roger Jones, said his city would stress a lower cost of doing business and the availability of land and workers.</p> <p>The other exchanges are the Commodity Exchange Inc., the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the Cotton Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange, which is affiliated with the New York Stock Exchange.</p> <p>The Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, Stanley E. Grayson, said that New York had discussed offering inducements to the exchanges, but that they had not agreed among themselves exactly what they wanted to build or what kind of partnership they would form to do that. The five are independent, but have formed an organization to lease the space they occupy and handle housekeeping. Collapse of 1985 Plan</p> <p>The exchanges are scheduled to vote next month on how to proceed.</p> <p>In 1985, the exchanges and the city agreed on the construction of a $500 million 56-story office building and adjacent 11-story trading space at the ramp of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. But after the stock market crashed, the Mercantile Exchange withdrew, and the deal fell through.</p> <p>Mr. Guttman said the exchanges would like to build a $175 million to $225 million structure, with a trading floor of 55,000 to 60,000 square feet, unencumbered by columns, and a second area of equal size on a different floor, for future expansion. The exchanges would like to break ground next year and move by 1993, he said.</p> <p>The exchanges&#39; trading floor now is 25,000 square feet.</p> <p>Robert W. McGrath, a spokesman for the Commodity Exchange who is designated to speak for the five exchanges, said the group was having &#39;&#39;discussions with the appropriate entities&#39;&#39; and was analyzing which sites would work financially and functionally.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Before you can get to specifics of who can make the best offer, you have to look generically at what&#39;s there,&#39;&#39; Mr. McGrath said. The exchanges, he added, were considering what was needed for construction and what help was available.</p>
683165>Con Ed to Increase Electricity Rates By 1.1% on May 1 The Consolidated Edison Company of New York will raise its electricity rates on May 1 by $55.1 million, or 1.1 percent, the company said yesterday. The bill of a typical apartment dweller in New York City using 300 kilowatt-hours a month will rise to $51.26 from $50.52, and the bill of a Westchester customer using 450 kilowatt-hours a month will rise to $71.05 from $70.05, the utility said.  <p>The company, which has three million customers, agreed on a formula three years ago with the Public Service Commission for the calculation of increases in 1992, 1993 and 1994. It got increases of 5 percent at this time last year, and 4.5 percent in 1992, meaning that when the new increase takes effect, the deal will have given Con Ed an increase of 10.9 percent over the period. After the increase at the beginning of next month, the formula is up for review.</p> <p>According to the company, even with the increase next month, electricity is cheaper now than 10 years ago, because fuel adjustment charges are lower. The 300 kilowatt-hours that will cost $51.26 next month would have been $52.90 in 1983, when prices hit a peak, according to the company.</p> <p>A spokesman for the company, Bruce H. Wittmer, said three factors contributed to the increase. Under a Federal law to promote efficient use of fuel, the utility is required to buy power from some independent producers, he said, and that is raising the average cost of electricity.</p> <p>In addition, he said, Con Ed is spending money on efficiency, including rebates to customers who buy energy-efficient light bulbs and other equipment. The company is also spending money on improving the equipment it uses to generate and distribute electricity, he said.</p> <p>Con Ed had no rate increases between 1983 and 1992; in fact, it had a 3.1 percent cut in 1987, caused primarily by declining fuel prices. In addition, the company has not had to build any new generating stations in recent years.</p> <p>Correction:  April 23, 1994, Saturday</p> <p>An article yesterday about a 1.1 percent increase in Consolidated Edison&#39;s electricity rates misstated the starting date of the increase. It was April 1, not May 1.</p>
863291>U.S. Approves Huge Western Rail Merger A Federal regulatory agency today approved the merger of the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads, a $5.4 billion deal that will create the nation&#39;s largest railroad and nearly complete the consolidation of the freight rail system west of the Mississippi. Just two companies would carry 90 percent of the freight in this huge area of the country. The agency, the Surface Transportation Board, voted 3 to 0 to approve the deal, effectively a takeover of the financially weakened Southern Pacific by its stronger partner, subject to numerous conditions intended to minimize the loss of competition.  <p>Because the two railroads overlap in Texas and elsewhere, the merger has been fought by many shippers, and it divided the Federal Government. The Agriculture and Transportation Departments and the antitrust division of the Justice Department all opposed it.</p> <p>But last year, when Congress eliminated the Interstate Commerce Commission and created the board to absorb some of its functions, it bypassed the Justice Department and gave merger authority to the new agency, which was born on Jan. 1, 1996, and is known colloquially as the Surf Board.</p> <p>The decision, expected to run about 200 pages, will not be released until Aug. 12, but the board&#39;s presiding officer, Linda J. Morgan, described it as a compromise.</p> <p>&quot;This is not an either-or, a slam dunk, a yes-no,&quot; she said, but an attempt to &quot;address the harm, and at the same time preserve the benefit&quot; of the merger, which the two companies say will come to $620 million a year, mostly by  shortening the routes that freight must follow to get from one city to another.  It will also allow new capital investment of $1.3 billion in the ailing Southern Pacific over the next four years, the companies say.</p> <p>Other railroads and many shippers, including industries and farmers, opposed  the merger, and some are likely to take their case to court. But, Ms. Morgan said, &quot;There are many publics and many interests, and as we have learned this morning, we cannot satisfy each.&quot;</p> <p>It apparently did satisfy Union Pacific&#39;s chairman, Drew Lewis, who said at a news conference: &quot;We are satisfied, I guess I should say well satisfied.&quot; Mr. Lewis&#39;s railroad is based in Omaha; the parent Union Pacific Corporation has its headquarters in Bethlehem, Pa.</p> <p>After the transaction is completed, the new railroad would comprise 37,000 miles of tracks in 25 states, Mexico and Canada.</p> <p>But to preserve competition, the company would have to provide access to about 4,000 miles for the other big Western railroad, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe, based in Fort Worth. Under the conditions approved today, dozens of specified factories, mines and other rail customers that now have a choice between the Southern Pacific and the Union Pacific would have the right to have  a Burlington Northern train come to them over the tracks of the merged company.</p> <p>These &quot;trackage rights&quot; were originally conceived by Union Pacific and negotiated with Burlington Northern before the deal was submitted to the Government; the board said it had expanded on them.</p> <p>In addition, many customers served by the Southern Pacific or the Union Pacific currently have the option to build a spur to the other line, an option that the merger will render moot. They will be given the option of building to other railroads, or access to the Burlington Northern through trackage rights. They will also be allowed to truck their products to the lines of competing railroads.</p> <p>A third category of protection involves storage by a railroad of a shipper&#39;s  product -- a practice common in the plastics industry. The merged line will be required to let Burlington Northern compete for some of that hauling business, and use Union Pacific&#39;s storage space, under the board&#39;s ruling.</p> <p>And the Texas Mexican Railway, a modest-sized regional line controlled by Transportacion Maritima Mexicana S.A. with a 49 percent stake purchased last year by Kansas City Southern Industries, won the right to operate over the new railroad&#39;s tracks from Corpus Christi to Beaumont. There, it can connect with other lines.</p> <p>But many of the merger&#39;s opponents were not mollified by the conditions. The  Coalition for Competitive Rail Transportation, a shippers&#39; group, issued a statement saying, &quot;Today the final score was S.T.B., 3; the public, 0.&quot;</p> <p>The Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department&#39;s antitrust division, Anne K. Bingaman, who had testified against the merger on Monday, said the decision would &quot;create a monopoly in many markets and leave shippers throughout the West with just two major rail competitors.&quot;</p> <p>The Justice Department has projected that the merged line will increase prices by 19 percent for shippers that previously had a choice between the two lines, and 10 percent for those that today have three lines to choose from and will only have two after the merger.</p> <p>Curtis M. Grimm, chairman of the transportation department at the University  of Maryland and a consultant for Kansas City Southern, a competing line, said after the vote: &quot;There are three railroads in the West and two of them are merging; Union Pacific is buying its biggest competitor. I don&#39;t think it was profound to say it was anticompetitive.&quot;</p> <p>Professor Grimm said that the changes made by the board to the trackage agreements submitted by the railroads last year amounted to &quot;tinkering.&quot;</p> <p>The lines&#39; advantage, he said, was that they are &quot;very well connected with Republican leadership, and the Republicans are in charge.&quot; Mr. Lewis of Union Pacific was Secretary of Transportation in the Reagan Administration.</p> <p>But the railroads involved argued that the alternative was for service on the San Francisco-based Southern Pacific to deteriorate and for that railroad to die slowly. Some shippers and other railroads argued that the merged company should  be required to sell some lines to competitors, but Ms. Morgan said this would destroy some of the efficiencies the merger was intended to achieve.</p> <p>Stock investors seemed to approve of the deal, pushing up the prices of railroad shares broadly. Each merger partner recorded a 52-week high, with Union Pacific shares up 62.5 cents, to $72.75, and Southern Pacific gaining $1.50, to close at $28.25, both on the New York Stock Exchange. Burlington Northern Santa Fe rose $1.875, ending at $86.25, also in Big Board trading. Kansas City Southern was up 75 cents, at $18.25.</p> <p>Rail-union leaders also supported the decision. &quot;Normally we oppose mergers,&quot; said James M. Brunkenhoefer, a lobbyist for the United Transportation Union. &quot;We try to deal with the realities of the current time. We recognized that the Southern Pacific could not continue to sell real estate to operate.&quot; The railroad has lost money on operations in 14 of the last 17 years.</p>
463841>Gasoline at Low Price, But Benefits May Fade A year after Saddam Hussein sent tanks into Kuwait and fear and anger into the hearts of American motorists, the price storm is over and the cost of gasoline is at historic lows, when inflation is taken into account. A new study by Cambridge Energy Research Associates concluded that the pretax price at the pump is now the lowest since 1947, after adjusting for inflation. Even with a one-third increase in recent years in Federal and state taxes, which now average 36 cents a gallon, gasoline today is only about 8 cents a gallon higher than it was in 1988.  <p>&quot;The good old days, when it comes to gasoline prices, are now,&quot; said Daniel Yergin, the oil historian and author of the report.  56% Below Peak</p> <p>Adjusting the price at the pump to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index, the average price in the first five months of this year, $1.15, was 6 percent lower than it was in 1972, the year before the Arab oil embargo. The current price is 56 percent of the peak price in 1980, in the panic that followed the Iranian revolution. Stated in today&#39;s dollars, the average price in 1980 was $2.04 a gallon, Mr. Yergin said.</p> <p>During the Kuwait crisis, gasoline prices rose to a peak about 30 percent above the prewar price. Now, despite an increase in Federal and state taxes, prices are within 10 percent of the year-ago level.</p> <p>The low price may surprise the public but not specialists, said David L. Morehead, vice president of the Petroleum Marketers Association, a trade association in Washington.</p> <p>&quot;The oil industry, let&#39;s face it, is an industry that people love to hate,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m sorry to say that people are not going out and hugging gasoline dealers. Everybody notices when prices go up, everyone talks about it and Congress calls hearings. But when they go down, not much is said about it.&quot; &#39;A Dream World&#39;</p> <p>David L. Lewis, a professor of business history at the University of Michigan Business School, called the current price &quot;a dream world,&quot; adding, &quot;You just can&#39;t expect gasoline to stay this cheap indefinitely.&quot;</p> <p>Professor Lewis suggested that while a low price is good news for consumers in the short run, it may set the country and the auto industry on a perilous course. Low prices in the 1970&#39;s led American auto makers to specialize in big cars, and when the gasoline crunch of 1979-80 came along, consumers wanted small, fuel-efficient models and only the Japanese manufacturers had them.</p> <p>&quot;That&#39;s the lesson which does not seem to have been learned,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The low price misleads consumers, too, said Glenn P. Sugameli, a specialist in energy issues at the National Wildlife Federation. &quot;If there was a consistent trend toward higher gasoline prices, the consumer and auto companies would have a clear signal that more efficient cars is where they should be going,&quot; he said. Because price will not provide that signal, a strong auto-mileage bill is more necessary than ever, he said.</p> <p>Congress is now sifting through several proposals on what Detroit should be building as part of a debate over national energy policy. One would force the auto makers to improve the fuel economy of new cars to 40 miles a gallon by the turn of the century.</p> <p>But at today&#39;s low gasoline prices, investments to make cars more efficient pay for themselves slowly if at all, and that means the economics alone do not now encourage spending large sums to save gasoline.</p> <p>Another proposal, sponsored by the Bush Administration, would direct fleet vehicles to use fuels other than gasoline, in part to clean the air. But the cost penalty of this switch would rise as the price of gasoline fell.</p> <p>Mr. Yergin, in a telephone interview, said, &quot;With prices down, it takes a lot of the fuel out of all the energy debates.&quot;</p>
810486>Pilots Weren&#39;t Ready for Type Of Failure Suspected in Crash The pilots of a USAir Boeing 737 could have recovered from the mysterious swing of the rudder that appears responsible for the crash of the airliner near  Pittsburgh 14 months ago if they had increased air speed and ignored the natural inclination to hold their altitude, officials of the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing testified today. But nothing in the pilots&#39; training told them what to do when such a rudder failure occurred, experts told the National Transportation Safety Board.  <p>We don&#39;t train for events that don&#39;t occur,&quot; said Michael Carriker, senior  engineering project pilot for the 737 at Boeing. He was testifying on the second day of reopened hearings into the crash of the plane, Flight 427, near Pittsburgh International Airport that killed all 132 people aboard.</p> <p>Indeed, other experts testified, the 737 was approved by the Federal Government on the presumption that such events would hardly ever occur, perhaps  once in the lifetime of the whole fleet of planes. Boeing still does not acknowledge that such a rudder movement occurred, and the safety board has not reached a conclusion.</p> <p>But investigators have no other explanation for the plane&#39;s spiraling dive to earth. And the safety board strongly suspects the same problem occurred in a 1991 crash of a United Airlines 737 at Colorado Springs, that killed 25 people.  The two incidents represent the biggest unsolved accidents in the safety board&#39;s history.</p> <p>Mr. Carriker and others also testified that tests conducted after the USAir crash greatly expanded their knowledge of the turbulence that an airliner leaves in its wake. The USAir plane that crashed first encountered trouble when it ran  across the wake of a Delta Airlines Boeing 727 that was about 70 seconds ahead and 300 feet above. Mr. Carriker showed a videotape of tests conducted near Atlantic City involving a 727 and a 737. The 727 was equipped with smoke generators on each wingtip that made the turbulence visible; the plane left tight vortices, or corkscrews of wind, floating for miles behind it.</p> <p>In the test, when the trailing plane&#39;s fuselage hit a vortex, it rolled 60 degrees; Mr. Carriker said it rolled at a rate of 36 degrees per second, or about 12 times faster than the autopilot was programmed to roll the plane when banking for turns. The impact of the vortex on the fuselage also produced an unidentified sound similar to one heard on the cockpit voice recorder in the USAir jet as the accident began, he and others said.</p> <p>The connection between the plane hitting the vortex and the rudder swinging to one side is not completely clear. Investigators, frustrated that they have no direct evidence that the incident involving the rudder occurred, say that for now they must assume it was a malfunction. Boeing suggests that in the absence of physical signs from the wreckage that there was something wrong with the rudder control mechanism, perhaps there was no malfunction. The implication is that for some reason the pilot or co-pilot directed the rudder to deflect.</p> <p>Assuming a sudden uncommanded movement of the rudder, the ability of other flight controls to counter that force depends on air speed, according to experts. At high speed, with a strong flow of air over the wings, flaps near the ends of the wings, called ailerons, could counteract a rudder swing. In addition, the fast flow of air would limit how far the rudder could move. But at 190 knots, the speed of the USAir plane, the ailerons have less effect.</p> <p>The testimony pointed to a paradox of airplane design. A big, powerful rudder is needed to assure safety on takeoff; if an engine fails, the pilot would need  a strong rudder to counteract the asymmetrical thrust that would result. But a malfunctioning rudder can evidently be a killer in flight if it swings when it is not commanded to.</p> <p>The safety board is looking intensively at reports of rudder malfunctions in  737&#39;s. Most involve an automatic system, known as the yaw damper, that moves the rudder slightly and very quickly to counteract the plane&#39;s tendency to fishtail. But testimony also focused on whether the F.A.A.&#39;s data base on mechanical problems is comprehensive.</p>
352714>&#39;Gasohol&#39; May Cut Monoxide but Raise Smog, Study Asserts A study prepared for the oil industry and released yesterday has cast doubt on a much-discussed method of fighting air pollution, concluding that requiring grain alcohol in gasoline will produce a minor reduction in carbon monoxide, but a large increase in smog. An amendment to the Clean Air Act approved by the Senate would mandate such a change.  <p>The study was prepared by a California consulting firm that has done extensive work for the governments of eight Northeastern states and California. It concludes that &#39;&#39;gasohol,&#39;&#39; or gasoline with 10 percent grain alcohol, would cut carbon monoxide by 25 percent, but that nitrogen oxides, which cause smog and acid rain, would rise by 8 to 15 percent, and hydrocarbons would rise by 50 percent. That works out to 6 percent more smog.</p> <p>The grain-alcohol lobby immediately attacked the study. Government reaction to ethanol has been mixed. The Environmental Protection Agency says that other provisions of the Senate plan will help reduce pollution, but the two regional agencies that have led policy-making in cleaning up gasoline, the California Air Resources Board and the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, both say they are not sure if alcohol will help.</p> <p>All agree that alcohol would reduce carbon monoxide, which is primarily of concern as a direct poison. In addition, like hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide reacts in sunlight to form smog, or, more formally, ground-level ozone.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association, a group representing alcohol producers, disputed the study because, he said, it used as a basis for tests a specially equipped car and a pure form of gasoline that is not commercially available. The spokesman, Eric Vaughn, said that use of that fuel and car could skew the results.</p> <p>Technical analysts are equivocal when it comes to the benefits of ethanol. &#39;&#39;The jury is still out,&#39;&#39; said Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the California board. &#39;&#39;We do know that there seems to be a reduction in carbon monoxide, but there seems to be some slight increase in nitrogen oxide. We have not determined as of yet which is the greater. We still are not certain whether there&#39;s a benefit or not.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>In Washington, ethanol, which is made from corn, has strong backing from farm-state senators, including Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader.</p> <p>At the E.P.A., Richard D. Wilson, director of the Office of Mobile Sources, said the Senate proposal would improve air quality because it also calls for a 15 percent reduction in ozone, with no increase in nitrogen oxides. One way it would achieve this, Mr. Wilson said, is by cutting another component of gasoline called aromatics, heavy molecules that sometimes fail to burn completely. Another official at the California board, Thomas A. Cackette, said that &#39;&#39;if alcohol is used the way it is used today, the only conclusion you can have is that it hurts air quality.&#39;&#39; But he agreed with Mr. Wilson that the Senate plan would require other changes that would help air quality.</p> <p>&#39;Paying More for Dirtier Air&#39;</p> <p>One of the two authors of the study, Thomas C. Austin, former head of the California board, said in an interview that under the Senate plan &#39;&#39;motorists will end up paying more for dirtier air.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Gasoline with alcohol additives is already in common use in some parts of the country, as gasohol or &#39;&#39;oxygenated&#39;&#39; fuel. The ethanol portion of the fuel is about twice as expensive as the same amount of gasoline and delivers one-third less mileage per gallon. To stimulate sales, ethanol has been exempted from taxes, at a cost to the Federal Treasury since 1980 of $3.1 billion, and to state treasuries of $1.6 billion over the same period.</p> <p>Three-quarters of the ethanol is produced by a single company, the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company of Decatur, Ill., an agricultural processor. The company referred all inquiries to the Renewable Fuels Association.</p> <p>The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry&#39;s main trade association, said it did not fear competition from such fuels, because the corn from which the alcohol is made requires more oil and natural gas to produce than it displaces. For example, raising corn requires natural gas for the production of nitrogen fertilizer and diesel oil to run tractors.</p> <p>Higher Costs and Lower Sales</p> <p>However, requiring oxygenated fuels would raise costs and could depress sales, according to the oil industry, all for a net environmental loss. Refiners also fear that they would have to invest new capital to supply oxygenated fuels.</p> <p>Ethanol consumption last year, 840 million gallons, was a tiny fraction of gasoline consumption, which was more than 100 billion gallons.</p> <p>In early April the Senate approved an amendment by Thomas Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, that would require the use of fuel with a high oxygen content in nine cities with air problems. Those cities account for one-fourth of the gasoline market. Other cities could choose the same fuel in preference to other steps to control air pollution. The first nine are Los Angeles, Houston, New York, San Diego, Chicago, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Baltimore and the Hartford-New Haven area.</p> <p>Refiners say the amendment, combined with tax exemptions, heavily favors ethanol. Mr. Vaughn said the requirement might also be met by selling ethanol to refineries, which would turn it into an additive, ETBE, or with other oxygenated fuels, including MTBE and methanol.</p> <p>Parallel Amendment in House</p> <p>When the House takes up the Clean Air Act, it will consider a parallel amendment offered by Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico, that covers 27 cities.</p> <p>Car engines produce carbon monoxide, which has one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, when they burn gasoline without enough oxygen present to make carbon dioxide, a molecule with two oxygen atoms. Putting alcohol in gasoline helps prevent the creation of carbon monoxide because the alcohol molecule incorporates an oxygen atom, along with two carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms.</p> <p>Engineers say that if the fuel is 10 percent grain alcohol, the engine can burn it thoroughly with 4.1 percent less air than is required for a straight gasoline burn.</p> <p>But putting more oxygen into the cylinder raises the combustion temperature, which increases the creation of nitrogen oxides, which are formed with nitrogen pulled from the air. It also increases the tendency of gasoline to evaporate, a phenomenon that releases unburned hydrocarbons, another ingredient of smog, into the air.</p> <p>Several years ago California ordered gas reformulated to cut these evaporative emissions, and last year New York, New Jersey and the six New England states followed suit. Oil companies initially protested those steps bitterly, because it required them to remove some cheap, abundant components of gasoline, but more recently, several have voluntarily taken the same step in other parts of the country, as their contribution to cleaner air. The evaporations come from under the hood and from refueling.</p> <p>The Daschle amendment would partly exempt the oil companies that used ethanol from the anti-evaporation limits on gasoline.</p>
374595>PRICE OF OIL RISES; STOCKS IN RETREAT Oil prices rose again yesterday and the stock market fell sharply in unusually volatile trading as investors feared that higher energy prices brought on by the turmoil in the Middle East could push an already weak American economy into recession.  <p>After plunging more than 120 points in the biggest selloff since last October&#39;s ominous drop, the Dow Jones industrial average recovered rapidly and ended the day down 54.95 points, at 2,809.65.</p> <p>In the oil markets, West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, closed on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $24.49 a barrel, up $1.38 from the day before and $8.55 since mid-June.</p> <p>Bond Prices Fall</p> <p>In the credit markets, the price of the Treasury&#39;s 30-year bonds fell and interest rates rose on expectation of renewed inflation, while the dollar and gold rose slightly.</p> <p>Energy prices have already begun rising for consumers. Around the country, some service stations anticipated higher gasoline prices by raising the pump price; the Michigan chapter of the American Automobile Association, for example, surveyed 100 stations in the Detroit area and found that 30 had raised the price by at least a nickel after closing on Thursday. Northwest Airlines said it would begin charging an $8 fuel surcharge on all domestic tickets as of Aug. 9.</p> <p>Though the outlook for oil prices and inflation is as uncertain as the developing events in the Middle East, some analysts said the current fears of an inflationary impact seemed exaggerated.</p> <p>View Called Incorrect</p> <p>Speaking of the Dow&#39;s dance, Charles T. Maxwell, the vice chairman of C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell and an energy analyst, said, &#39;&#39;A climactic series of events has convinced people, I think quite incorrectly, of a devastating effect of inflation&#39;&#39; brought on by higher oil prices.</p> <p>Mr. Maxwell said the market would not support higher oil prices for long, even if Iraq seeks them, unless other factors, like natural disaster, or blockade and embargo, intervene.</p> <p>Daniel Yergin, of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, predicted that when the dust settled, the Iraqis would want to sell oil. &#39;&#39;These are one-crop economies,&#39;&#39; he said of the Persian Gulf nations.</p> <p>Other energy experts and economists, taking a longer view, said yesterday that even if President Saddam Hussein of Iraq achieved his goal of raising the price of OPEC oil to $25 a barrel, an increase of about 50 percent from the levels that prevailed before the Kuwait crisis, the effect on this country&#39;s pattern of energy use would be modest.</p> <p>Still, the effects would ripple through the economy.</p> <p>Effect on Prices</p> <p>&#39;&#39;This is probably going to push up the Consumer Price Index by a percent or more,&#39;&#39; said George F. Friesen, an energy expert at Deutsche Bank Group. Higher energy prices mean more reluctance in Washington to raise energy taxes, and therefore a harder job in balancing the budget, he said. &#39;&#39;Increasing the Federal excise tax on gasoline is probably a nonstarter for this year,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>All the talk of price increases is coming long before a shortage could develop; the Persian Gulf is about six weeks from North America by tanker. In addition, it is not clear if the Iraqi invasion will result in a substantial supply interruption, or a price increase will be any higher than the $21 a barrel that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced it would seek last month.</p> <p>An increase to $25, which would imply a price of $27 for West Texas Intermediate, which sells for more because it need not be transported so far, would stimulate domestic drilling and probably slow the decline in American oil production, but not stop it, experts said. Production is declining 4 to 5 percent a year.</p> <p>The higher price would induce oil companies to spend more on exploration and production, but mostly abroad, industry experts said. In this country, companies would quickly turn to more costly &#39;&#39;tertiary recovery&#39;&#39; methods to squeeze more oil out of old fields that cannot be effectively operated at low prices. And the increase would rekindle a stalled trend toward greater energy efficiency and probably encourage energy research, experts say.</p> <p>Research May Be Resumed</p> <p>&#39;&#39;In the last 10 years, the main activity of people working in alternative energy in laboratories has been sending out their resumes,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Yergin, of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. OPEC oil at $25 a barrel would &#39;&#39;get them back to their research,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The total change in the energy bill from $25-a-barrel OPEC oil is difficult to figure, because higher prices would induce some conservation and would also lead to lower economic growth, which would also cut consumption. An oil price increase would also pull up the price of natural gas, experts say.</p> <p>But an increase of about $10 a barrel would come to about $60 billion a year; the nation&#39;s energy bill last year for all sources was about $450 billion. The gross national product, or value of all goods and services, was about $5 trillion.</p> <p>Higher Gasoline Prices</p> <p>The biggest impact of higher oil prices would be higher gasoline prices, since about two-thirds of oil is used in transportation. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in Oak Ridge, Tenn., David L. Greene, a transportation researcher, said, however, that an increase to $25 would not have a large effect on motorists.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;Real fuel prices are as low now as ever,&#39;&#39; he said, pointing out that when inflation is taken into account, gasoline at $1.15 is cheaper than it was before the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74. And the per-mile cost of driving a car has never been lower, he said, because new cars go twice as far on a gallon as cars of the 1960&#39;s and early 1970&#39;s did. On average, the fleet is 50 percent more efficient.</p> <p>Before the invasion, West Texas Intermediate was trading from $16 to $21, Dr. Greene pointed out, and an increase to $27 from the top of that range would add only 15 or 20 cents a gallon to gasoline. That is a consumer expenditure of $15 billion to $20 billion a year, which would have a significant effect on the general economy, but would probably make only a modest difference in the market for cars.</p> <p>THE IRAQI INVASION</p>
818224>Maine Nuclear Plant Is Told to Cut Power Acting on an anonymous tip, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has ordered the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant to reduce its power level because it is not clear whether the plant can withstand even a small water leak in its cooling system without a meltdown. The tip came in a three-page letter from someone with detailed knowledge of the 23-year-old reactor four miles south of Wiscasset on the Maine coast. The letter said that plant managers considered the commission &quot;a nuisance&quot; and, in 1989, manipulated data and a computer program in an application to increase the  power level of the plant.  <p>After reviewing the computer program, the commission on Monday ordered Maine Yankee to find another way to demonstrate that the power level was safe, or to operate at the lower power level.</p> <p>The letter said that the writer worked for Yankee Atomic Electric Company, a  firm owned by some of the 10 utilities that share ownership of Maine Yankee and  has done engineering work for the plant since it was built. Maine Yankee is owned by a group of utilities and holding companies in New England. Central Maine Power of Augusta owns 38 percent; New England Electric System of Westboro, Mass., 20 percent; Northeast Utilities of Berlin, Conn., 20 percent, and Bangor  Hydro-Electric Company, 7 percent. Smaller companies hold 15 percent.</p> <p>The commission is now planning two separate investigations: whether the plant can safely generate 910 megawatts of electricity, as it has been allowed to do since September 1990, and whether the company told the truth when it applied to do so.</p> <p>The reactor has been shut since January 1995 for $30 million in repairs to its steam generators, which are not involved in the allegations. It is supposed  to reopen this month.</p> <p>The plant began operating in 1972 and has not suffered the kind of accident that the emergency cooling system is meant to cope with.</p> <p>&quot;They&#39;re going to have to document and justify&quot; that they can run the plant at the higher power level, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, John Kopeck, said today. The plant will have to submit an analysis that it can operate safely at the original power level, 825 megawatts, before it can restart, Mr. Kopeck said, but after that submission it can resume operation without waiting for commission approval.</p> <p>The letter also said that an analysis of the containment dome over the reactor, meant to show that the plant could run at the higher power level, was &quot;fraudulent.&quot;</p> <p>Marshall D. Murphy, director of public affairs for Maine Yankee, said that the reactor managers were &quot;satisfied that the technical justification is indeed  accurate.</p> <p>The letter was sent about three weeks ago to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group, which forwarded it to state officials in Maine. Those officials sent it on to the regulatory commission.</p>
287170>Report Finds Energy Department Liable for Nuclear Plant Penalties An Energy Department report on contracts with the companies that run its troubled bomb plants shows that the Government is liable for criminal fines levied against the companies by state or other Federal agencies.  <p>The Government also must often pay expenses that are obviously fraudulent, and it cannot require that incompetent, careless or insubordinate workers be fired.</p> <p>In addition, the report said, while a Federal law gives the department the authority to fine contractors that violate its safety rules, the contracts allow the companies to bill the Government for its own fine.</p> <p>The report, by the department&#39;s Inspector General&#39;s office, said, that if the Government did not reimburse the companies for such fines, the fine could not be collected because in many cases the corporations that run the plants have shielded themselves by establishing subsidiaries with no assets. Billions of Dollars</p> <p>Virtually all the work in the Government&#39;s bomb program is done by contractor employees, including those of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the Rockwell International Corporation.</p> <p>The issue of liability is important because the plants have billions of dollars of environmental problems, and some continue to violate environmental laws. In addition, the department has said it wants to spend tens of billions of dollars in coming years to rebuild the bomb plants, but critics have questioned the department&#39;s ability to manage large-scale projects.</p> <p>The report, issued on Sept. 15, was requested by Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. He said the contracts &#39;&#39;leave the Government and the taxpayer vulnerable to fraud and abuse.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Energy Secretary James D. Watkins and his predecessor, Joseph Herrington, have questioned their department&#39;s ability to oversee the companies that run the bomb plants. Mr. Watkins, in a letter to Inspector General John C. Layton on Friday, praised the report and said it would be evaluated by the department&#39;s general counsel and Assistant Secretary for Management Administration. Mr. Watkins said he had taken steps to strengthen supervision of contractors. Stronger Contracts Seen</p> <p>W. Henson Moore, Deputy Secretary of Energy, said in a telephone interview yesterday that he and Mr. Watkins would insist on stronger contracts when they come up for renewal. The first will probably be a contract to replace Rockwell at the Rocky Flats plant near Denver with EG&amp;G Inc., an engineering company that runs the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.</p> <p>Last Friday the department announced that it and Rockwell had agreed to terminate the Rocky Flats contract early, the first time such a thing had been done. A key issue was Rockwell&#39;s request for assurance that it was protected from criminal prosecution for violations of waste-handling laws. Mr. Moore said yesterday that the department wanted the plant manager replaced or assisted by other managers with more experience in nuclear matters, and wanted generally more experienced management.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;There was no meeting of the minds on what we thought was necessary to run that place and what they thought was necessary,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The contract at Rocky Flats was among the 52 &#39;&#39;management and operating&#39;&#39; contracts studied by the Inspector General. The 52 account for $11 billion of the department&#39;s $17 billion budget.</p> <p>Many of the contracts do not even require that the expenses submitted to the Government for payment be reasonable, the report said. And while contractors can be held liable for willful misconduct or lack of good faith by management employees, that affects only a handful of people, sometimes only a single person at a plant where thousands work, it said. In addition, the report said there is no standard definition of willful misconduct.</p> <p>From the beginnings of the nuclear bomb program, the Government has indemnified the companies against risks. The logic, affirmed by Congress in 1988 when it renewed the Price-Anderson Act limiting contractor liability, is that companies would not take on the work for the small potential profits if there was a risk of substantial losses.</p>
598933>Northeast Making Progress in Meeting Auto Emission Goals The Northeast appears to be well on its way to adopting California&#39;s tailpipe pollution standards, the strictest in the nation, which will mean substantial changes to all new cars and trucks and the widespread sale of electric vehicles. Although cobiGeneral Motors is engaged in a state-by-state struggle to block the standards, advocates say they gained a crucial victory this month with New Jersey&#39;s adoption of the program.  <p>Under the New Jersey law, the state will adopt the stricter standards by the 1996 model year if the four neighboring states do the same, or by the 1998 model year if states with 40 percent of the Northeast&#39;s car market join the program, a threshold that is very near. New York, Massachusetts and Maine have passed laws to adopt the program, although the auto industry has won a first-round court decision to block adoption in New York.</p> <p>The California standards require manufacturers to sell cars and light trucks with sharply lower emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, which are ingredients of smog, and of carbon monoxide.  Catalytic Converters</p> <p>Some cars will achieve the standards by using natural gas or methanol. But cars that run on gasoline will require new catalytic converters; some will probably be equipped with batteries that will jolt them with enough electricity to heat them to operating temperature before the engine starts. Some manufacturers have already modified small cars to meet the standards by moving the catalytic converters forward, snug against the engine, to warm up faster.</p> <p>The standards also require &quot;zero-emission vehicles,&quot; presumably cars that run on electricity. In 1998, 2 percent of cars must be zero-emission models, rising in steps to 10 percent in the next few years.</p> <p>The car makers say the new gasoline-powered cars will cost at least $1,000 extra, although California believes the costs will be far lower. The car companies say the higher prices will make the new cars harder to sell, and they are also particularly reluctant to be forced to sell electric cars.</p> <p>But Scott Weiner, New Jersey&#39;s Commissioner of Environment and Energy, said that as more states adopt the standards, it becomes more likely that manufacturers will cooperate. &quot;We&#39;re getting closer to reaching critical mass in the marketplace,&quot; he said  Tailpipe Standards</p> <p>The 1990 Clean Air Act gave California, with the worst air pollution in the nation, the right to set its own tailpipe standards. It also allowed other states to adopt the California program over the Federal one.</p> <p>Outside California, the states have concluded that in practice they could choose the California rules over the Federal rules only if they acted in concert. Otherwise, they feared, the auto makers would offer only a few models for sale in those states and at very high prices.</p> <p>To address this problem, New Jersey lawmakers decided that the state would adopt the program only if states representing 40 percent of the auto market in the area from Virginia to Maine did so.</p> <p>Mr. Weiner said the 40 percent threshold could be crossed with one more heavily populated state. &quot;My sense is Maryland is well on its way to legislative approval,&quot; he said, and that would make 40 percent.  Industry Not Giving Up</p> <p>But the auto industry, led by General Motors is not giving up.</p> <p>It filed suit in Maine earlier this month to overturn that state&#39;s adoption. In a similar suit in New York, a Federal District Court judge in Syracuse threw out New York&#39;s adoption of the program last month. One reason is that New York did not adopt the California gasoline standard, and the car makers argued that the catalytic converters that are welded into California cars and are supposed to last 100,000 miles would not last that long without the type of gasoline to be used in California.</p> <p>As a result, they said, they would have to build cars for sale in New York with converters that were easily removable, and that would consitute something different from a car meeting the California standards or a car meeting Federal standards. The Clean Air Act prohibits states from requiring a &quot;third car.&quot;</p> <p>New York State was in court last week asking for a rehearing and a stay of the decision.</p> <p>The state-by-state battle grows out of an agreement a year and a half ago by representatives of the six New England states, plus New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and the District of Columbia, that each would adopt the program. Since then, Virginia has backed away and Connecticut has taken a wait-and-see attitude. &#39;Somewhat Spotty&#39;</p> <p>An expert who has studied the program, James H. Wilson, said that with New Jersey&#39;s adoption, a core of states was assembling. &quot;It is likely to work out O.K., even if it is somewhat spotty,&quot; said Mr. Wilson, a scientist at E. H. Pechan &amp; Associates, a consulting firm based in Springfield, Va., that was hired by an association of mid-Atlantic states to study the effect the California standards would have in the region.</p> <p>A spokesman for General Motors, William Winters, said the auto manufacturers had not yet decided whether to challenge the New Jersey law. If the manufacturers succeed in keeping the program out of New York, he said, the 40 percent threshold might never be reached.</p> <p>New York and other states are counting on the California car program as a major component of their effort to comply with the Federal Clean Air Act.</p> <p>The act applies different deadlines in different cities, depending on the level of air pollution, but gives New York until 2007 to come into compliance, with a requirement to meet various standards along the way. So far, the state has missed its first deadline, and it faces the threat of losing Federal transportation funds in about a year.</p>
149723>Utility Sets Plan to Cut Power Use New England&#39;s largest electric company today filed with the State of Connecticut a conservation plan intended to cut in half the growth in demand for electricity.  <p>The program was hailed by regulators and environmentalists, who had collaborated in its development, as the most ambitious of its kind in the nation.</p> <p>The plan calls for Northeast Utilities to spend almost $20 million in the next year and substantially more in future years to help pay for energy-saving methods in the homes, offices and factories of customers. The company will recoup the costs through higher rates, just as it recoups investments in new plants. If the conservation increases Northeast&#39;s spare capacity, it can sell the extra power to neighboring utilities at a profit. Possible Benefit for Consumers</p> <p>The plan offers the potential for lower electric rates than might have been required had higher demand necessitated the construction of more generating plants.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;This is by far the most comprehensive efficiency program anywhere in the country,&#39;&#39; said Douglas I. Foy, the executive director of the Conservation Law Foundation of New England, a major environmental group based in Boston that helped write the plan. The other parties were Northeast Utilities, the staff of the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control, the state-appointed consumer advocate and the state&#39;s energy office.</p> <p>The program provides or expands free energy audits for houses, apartments and factories; free installation of weatherstripping; subsidies for insulation, and distribution of free high-efficiency light bulbs. Northeast would help owners of older commercial buildings by paying for engineering studies for energy modifications, evaluating bids for energy improvements, and identifying financing options.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We&#39;ll hold their hands,&#39;&#39; said Earl F. Taylor Jr., Northeast Utilities&#39; director of conservation programs. Incentives for Developers</p> <p>The program would also provide design assistance to the developers of office buildings and other commercial buildings and pay the extra costs of high-efficiency equipment.</p> <p>The program covers the Connecticut Light and Power Company, a Northeast subsidiary with one million customers, serving an area with a population of 2.4 million. It must still be approved by the Department of Public Utility Control, which ordered its preparation.</p> <p>The plan was announced as New England approaches a period of high energy use, with summer brownouts possible. At the same time, utilities are finding it harder to build power plants because of political opposition and financing problems.</p> <p>Parts of the program are scheduled to start in September; others represent improvements in efforts that began several years ago. Programs in California</p> <p>Such conservation measures are already in place in California. Two utilities with many more customers than Northeast, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the Southern California Edison Company, are spending more over all than is contemplated by Northeast Utilities, but are spending less per customer. Daniel A. Kirshner, an economic analyst with the Environmental Defense Fund in San Francisco, said the Connecticut program &#39;&#39;does sound like the most intense.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Utilities and conservationists have argued for years about the effectiveness of conservation incentives. The utilities have contended that not enough homes, factories and businesses will participate and that power plant construction is still needed. Northeast Utilities is not planning any new plant construction, and the two sides have agreed to see how many customers sign up.</p> <p>Most of the program&#39;s elements will cost 2 to 3 cents for each kilowatt-hour saved, which is far less than the cost of producing that much power with a new plant. The chairman of Northeast Utilities, William B. Ellis, said that the &#39;&#39;avoided cost&#39;&#39; is about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. Assistance for Developers</p> <p>Speaking at a news conference in Hartford, Mr. Ellis said design changes and choice of extra-efficent equipment for a new building of 60,000 feet or more could save 15 million kilowatt-hours over the equipment&#39;s life, or enough electricity to power 2,500 homes for a year. The program to assist developers calls for $1.5 million to improve the efficiency of new commercial buildings, for a saving of 48.5 million kilowatt-hours over the lifetime of the equipment. That comes to about 3 cents spent for each kilowatt-hour saved.</p> <p>Central Connecticut is in the midst of a commercial construction boom, and Mr. Foy of the Conservation Law Center referred to some new office buildings as &#39;&#39;gas guzzlers.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;But unlike automotive gas guzzlers, these things last for 50, 100 or 200 years,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;They doom you.&#39;&#39; The Added Cost of Efficiency</p> <p>For a 100,000-square-foot office building, the extra cost of efficiency might come to $40,000, perhaps 2 percent of the construction cost, according to Northeast, which would pick up the tab. &#39;&#39;There are almost some free lunches available,&#39;&#39; Mr. Ellis said.</p> <p>The added investment could cut annual energy expenses by 30 or 40 percent for such buildings, Mr. Foy said. But builders rarely spend the money, because they do not think they will recover it when they sell the building, he and others said.</p> <p>John P. Cagnetta, Northeast Utilities&#39; senior vice president for corporate planning, said that the company&#39;s peak load was now about 4,600 megawatts and was projected to reach 5,500 by the mid-1990&#39;s, but that the conservation program could eliminate half the growth.</p>
380781>U.N&#39;S DIPLOMACY WELCOMED;   A Little Oil Means a Lot The price of crude oil jumped more than 70 percent since the beginning of July, the financial markets have plunged, and the economic future of the industrial world has been thrown into question, all because of an interruption in supplies that may turn out to be quite modest. A host who bought two cases of beer for a party and broke one bottle would face about the same degree of shortage.  <p>Why, then, is the party turning into a riot?</p> <p>Because, economists and industry executives say, both supply and demand are very slow to respond to changes in oil prices. Neither producers nor consumers of oil are prompted to make changes that would restore an equilibrium. When prices rise sharply for commodities like wheat or pork bellies, farmers quickly adjust their plans to plant fields or slaughter animals, and consumers quickly switch to other products. But in the short term, the same forces do not seem to apply in the oil market.</p> <p>From $18 a Barrel to About $31</p> <p>Hence, the loss of about 4.5 million barrels a day from the world&#39;s supply of roughly 61 million barrels a day has sent the market spinning, even though three members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are expected to make up about three million barrels a day of the lost supply. As a result, a buyer in July who wanted a contract for delivery of oil in August paid less than $18 a barrel. Today, a buyer who wants delivery in October would pay about $31. Many analysts predict that the price will soon rise further.</p> <p>The price of crude oil can also fall sharply.</p> <p>When the price turns lower, as it did in 1986, it is hardly an inducement for producers to pump less from fields that cost millions or billions of dollars to develop. Even if the price falls so low that the company no longer earns a competitive return on its capital investment, some return is better than none. If all the hardware is in place, production will continue as long as the selling price exceeds the cost of pumping an additional barrel.</p> <p>Overproduction Strategy</p> <p>And in the Middle East, where production costs are low, some countries have tried to maintain their income in times of declining prices by raising production. Such a strategy knocks prices even lower.</p> <p>An oil company could stop producing for a month to wait for higher prices. If it did so, say, for a well with a 10-year life, it would be postponing the recovery of the last barrel until the beginning of the 11th year. But commercial producers figure that a dollar in hand can be invested and is therefore worth more than a dollar earned from sales in the 11th year.</p> <p>And when oil prices turn up, it takes months or years to convince companies that the change will last long enough to pay off new investments in multimillion-dollar holes in the ground.</p> <p>Consumers of oil, on the other hand, hardly cut their consumption at all when the price rises, at least in the short term. Longer-term consumption can be affected through decisions like what car a family will buy next or what industrial equipment a company will order. Similarly, consumers do not use much more oil when the price declines.</p> <p>A Market That Lost Its Balance</p> <p>The oil market was more or less in balance until Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the importing nations replied with an embargo. The amount cut off was about 4.5 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have promised to increase production by 2.5 million barrels between them, although they have not yet raised their output by much, and some traders are worried by the delay. The United Arab Emirates is expected to pump another 500,000 barrels a day.</p> <p>By that reckoning, by the fourth quarter of this year, the shortfall will be about 2.5 percent. But that is enough. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s a tiny spread between shortage and glut in our business, between 2 and 3 percent, that&#39;s all,&#39;&#39; said George Babikian, the president of the ARCO Products Company.</p> <p>A listing of supply disruptions over the last three decades by the Energy Department found that the quadrupling of oil prices during the Arab oil embargo after the Yom Kippur War in 1973 was induced by a loss of 2.7 percent of world production.</p> <p>Effect of Buying Extra Oil</p> <p>Philip K. Verleger Jr., an oil and commodities expert and visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics, said he believed that whatever the physical interruption, the effect on the market would be doubled because everyone would seek extra oil to insulate against shortage, the industrial equivalent of all motorists trying to fill the gasoline tanks of their cars. Thus, if the amount of lost supplies was about 2 percent of consumption, he said, demand would rise by 2 percent and the shortfall would be 4 percent. (Thus far, motorists do not appear to be keeping tanks much fuller. With more than 120 million cars on the road, if everyone tried to &#39;&#39;top off&#39;&#39; their tanks by buying an average of five gallons extra, the transfer from storage tanks to vehicle tanks would be about 14 million barrels, or roughly double one day&#39;s consumption. The nation&#39;s 50 million trucks would also demand gasoline and diesel fuel.) Mr. Verleger also noted that commodities are generally volatile; the price of coffee rose sevenfold during the last decade, for example, then fell back. The difference is that few industries run on coffee.</p> <p>World Oil Supplies High</p> <p>Early in the current crisis, there appeared to be mitigating factors for oil. Analysts pointed out, for example, that world supplies were very high. Commercial stocks were about 150 million barrels above their level of the previous year, which would imply perhaps three months of grace before stocks dipped to sub-normal levels. In addition, the United States holds 600 million barrels in a strategic reserve, or enough to make up the shortfall of 1.5 million barrels a day for 400 days; other countries also have strategic stocks.</p> <p>But the stocks, commercial and strategic, are not turning out to be useful, at least not so far.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We don&#39;t know how to use them,&#39;&#39; said Dr. Ethan Kapstein, the director of Harvard University&#39;s Economics and National Security Program.</p> <p>For companies that hold extra supplies, he said, the question is, &#39;&#39;Do you sell them and seek profits now, or do you wait for prices to go up later?&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Self-Fulfilling Expectations</p> <p>The answer, as demonstrated by the marketplace, appears to be that most managers expect prices to go higher and are therefore still buying oil rather than using existing stocks. If this expectation is held widely enough, it is self-fulfilling, because it keeps the demand strong and the price up.</p> <p>As the Bush Administration sees it, the strategic reserve should be saved to deal with physical shortages. Many analysts doubt that such shortages can occur in an unregulated market; oil will always be available, they say, but the price may be very high. In effect, the Administration is saying, however, that the rainy day is not here yet and that the reserve, on which the country has spent about $20 billion, not counting interest, may be more useful later. This approach denies the nation the use of the reserve to stabilize the economy, Dr. Kapstein said.</p> <p>In a way, the New York Mercantile Exchange is agreeing with the Administration that oil will be more expensive later, as the price is bid higher nearly every day.</p> <p>Traders&#39; Worries</p> <p>Some traders doubt that the Saudis and Venezuelans will come through with much in the way of additional supplies. Another worry is that war may spread to Saudi Arabia and that its huge output may be lost. A joke among traders last week was that the weather forecast for the Middle East was 10,000 degrees and cloudy.</p> <p>Some traders look ahead to the fall quarter, when Europe, Japan and the United States build stocks for the winter and when natural gas, a handy substitute in many settings, will be unavailable because of heating demands.</p> <p>The markets&#39; assessment of the chance of war is a matter of instinct and guesswork. But two structural elements of the oil market virtually assure high prices and high demand regardless of military action. One is that under the auction system represented by the open market, the price paid by the last buyer sets the price for the next buyer, and if the last buyer is desperate, the price will be high.</p> <p>The other is that everyone at this party is thirsty.</p> <p>No Alternative to Paying More</p> <p>&#39;&#39;You have capital investments that require oil, the most basic of which is the automobile,&#39;&#39; said Robert Boslego, an oil consultant in Winchester, Mass. &#39;&#39;For the person driving the car, what else is he going to put in the tank? You have no alternative. And he&#39;s not going to stay home from work because it&#39;s going to cost him an extra dollar to get there.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Mr. Boslego and Dr. Kapstein pointed out in separate interviews that thus far, the thrust of Administration policy has been to try to talk the price of gasoline down, muting the signal to consumers to conserve that would be sent by sharply higher prices. Such conservation would limit the price, they say, by establishing a new market balance at a lower level of supply.</p> <p>For now, though, people are buying to meet needs as they have done in previous years. Peter C. Beutel, an oil trader at Merrill Lynch Futures, described the shuffle for oil supplies as a game of musical chairs. &#39;&#39;No one wants to be the odd man out,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>SANCTIONS STARTING TO PINCH IRAQ ECONOMY, U.S. AIDES SAY</p>
1782514>Just Like Others Considering a Presidential Bid, Pataki Unveils a National Energy Plan Gov. George E. Pataki, stopping here Monday between trips to New Hampshire and Iowa, laid out an energy plan that called for cutting American consumption of oil by one-fourth of current levels over the next 10 years. Emphasizing policies that set him apart from many of his fellow Republicans, Mr. Pataki proposed incentives for companies to produce alternatives to gasoline and diesel, to market the substitute fuels, and to build cars capable of burning them. In a half-hour speech, he called for a national campaign to reduce dependence on foreign oil, an effort that he compared to World War II and the American Revolution.  <p>&#39;&#39;One of America&#39;s defining characteristics, as a people and as a nation, is our knack for accepting and overcoming great challenges,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The challenge now, he said, is that much of the imported oil comes from hostile regimes. He cited Iran and said that each time the price went up $5 a barrel, that provided &#39;&#39;$85 million more a day, that they can use to advance their nuclear program or buy more Katyusha rockets for Hezbollah.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>(In fact, Mr. Pataki&#39;s office later acknowledged that the number is closer to $85 million a week.)</p> <p>Mr. Pataki has not publicly discussed any presidential ambitions, and said he was looking forward to a trip to Iowa in the near future to help campaign for Republicans there. But proposing an energy policy is becoming as much a rite of a presidential candidacy as stumping in Iowa, which traditionally holds the first caucus to choose delegates to the national nominating conventions, and his call for relying on corn-based fuels like ethanol is likely to resonate in that state.</p> <p>Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who also has not said if she wants to run in 2008, made an energy speech in May in the same place, the National Press Club. She called for cutting imports in half by 2025.</p> <p>Mr. Pataki proposed relying more on ethanol from corn, which is already in the marketplace, and ethanol from cellulose, which is not, and biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil. He said the government should not pick the technology, but only offer companies financial incentives to work on the problem. For example, he said, companies constructing plants that make fuel from vegetable matter should be able to expense their capital investments.</p> <p>He said governments should lead the way, as New York has done, by cutting their consumption, especially of petroleum. And he noted that last week he signed a bill that prohibits oil companies from preventing gas stations they supply from selling alternative fuels.</p> <p>New cars could be built with the ability to burn gasoline or ethanol at a cost that was &#39;&#39;about the same price they would pay to buy floor mats,&#39;&#39; he said. Building such cars and running them on biofuels whenever possible would wean the country from &#39;&#39;the petroleum that is enriching our enemies and polluting our air,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>The nation is spending $1 billion a day on oil imports, money that should be spent domestically, he said. &#39;&#39;How much longer must we, the world&#39;s greatest nation, be made to hold our breath whenever oil ministers meet in some exotic foreign locale?&#39;&#39; he asked.</p> <p>Asked why President Bush had not set up so ambitious a policy, Mr. Pataki said that the Bush administration had made major progress. In fact, Mr. Pataki&#39;s plan shares many elements with a variety of proposals made by elected officials since gasoline hit $3 a gallon.</p> <p>On a particularly contentious oil issue, whether drilling should be allowed in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, he said that drilling in American territory should be expanded but that he could not rule anything in or out. He also said he did not favor increasing the federal gasoline tax, a step that economists say would encourage people to use less gasoline.</p> <p>Mr. Pataki said he was studying whether carbon dioxide, a global warming gas emitted by power plants, could be captured and permanently stored underground, perhaps in old oil fields where it would force more oil to the surface. He added that New York, with his support, was one of seven Northeastern states that signed an agreement last December that seeks to limit carbon dioxide output from power plants.</p>
582991>Nuclear Programs In a Meltdown NUCLEAR power has grabbed headlines lately because of the premature retirement of several reactors, but something else in the industry is quietly withering away: its educational infrastructure. Nationwide, only about 1,000 college juniors and seniors are enrolled in nuclear engineering degree programs, down from a peak of about 2,100 in the late 1970&#39;s, according to Energy Department surveys. Enrollment in master&#39;s programs stands at about 800, down from 1,400 in the mid-70&#39;s.  <p>At first glance the department&#39;s surveys suggest that doctoral students are bucking the trend: their numbers have risen slightly since the mid-70&#39;s, to about 700. But half the students are from abroad. And while foreigners constitute a large proportion of most doctoral engineering programs in the United States, foreign graduates in other fields tend to stay here, university professors report; in the nuclear field they go home, because their countries are building more plants than this country is.  Undergraduates Drop</p> <p>Still, at least the doctoral programs can survive on foreign students until a time when more American students might apply. Energy Department figures show the number of undergraduate programs dropping from 80 in 1975 to 53 in the last academic year.</p> <p>More precipitous is the decline in the number of research reactors, the tools near the heart of the graduate programs. About 27 survive, down from 76 in the mid-70&#39;s. Some succumbed to student losses; others to increasing maintenance and security costs.</p> <p>The demise of nuclear engineering programs mimics the industry&#39;s slump. Until the mid-1970&#39;s, experts were predicting that there would be 1,000 power-generating reactors in this country by the turn of the century, and by 1978 utilities nationwide had placed orders for 250 reactors. But half those orders were canceled, and the reactor population now stands at 111 and falling.</p> <p>Most were done in by unfavorable economics; compared with other sources of electricity, reactors were too expensive to build and operate. The 1979 accident at Three Mile Island did not improve the industry&#39;s image. But professors say that students do not mention this.</p> <p>It&#39;s all bad news for engineering schools, said Kenneth C. Rogers, who was president of the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., until President Reagan appointed him to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission five years ago. &quot;The problem is that it hasn&#39;t been perceived as an expanding, exciting field to go into,&quot; Mr. Rogers said.</p> <p>The drop in the number of nuclear engineering students would not be an issue if it paralleled the job market. But nuclear engineers, along with other specialists like radiation protection technicians, are likely to be in high demand as the Federal Government begins to clean up its complex for producing nuclear weapons. As a legacy of 40 years of nuclear weapons production, the Energy Department has polluted vast areas and has thousands of buildings to decontaminate.</p> <p>The department says that the project is the largest environmental restoration project in history. It will require tearing down old structures and putting up factories to process wastes into safer forms and other &quot;engineered structures,&quot; from bunkers to fabricated caves, to store wastes. The project will also require constant attention to radiation exposure and to the potential for concentrating scraps of bomb fuel. If too much fuel is brought together, a chain reaction will result, creating a lethal shower of radiation and spreading the wastes.  Licenses Expiring</p> <p>At Pennsylvania State University, Edward H. Klevans, head of the nuclear program and an associate dean in the college of engineering, sees other reasons the nuclear industry may need more engineers. In the next few years some plants will approach the expiration of their 40-year operating licenses and will apply for extensions, Professor Klevans said. Recertifying them would require extensive engineering work.</p> <p>But even plant retirements will create jobs, he said, since the fuel must be carefully removed; then contaminated parts must be cleaned or painstakingly cut up with remote-controlled equipment for disposal, and worker exposure to radiation must be minimized.</p> <p>And new plants could be built. The energy bill that Congress passed last year simplifies the rules for licensing a new generation of power reactors, and smoothes the way for disposal of nuclear waste, in hopes of eventually spawning a rebirth of the technology.</p> <p>Indeed, by some projections there could be more jobs than people to fill them. A 1990 report by the National Academy of Sciences said that if orders for nuclear plants resume, the demand for nuclear engineers could double or triple. &quot;This demand would greatly exceed the output of current nuclear engineering programs even if they were to expand to full capacity,&quot; the study found.</p> <p>In case of shortage, the industry is likely to rely more heavily on other kinds of engineers, who would be specially trained for nuclear work. Already, nuclear engineering professors say, utilities are following this path. But people trained as nuclear engineers are better suited, experts in the field say, because they have a particularly broad background in physics, chemistry, fluid mechanics, and other areas.</p> <p>The civilian nuclear industry had hoped that its fortunes, and its recruits, would be strengthened by the public&#39;s recent focus on the environment. From acid rain to global warming, electric utilities are beset with problems that nuclear power would seem to sidestep.</p> <p>But that has not lured more students, said Kent F. Hansen, a professor of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a faculty member for 30 years. In discussions with students entering the field, Professor Hansen said, &quot;Only a few said they were concerned about nuclear being environmentally more benign than the alternatives.&quot;</p> <p>The reasons they did give, he said, were varied and pedestrian: Some had lived near nuclear plants; others had friends and neighbors who were nuclear engineers; still others were interested in an engineering field they consider more exotic than others.</p> <p>The industry is trying to shore up this educational base. The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, a utility group formed after the Three Mile Island accident to increase communication among utilities and bring peer pressure to bear on those with operating problems, last year sponsored 275 undergraduate scholarships and 40 graduate-level fellowships. One goal, said Angelina Howard, a spokeswoman, is to keep talented people &quot;going into the educational pipeline and coming out into the industry.&quot;</p> <p>But the key, Professor Hansen said, will be the new plant orders. &quot;I don&#39;t see how it can carry on without that happening,&quot; he said.</p>
1343608>Some Experts Suspect Engine Failure in Jet&#39;s Sudden Destruction The National Transportation Safety Board said tonight that a preliminary play-through here of the cockpit voice recorder from the American Airlines plane that crashed this morning near Kennedy International Airport showed that the crew was apparently unaware of a problem until just before the crash. The tape has a good quality recording, the board said. But in a news conference tonight at the airport, the board&#39;s chairwoman, Marion Blakey, and a member, George W. Black Jr., did not give a hint why the plane, an Airbus A-300, went down shortly after takeoff.  <p>Searchers have not yet found the other &#39;&#39;black box,&#39;&#39; the flight data recorder, and said tonight that they thought it might be in the waters of Jamaica Bay, where part of the tail was found. They may bring in sonar equipment to listen for a signal that the box gives off when immersed.</p> <p>The first briefing by the board illuminated little about the crash, but the fact that the safety board held the news conference indicated that the government still believed the cause was a mechanical failure and not terrorism, in which case the Federal Bureau of Investigation would have taken over.</p> <p>One of the few certainties about the crash was that the plane broke up in flight, a rare occurrence for a modern jetliner.</p> <p>Some aviation experts cast a suspicious eye on the engines, because engine failures have been known to cause crashes at that stage of flight. And the engine model on the American Airlines jet, the General Electric CF6, has a recent history of metallurgical problems that have required special inspections.</p> <p>But other experts said they did not see how such a failure could cause the debris pattern observed so far, including the upright part of the tail&#39;s being found in the Jamaica Bay, closer to the airport than the main part of the wreckage. Experts were not sure how engine failure had made that part of the tail leave the airplane early in the accident.</p> <p>Parts of the two engines were found separately, each about a quarter-mile from the main crash site,  indicating that they came off the plane not long before impact.</p> <p>The plane departed Runway 31L at Kennedy, heading northwest, and made a left turn, toward the south. Witnesses reported fire from an engine, but aviation experts say witness reports are not always reliable.</p> <p>Megadata, a company based in Greenwich, Conn., that tracks airplanes in flight, recorded Flight 587&#39;s takeoff at 9:14 a.m. and said its last appearance on radar was less than 90 seconds later, at 2,800 feet. The Megadata system eavesdrops on an F.A.A. radar system that locates the plane every 4.6 seconds, so the plane appears from the data to have fallen swiftly out of the sky. All 260 people aboard were killed in the crash, and six to nine people on the ground were reported missing.</p> <p>As is common in the early hours after a plane crash, there was a lot of information available today, but some of it was plainly wrong. Government officials said early on, for example, that the airplane appeared to have been dumping fuel, presumably in preparation for a return to the airport or a crash. But the A-300 has no fuel-dump system. Any fuel in the water could have come from ruptured tanks.</p> <p>The fuel and the tail in the water pointed some experts to one firm conclusion. &#39;&#39;If the tail came off and people are thinking the plane is dumping fuel, then the plane had a catastrophic structural failure,&#39;&#39; said an A-300 pilot for a different airline, who is a safety official at a pilots&#39; union. Beyond that, he said, it was difficult to establish what had happened.</p> <p>One possibility is what is known as uncontained engine failure, in which  the fan blades and turbine blades inside the jet come loose and shoot like missiles out of the engine. In July 1989, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 suffered an uncontained failure in the No. 2 engine, the one nestled inside the tail, and the blades sliced through the hydraulic lines, making stable flight impossible. The plane crashed near Sioux City, Iowa, killing 112 of the people on board.</p> <p>That engine was a CF6, of an earlier vintage than the one on the Airbus that crashed today, and the Airbus A-300 has no engine in its tail.</p> <p>Other uncontained engine failures have caused fatal accidents. But Dr. Merritt M. Birky, who retired last year after 17 years of investigating airplane fires and crashes for the National Transportation Safety Board, noted that most engine failures did not destroy planes.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;A failure or explosion in the engine itself doesn&#39;t usually dislodge the engine,&#39;&#39; Dr. Birky said.</p> <p>Engines do, of course, come loose, and several planes have crashed for that reason. But having the engine come off the plane does not generally make the plane break up.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;When you do lose an engine it can tear up the wing&#39;s leading edge a little bit or the trailing edge,&#39;&#39; Dr. Birky said. He added that Boeing aircraft had generally been more prone to having an engine mount break loose. But &#39;&#39;Airbus just doesn&#39;t have a history of that,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>Several aviation experts said it was too early to rule out a bomb. But one government official, referring to terrorism, said, &#39;&#39;we do not have any evidence for the T-word.&#39;&#39; Another possibility was hitting a flock of birds, which could damage the engines.</p> <p>All these causes were discussed before any substantial examination of the wreckage.</p> <p>The airplane that crashed was delivered new to American in July 1988 and was one of 35 A-300&#39;s operated by the airline. Airbus has delivered 761 of the planes, which are slightly longer than the Boeing 767 but with a shorter wingspan. A plane bound for Santo Domingo would be carrying about 50,000 pounds of fuel, or about 8,000 gallons.</p> <p>The plane&#39;s two CF6 engines, one under each wing, would have been at or near maximum thrust on departure. Fast-rotating internal parts have been known to come lose on such engines, sometimes penetrating the outer shell of the engine and sending parts as missiles into the plane. A CF6 engine on a Continental Airlines DC-10 broke up on takeoff from Newark International Airport in April 2000, and in June 2000, a CF6 on a Varig Airlines Boeing 767 broke up on takeoff from São Paulo, Brazil. In each case the planes did not crash.</p> <p>The engines are popular, however; they are used on Air Force One, among other planes.</p> <p>The failure in June 2000 led General Electric to develop what a spokesman, Rick Kennedy, called &#39;&#39;an aggressive inspection program,&#39;&#39; which the F.A.A. later made mandatory. And in September 2000, a failure on a US Airways plane led to more inspections.</p> <p>General Electric performs the maintenance and inspections on American&#39;s planes equipped with its engines, and it had completed inspections on the plane that crashed today, Mr. Kennedy said.</p> <p>THE CRASH OF FLIGHT 587: THE PLANE</p>
837932>New Rules on Air Traffic Control Would Let Pilots Choose Routes The Federal Aviation Administration said today that it would adopt a radically different concept of air traffic control in which pilots would pick their routes, altitudes and speeds, and air traffic controllers would intervene  only if flight plans conflicted. Proponents argue that this concept, called free flight, would save time for passengers and money for airlines by easing delays. Over the next 10 years, it would gradually replace the 35-year-old &quot;positive control&quot; system in which a controller at a radar screen orders every change a pilot makes.  <p>Under positive control, planes do not fly from one airport directly to another; they fly from one checkpoint in the sky to the next. As a result, they  end up flying extra miles in long lines, and bunching up at the checkpoints, producing delays.</p> <p>New technology to allow free flight is needed to enable the nation&#39;s air traffic system to handle the 40 percent increase in flights expected in the next 20 years, said the agency&#39;s Administrator, David R. Hinson.</p> <p>Mr. Hinson was backed up by representatives of the pilots, the air traffic controllers and the airlines.</p> <p>&quot;We will not be able to maintain our premier status in the world unless we take action now to provide improvements on our airspace,&quot; said Robert W. Baker,  executive vice president of American Airlines.</p> <p>Mr. Baker said that this year there would be 63.2 million landings and takeoffs and that by 2007 the number would reach 74.5 million. Shaving a few miles and a few minutes off each flight would add up to a major improvement for  both airlines and passengers, he and others said.</p> <p>A NASA study cited today by the aviation agency found that letting planes pick their own routes instead of following the airways laid out by the radio beacon routes would have saved $1.28 billion last year for the airlines. But most of the cost of delays is in lost time to passengers, which is difficult to  quantify.</p> <p>R. Michael Baiada, an aviation consultant who advocates free flight, estimated last year that airline productivity, as measured by how long it takes  to move planes from one point to another, had dropped 8 percent in the last 15 years.</p> <p>The aviation agency often finds it difficult to change its systems without the agreement of the many factions interested in airspace: airlines, cargo haulers, the Air Force, private plane owners, business jet operators, unions for pilots and air traffic controllers and even the airport authorities. For the moment, all these groups support free flight.</p> <p>The aviation agency said the new system would begin operating gradually in the coming years as more planes navigate by using the Global Positioning System, a network of satellites launched by the Pentagon, rather than the antiquated system of radio beacons now in use.</p> <p>The satellites allow anyone with specialized electronic receivers to pinpoint his position in three dimensions to within a few meters. Planes would radio their positions back to the ground, either directly or through communications satellites, and F.A.A. computers would then track them as blips on screens, rather than using radar, which is less accurate.</p> <p>Near airports, planes must now be separated by 1,000 feet in altitude and 3 miles horizontally; under free flight they could fly much closer together, F.A.A. officials said, because their positions would be known with much more precision.</p> <p>Under the free-flight concept, planes could reduce flight-path conflicts between them, according to Lane Speck, director of air traffic program integration for the F.A.A. &quot;If you spread the traffic out, what you do is you spread out the conflicts,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Under the concept as laid out today, a computer would assign each plane a &quot;protected zone,&quot; an area shaped like a hockey puck that was not to overlap with another under any circumstances, and a larger &quot;alert zone.&quot; When two alert zones overlapped, a computer would tell a human controller, and offer advice on what should be done. The size of the alert zone would depend on the planes&#39; speeds and other factors.</p> <p>All of this will require a new generation of computers and software, and acquiring them has always been a problem for the agency. Even with no unexpected glitches, phasing in free flight will take years, officials said, and they do not know precisely what the final system will look like.</p> <p>While the F.A.A. did not formally commit itself to widespread use of free flight until today, some aspects are already in use. For example, since 1992, some aircraft flying at high altitudes on routes of more than 300 nautical miles have been allowed to pick their own routes, and this has saved airlines millions of dollars in fuel and crew pay, officials say.</p> <p>In addition, last year the F.A.A. began using related technologies over the Pacific Ocean, where there is no radar. Planes belonging to Qantas, Northwest and United Air Lines figure their positions by using the Global Positioning System and send that information back by satellite to Oakland, Calif., where computers create a screen that looks like radar for the controllers. With clear  knowledge of where the planes are, the controllers can let them get closer together, and thereby direct more to the shortest routes or those where the winds are most favorable, Mr. Hinson said.</p> <p>The F.A.A. hopes to phase in one aspect of free flight soon. Now, under 10,000 feet, airplanes are restricted to climbing at speeds of 250 knots or below, but &quot;they should be climbing out in area of 330 knots,&quot; he said.</p>
472412>Oil-Spill Organization Gearing Up In partial fulfillment of a pledge made after the Exxon Valdez spill of March 1989, a not-for-profit oil industry organization announced yesterday that it had placed orders for 16 ships, complete with oil skimmers and containment boom systems, plus 20 miles of shoreline booms and other equipment, at a cost of $216 million. The Marine Spill Response Corporation, which is financed by oil companies, shippers and handlers and aims to become a kind of national fire department for oil spills, will fill many of the requirements of a law that came after the Valdez spill, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  <p>That act calls for a response system to be in place by February 1993. Costs are expected to run to $900 million over the first five years, and the orders announced today account for about half the capital cost, a spokesman, Gregory Rixon, said.</p> <p>The organization will operate from centers at Port Hueneme, near Los Angeles; Dodge Island, near Miami; and at locations yet to be determined near New York harbor, the Lake Charles area of Louisiana, and Seattle. The five sites will each be a home base for one of the ships. In addition, the corporation plans to &quot;preposition&quot; equipment in 22 sites on the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts, in Alaska, Hawaii and the United States Virgin Islands. Half of those sites will have a ship.</p> <p>The plan is to supply each regional center with enough equipment and manpower to make a &quot;best effort response&quot; to a spill the size of the Valdez, which involved more than nine million gallons of oil. Larger spills would be handled by equipment from more than one site.</p> <p>Mr. Rixon said the response time would vary with weather. But, he added, even in good weather reaching a spill can take a ship more than a day. Some equipment could also be transported by air, he added.</p> <p>The Alaska site will not have a ship, he said, because Alyeska, the pipline company, had improved its spill-fighting ability since the Valdez accident.</p> <p>But one environmental expert, Lisa Speer of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said more attention should be paid to Alaska because its coast is so long and because of plans for big offshore developments in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.</p> <p>She said cleanup equipment and research might be helpful but added that prevention was probably a better strategy, including new radar equpment and vessel traffic control systems -- some of which are being installed.</p> <p>According to Marine Spill Response, the ship order is among the largest nonmilitary orders for American shipyards in many years. Halter Marine Inc. of Gulfport, Miss., a subsidiary of Trinity Industries, and Bender Shipbuilding and Repair of Mobile, Ala., will build the 210-foot vessels.</p>
502092>New York Takes Hertz To Court Over Surcharge New York City and New York State sued Hertz yesterday over its two-week-old surcharge for renters from four New York City boroughs, calling it illegal discrimination. At a City Hall news conference announcing the suit, Robert Abrams, the Attorney General, said the Hertz Corporation &quot;can charge whatever rate it wants.&quot; But he added, &quot;What it cannot do is charge different people different rates based on where they live.&quot;  <p>The company said it was doing nothing wrong and would see the city and state in court.</p> <p>On Jan. 2, Hertz imposed a $56-a-day surcharge on Bronx residents and smaller fees for residents of Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The company, based in Park Ridge, N.J., said it was paying $15 million a year to settle suits brought by pedestrians, passengers and others injured in accidents with Hertz cars and a disproportionate number of those suits involved cars rented by people from those boroughs.</p> <p>In a statement yesterday, Hertz called the news conference &quot;little more than political posturing for publicity purposes.&quot; The company said that what it had done was &quot;reflective of real costs we&#39;ve incurred.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It is our fundamental belief that every company has a right to price its product in accordance with the costs associated with the delivery of that product,&quot; the company said. Joseph Russo, a Hertz spokesman, said that the company had not lost much business because of the change.</p> <p>But Mayor David N. Dinkins said at the news conference that the company, which is the nation&#39;s leading car rental concern, was approaching the problem the wrong way.</p> <p>&quot;If you want to discriminate on the basis of a person being a lousy driver, fine,&quot; he said. &quot;But it is unfair to target people for reasons unrelated to driving records.&quot; Move to Terminate Leases</p> <p>Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens, saying she was galled by Hertz charging extra to Queens residents when most of its New York City business is at the airports, added that she had asked the Port Authority to terminate Hertz&#39;s leases at LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark airports. She had previously called on the city to stop buying Fords because Ford owns 49 percent of Hertz, and Mr. Dinkins said yesterday that the city would consider it.</p> <p>While many officials have expressed outrage at the charges, Mr. Russo said yesterday that the company had not seen &quot;a significant negative impact.&quot;</p> <p>Some renters from the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens have decided to rent elsewhere, he said, but that was what the company wanted. In Manhattan, where the surcharge is $3 a day, he said, some customers &quot;make known that they are upset with the new rate structure, but we&#39;re trying to explain the reasons why.&quot; Nearly all go ahead and rent, he said.</p> <p>At Hertz&#39;s chief competitor, Avis, business was good, but Russell James, a spokesman, said that he could not attribute this to Hertz&#39;s surcharges.</p> <p>The suit filed by the city and state argues that the effect of the company&#39;s surcharges &quot;will fall disproportionately upon African-American, Latino and Asian-American residents.&quot; There is a rough correlation between the charges and the minority population of each borough. Hertz said that it found those accusations inflammatory, and that they were &quot;offensive and totally without merit.&quot;</p> <p>The suit also said that the policy &quot;inflicts significant economic, social and moral injury upon the state and city.&quot;</p>
1735782>Report Faults Rules and Judgment in Air Ambulance Accidents Air ambulance crashes killed 54 people, most of them pilots, paramedics and nurses, in a three-year period ending in early 2005, according to a special study by the National Transportation Safety Board. The report, which was approved by the board on Wednesday, concluded that pilots were not good at analyzing risks and that the rules are too lax for flights that are not carrying a patient or a donated organ.  <p>Helicopters and planes used as ambulances fly under airline-type rules when carrying a patient or organs. But if they are on their way to a pickup, they fly under rules that apply to private planes, which do not limit how many hours a pilot can work and allow flights in worse weather. Three-quarters of the accidents occurred under those rules.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;It seems like a ridiculous paper loophole that needs to be closed,&#39;&#39; said one member of the board, Debbie Hersman. &#39;&#39;You&#39;ve got one, two or three medical personnel on board, and they have organs in their bodies. They&#39;re just as important cargo as an organ for transplant.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Investigators also supported a formal program of &#39;&#39;flight risk evaluation,&#39;&#39; in which the pilot and possibly a second expert would dispassionately score each mission, based on weather conditions, time of day and other factors. Of the 55 accidents, 13 might not have occurred if such evaluations had been done, they said.</p> <p>While the number of crashes is up, including nine more crashes killing eight people since the end of the study, the rate of accidents is uncertain because of difficulties in determining the number of flights. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, there are about 650 emergency medical service helicopters; an industry group estimates there are more than 750.</p> <p>According to investigators, there were no accidents among &#39;&#39;public use&#39;&#39; aircraft, including those flown by police and fire departments. Government agencies tend to have dispatchers trained to obtain weather data and discuss conditions with the pilot, investigators said, adding that professional dispatching might have eliminated 11 of the 55 crashes.</p> <p>For example, a helicopter sent for a passenger in Newberry, S.C., in July 2004 ran into trees and crashed shortly after picking up the patient. The pilot, who was dispatched by a 911 operator, did not know that before he accepted the job that three other helicopter companies had turned it down because of weather conditions. Everyone on board died.</p> <p>Kitty Higgins, named to the safety board this month, referred to the problem as &#39;&#39;helicopter shopping.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>The safety board investigators said accidents could also be reduced by use of night-vision equipment and terrain warning systems.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, Alison Duquette, said that the technology was not well suited to helicopters because they sounded false alarms frequently at low altitudes, which is where helicopters often fly.</p> <p>A spokesman for the industry, Thomas P. Judge, a paramedic in Maine and the previous president of the Association of Air Medical Services, said that risk management programs would be helpful, but that applying airline rules to all flights would not. For example, Mr. Judge said, the airline rules require that before departure, the pilot receive a weather report on the destination from a source approved by the F.A.A. But the destination might turn out to be an isolated area for which no weather report was available.</p>
1788878>Bush Chooses Transportation Nominee President Bush said Tuesday that he would nominate Mary Peters, a strong advocate of bringing private companies into the construction and operation of highways, to be the next transportation secretary. Ms. Peters, a former head of the Arizona Transportation Department, served in Mr. Bush&#39;s first term as head of the Federal Highway Administration, then worked as an executive at a transportation engineering firm, HDR. If confirmed, which is likely, she would succeed Norman Y. Mineta, who announced in June that he would be resigning after five and a half years on the job.  <p>Appearing with Mr. Bush at the White House, Ms. Peters said the nation&#39;s transportation infrastructure was getting old.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We are experiencing increasing congestion on our nation&#39;s highways, railways, airports and seaports,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;And we&#39;re robbing our nation of productivity and our citizens of quality time with their families.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>Ms. Peters is a member of an advisory board created by the Reason Foundation, a conservative research and policy group. Robert Poole, the foundation&#39;s director of transportation, said Ms. Peters had been &#39;&#39;outspoken&#39;&#39; in advocating public-private partnerships for new roads, and getting away from the traditional model of using gasoline taxes. Revenue from those taxes has not kept up with the inflation in building costs, Mr. Poole said.</p> <p>As federal highway administrator, Ms. Peters helped push through a highway authorization bill that allows public highways to be turned over to private companies for maintenance and toll collection. She has also advocated time-of-day pricing at tollbooths and construction of roads by private firms.</p> <p>After the announcement, various people and transportation groups offered statements of praise, although several experts said they could not recall Ms. Peters&#39;s having taken a major public position on any transportation field outside highways.</p> <p>Jim May, president of the Air Transport Association, the trade group of the big airlines, said that Ms. Peters&#39;s position on highways represented an endorsement of user fees, and that he favored a user-fee structure for financing the air traffic control system, rather than the ticket tax now in place.</p>
659192>Keeping the Romance of the Fireplace Burning IT may look like ordinary firewood, complete with splinters and an occasional hitchhiking creepy-crawlie, but if it&#39;s sold in Manhattan its looks can deceive, and chances are it&#39;s not going to keep anyone warm. &quot;Social wood,&quot; one vendor calls it. Says another: &quot;We&#39;re selling ambiance.&quot; A log can sit unlighted for months, or even forever, such is the ornamental nature of the hearth in the caves of Manhattan. Here, a fireplace is as vestigial as a coal bin or hitching post (most urban fireplaces actually cool the rooms in which they burn, by sucking warm air up the chimney).  <p>Still, city dwellers, perhaps grasping at an image of a wholesome, L. L. Bean way of life, love the idea of a fire. They will pay a premium for an apartment with a mantel. There are only 10,000 or so working fireplaces left in Manhattan, and the number decreases whenever a building is remodeled and another use is found for the flue space.</p> <p>The firewood business in Manhattan is not like the wood business elsewhere: space is an issue, money is not. A cord, made up of the handy packages sold in groceries, would cost over $1,230, about 12 times what it fetches in rural areas.</p> <p>This, of course, is a bit like buying a case of whisky one shot at a time. But customers who have fireplaces are not usually counting pennies, or so says Kenneth F. Flowers, whose family has been selling wood in New York for 123 years. He would not disclose sales figures, but said they were steady.</p> <p>Mr. Flowers&#39;s great-great-grandfather, George M. Clark, went into the wood business in 1870, teaming up with Hartwell A. Wilkins the next year to form Clark &amp; Wilkins. The company has moved several times, usually after spectacular fires. It is now at 1871 Park Avenue at 128th Street in East Harlem.</p> <p>During the late 1800&#39;s, wood was shipped in by huge bargeloads; as the city shifted to coal, the company prospered by selling kindling for starting coal fires. With the demise of coal, Clark &amp; Wilkins began selling wood for fences.</p> <p>But even those days are past. When the Fire Department banned wooden fences in the late 1960&#39;s, the company moved into chain-link fence and wrought iron, and later into railings and other architectural metal. Clark &amp; Wilkins now buys wood from companies that cut timber in northern New York and Pennsylvania; most of it comes from second-growth trees, in reforested areas. The wood is cut in winter, when the sap is mostly out of the tree, stacked and left to dry for a year, Mr. Flowers said. No one knows exactly how much firewood is delivered to the city.</p> <p>The wood is stacked, then bagged in burlap and shipped -- by truck, not barge -- to a distributor, Plant Specialists of Long Island City, Queens. Other suppliers, who serve customers with more space, will deliver a cord (128 cubic feet) at a time, either in a heap or stacked, depending on price. For apartment dwellers, whether the wood is delivered in bulk or bought piecemeal from a grocer, storage becomes an issue.</p> <p>In fact, what makes firewood such a luxury in Manhattan is perhaps obvious: where to put it until it is burned. If a basement is used, the Fire Department says, the wood must be in its own room with sprinklers and self-closing doors. Since few New Yorkers have separate basements with sprinklers and self-closing doors, some people use a bathtub. Or they stash the wood under the grand piano.</p> <p>Neither is a good idea, said Francis J. McCabe, a Fire Department spokesman, and not only because of the fire risk. &quot;The wood would retain the moisture of the room, and it wouldn&#39;t burn properly,&quot; he said.</p> <p>In the country a cord of wood might cost $100 or less; in the city, $275. But most New Yorkers, because of the storage problem, buy wood in smaller amounts. A plastic-wrapped package with about nine pieces of hardwood (0.625 cubic feet) sells at grocery stands for around $6, hence that $1,230 urban cord.</p> <p>Distribution is expensive in the city, explained John Kelley, who selects the wood for Woodchuck Firewood and Cooking Wood Packaging Company on Staten Island.</p> <p>Another reason the price is high, he said, is that his company has had to change the way it dries wood. It used to take the wood chips, a waste created when wood is split, and burn them for heat to dry the logs. But the company had to shut down its kiln because of air pollution regulations. Now the wood has to air-dry, which takes longer, and so requires more space and more cost. And the chips now cost money to dispose of, $35 a ton.</p> <p>Clark &amp; Wilkins says a typical delivery to a Manhattan home, half a dozen of its burlap bags, runs about $90. That&#39;s for hardwoods; cherry is $117, apple $142. Clark &amp; Wilkins suggests bags of wood as gifts, an idea that might sound silly outside of New York.</p> <p>Mr. Kelley stressed that his product is premium wood. &quot;We call it social wood,&quot; he said, adding that it creates a warm feeling on holidays or at parties. &quot;The guy who buys it doesn&#39;t want any disappointment,&quot; he said. &quot;It has to burn. There is nothing more disappointing than a person buys a cord of wood, and it is wet.&quot;</p> <p>Woodchuck has designed a log mixture especially for New York City: hard-rock maple, hickory, cherry and oak. It makes a hot fire with relatively little smoke, Mr. Kelley said.</p> <p>Even within Manhattan there are submarkets. Upper West Side fireplaces generally run large enough for 24-inch logs, Mr. Flowers said, which is also a standard size in the other boroughs and suburbs, where space is less cramped. Upper East Side wood must usually be 16 inches long, he said, and Greenwich Village logs, smallest of all, are 12 inches. Some of what his company sells as wood would only be &quot;big kindling&quot; anywhere else, Mr. Flowers said.</p> <p>There is always the fire log, a concoction of sawdust and wax with copper compound thrown in for color. These are to the fireplace what takeout food is to the kitchen, clean and easy, if a little pricey. Duraflame, which dominates the market, sells a six-pound log for $2.50 or $3 in city supermarkets.</p> <p>&quot;Most people think this product would sell best in cold areas, but some of the best areas are where people want the ambiance,&quot; said Christopher P. Caron, a spokesman for Duraflame, of Stockton, Calif.</p> <p>Nationally, he said, 30 percent of the people with fireplaces use fire logs at least occasionally. The company does not keep sales statistics by city, but, he said, &quot;within the city, there&#39;s probably a much higher proportion of people who use artificial fireplace logs.&quot;</p> <p>A few years ago Clark &amp; Wilkins tried a paper-wrapped fireplace fuel designed to sell in supermarkets, called the Complete Fire, with sap-rich woods for easy ignition. It didn&#39;t sell, Mr. Flowers said, possibly because it cost more than a Duraflame. Jack Roth, the company president, said that Clark &amp; Wilkins had since given up on what he called the &quot;ease of use&quot; market.</p> <p>Even Mr. Roth&#39;s son Scott, a surgeon who lives on Long Island, has given up on the product his father sells. He uses Duraflame, the elder Mr. Roth acknowledged.</p> <p>NEW YORKERS &amp; CO.</p>
824037>Tests Show No Evidence of Drinking in Crash The captain of an American Airlines Boeing 757 that crashed near Cali, Colombia, on Dec. 20 was not drinking, the Colombian authorities have told the National Transportation Safety Board. A spokeswoman for the safety board, Julie Beale, said her agency had oral confirmation that prosecutors in Bogota had determined that the source of alcohol in the captain&#39;s body was fermentation of the remains, not ingestion. The information, which is the first official confirmation, came through the civil aviation authorities in Colombia, she said.  <p>The crash Dec. 20 killed 160 people and investigators have said the likely cause was pilot error.</p> <p>Shortly after the body of the captain, Nicholas Tafuri, 57 years old, of Marco Island, Fla., was recovered and analyzed, American Airlines said publicly  that it had been told by the Federal Aviation Administration that an American source in Bogota said preliminary results showed the presence of alcohol. American said it would be shocked if he had been drinking. The F.A.A. then confirmed the report. But the source of the alcohol was unclear.</p> <p>Over the weekend, American issued another statement, saying it was glad to hear that the new tests showed the captain had not been drinking. &quot;We regret, however, that a leak of premature, inconclusive and incomplete forensic test data cast doubt on the conduct of our crew,&quot; the company said in a statement. &quot;The final test results, releasted today, underscore once again why speculation is the evil of all accident investigations, and why all responsible  parties should instead await the outcome of an exhaustive investigative process.&quot;</p> <p>Asked why American had made its original announcement about the ambiguous intitial tests, a spokesman for the airline, Al Becker, said today that the company had had &quot;media inquiries&quot; about the tests and thought they would become  public no matter what it did.</p>
1340730>Officials Fear Reactors Are Vulnerable to Attacks by Terrorists As they survey the industrial landscape for objects that terrorists could turn into weapons, members of Congress, governors and others are showing growing anxiety about the vulnerability of nuclear reactors, and especially their spent fuel. The Coast Guard and the National Guard are already patrolling many plants, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission says improvements have been made since Sept. 11 to make reactors less susceptible to sabotage. The industry emphasizes that many design features intended to protect plants against accident result in &#39;&#39;robust&#39;&#39; structures that are also resistant to military attack.  <p>But studies that were available until recently on the Internet are being cited by a variety of others as reason to worry. One, done 20 years ago for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, raises the possibility of an airplane crashing into a containment dome or some less-hardened part of a reactor and causing a meltdown. Another, dated September 2000, suggests that breaching a cask used to store spent fuel would create a lethal radiation dose in an area many times larger than that caused by a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon.</p> <p>Other experts note that the spent fuel pools can contain 20 to 30 times as much radioactive material as the reactor core does. And the pools are in buildings not nearly as strong as those that house the reactors.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I&#39;m not so worried about the core; I&#39;m worried about the spent fuel pool,&#39;&#39; said Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, who has asked for the establishment of a permanent five-mile no-flight zone around the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant in the southeastern corner of his state. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s basically no protection there,&#39;&#39; he said in a telephone interview.</p> <p>Experts disagree about the extent of the vulnerability, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the industry say there is no cause for alarm. But the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted Thursday to require the commission to review the potential for attacks on nuclear plants , specifically to identify a new &#39;&#39;design basis threat,&#39;&#39; or threat around which the plant&#39;s defenses are geared. The commission had opposed the amendment.</p> <p>The provision&#39;s author, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, is a longtime opponent of the industry. Still, he won the near-unanimous agreement of his colleagues. &#39;&#39;The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is refusing to take up the question at all,&#39;&#39; Mr. Markey said. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re mandating that they take it up.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>His amendment would also guarantee the continued existence of the office within the N.R.C. that evaluates physical protection at reactors. Before Sept. 11, the agency had a plan to turn that function over to an industry group, which it said could run tests more frequently.</p> <p>The details of the design basis threat against which the plants are tested are classified, but the threat is known to be a commando-type attack. Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a nonproliferation group, suggested today that the basis should be &#39;&#39;19 suicidal terrorists, technically sophisticated, coming at you from different directions.&#39;&#39; That would describe the groups that hijacked four airliners on Sept. 11.</p> <p>Some arguments are revised versions of the case that opponents have made against nuclear power for years. &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve never heard of a terrorist taking aim at a wind turbine,&#39;&#39; said Anna Aurelio, legislative director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which favors ending the use of nuclear power.</p> <p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#39;s chairman, Richard Meserve, said that various improvements had been made since Sept. 11, but he added that reactors were smaller than either the World Trade Center towers or the Pentagon and, thus, more difficult to crash into. &#39;&#39;It would not be a trivial thing to have a kamikaze attack,&#39;&#39; Mr. Meserve said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s a lot harder to hit than the World Trade Center.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>&#39;&#39;We have all kinds of infrastructure in this country that is vulnerable to aircraft,&#39;&#39; he added. &#39;&#39;You think about dams, chemical plants, refineries, skyscrapers, pipelines, any number of things.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;I don&#39;t particularly lose any sleep over collisions with spent fuel pools, as compared to those other things.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>But threats to the nation&#39;s nuclear power industry have new resonance with some elected officials since the hijackings. &#39;&#39;The risk assessment that existed prior to Sept. 11 is clearly inadequate,&#39;&#39; Representative Peter Deutsch, a Florida Democrat who is another member of the Energy and Commerce committee, said at the committee&#39;s meeting on Thursday. He said that a reassessment was urgently needed because some threats were clearly beyond what a private company could defend against and would require government action. In a telephone interview, he added that it was clear that the reactor containment would not be the only possible target.</p> <p>While the most obvious area of concern at a nuclear plant is the reactor, which operates under high temperatures and pressures and could vent radioactive steam in an accident, the bulk of the radioactive material at most plants is in the spent fuel pool.</p> <p>The radioisotopes, like cesium and strontium, are created in the reactor by splitting uranium. Since the fuel is moved from the reactor after about three years, it begins to accumulate in the spent fuel pool. While there, it sits under about 25 feet of water, which shields the radiation and carries off the heat that continues to emanate from the fuel.</p> <p>The industry estimates that even if all cooling stopped, the water would not begin boiling for 20 to 40 hours, and that even if it boiled, all that would be needed to end the problem is to add more water through something as simple as a fire hose. &#39;&#39;These are huge structures, with a lot of inertia,&#39;&#39; said Lynnette Hendricks, director of licensing at the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry&#39;s trade association.</p> <p>Critics say that if the fuel were allowed to get too hot, it could ignite the cladding -- a metal called zirconium -- that holds the uranium fuel in place. The metal was selected primarily because it can be easily penetrated by neutrons, the sub-atomic particles that sustain a chain reaction.</p> <p>But a petition filed earlier this week with the N.R.C. by a nuclear safety group argued that the zirconium could provide the chemical energy to fuel a fire that would disperse the radioactive materials. The group was seeking to prevent the owners of the Millstone nuclear plant, in Waterford, Conn., from storing more fuel in a pool there.</p> <p>Until recently, the commission&#39;s staff said that zirconium would not burn once the fuel was a few years old, and its heat production was reduced as some of the radiation died off. But earlier this year, the staff retreated from that position.</p> <p>Still, Ms. Hendricks said that to set up a situation in which such a fire could occur, &#39;&#39;you need to hook up a lot of &#39;what-ifs.&#39; &#39;&#39;</p> <p>The other way to store fuel is to put it in dry casks, massive concrete and steel boxes filled with inert gas. Before Sept. 11, safety advocates and nuclear engineers described this as safer, at least for older fuel, because it used no water for fuel to leak into and no pumps to fail.</p> <p>But the casks sit outside the plant buildings, sometimes in sight from roads or nearby hillsides. They have been tested for transit accidents, but their security against attack with an antitank weapon or other armament is less certain.</p> <p>A draft study by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements discussed the risk of shipping spent fuel and calculated that breaching a cask could produce a lethal radiation dose in an area of 2,700 square kilometers. In comparison, the study said, a 10-kiloton nuclear blast would produce those doses in 47 square kilometers.</p> <p>Government officials note, though, that creating a hole in a cask is not the same as dispersing its contents; dispersion would depend on the size of the breach and the energy available to break up the fuel.</p> <p>The federal government was supposed to take responsibility for disposing of civilian reactor fuel in 1998, but the plan is now more than 10 years behind schedule. The Energy Department is trying to demonstrate that Yucca Mountain, near Las Vegas, is a suitable spot for deep burial, but has encountered a variety of problems.</p> <p>So the spent fuel risk, however great it turns out to be, will stay with the plants for years to come. In Wiscasset, Maine, where the Maine Yankee nuclear plant used to operate, the state is demanding the fuel be hauled out. Otherwise, the site could become, in the words of Paula Craighead, the state&#39;s nuclear safety adviser, &#39;&#39;Yucca Mountain without the mountain.&#39;&#39;</p> <p>A NATION CHALLENGED: THE NUCLEAR THREAT</p>
1575010>Panel Clears Handling by U.S. of bin Laden Kin The six chartered flights that rushed scores of Saudi citizens out of the United States after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were handled properly by the Bush administration, the independent commission investigating the attacks said in a statement on Tuesday. A flight on Sept. 20, 2001, carried 26 passengers, most of them relatives of Osama bin Laden, according to the statement. But all 142 passengers on the flights, mostly Saudi citizens, were screened by law enforcement officials, the statement said, to ensure that they were not security threats and not wanted for questioning. The flights were &#39;&#39;dealt with in a professional manner&#39;&#39; by the government, the commission said.  <p>The rush by the Saudis to depart attracted notice and stirred accusations that the administration allowed it to take place to maintain good relations with the Saudis. An article in Vanity Fair magazine last October asserted that the Saudis were allowed by the White House to violate a ban on flights imposed after the attacks to fly a group from Tampa, Fla., to Lexington, Ky., in a small jet, where they would join a larger group. But the Federal Aviation Administration maintained that the ban was lifted before the plane took off.</p> <p>Among other critics, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said last September that some of the Saudis who were allowed to leave may have had ties to terrorism. &#39;&#39;This is just another example of our country coddling the Saudis and giving them special privileges that others would never get,&#39;&#39; he said.</p> <p>But according to the statement, the F.B.I. checked &#39;&#39;a variety of databases&#39;&#39; and searched the aircraft. The statement said that it was not clear whether anyone checked a watch list maintained by the State Department, but that a check after the departure showed no matches.</p> <p>The statement said the F.B.I. concluded that no one who was allowed to depart was wanted for questioning, and that the commission had found no evidence to contradict this.</p> <p>THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE SAUDIS</p>
